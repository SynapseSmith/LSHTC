0,Phytoplasmas are insect-vectored bacteria that cause disease in a wide range of plant species. The increasing availability of molecular DNA analyses. expertise and additional methods in recent years has led to a proliferation of discoveries of phytoplasma-plant host associations and in the numbers of taxonomic groupings for phytoplasmas. The widespread use of common names based on the diseases with which they are associated. as well as separate phenetic and taxonomic systems for classifying phytoplasmas based on variation at the 16S rRNA-encoding gene. complicates interpretation of the literature. We explore this issue and related trends through a focus on Australian pathosystems. providing the first comprehensive compilation of information for this continent. covering the phytoplasmas. host plants. vectors and diseases. Of the 33 16Sr groups reported internationally. only groups I. II. III. X. XI and XII have been recorded in Australia and this highlights the need for ongoing biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction of additional pathogen groups. Many of the phytoplasmas reported in Australia have not been sufficiently well studied to assign them to 16Sr groups so it is likely that unrecognized groups and sub-groups are present. Wide host plant ranges are apparent among well studied phytoplasmas. with multiple crop and non-crop species infected by some. Disease management is further complicated by the fact that putative vectors have been identified for few phytoplasmas. especially in Australia. Despite rapid progress in recent years using molecular approaches. phytoplasmas remain the least well studied group of plant pathogens. making them a "crouching tiger" disease threat....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Molecular biology
0,Background: (-)-alpha-Bisabolol. also known as levomenol. is an unsaturated sesquiterpene alcohol that has mainly been used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products due to its anti-inflammatory and skin-soothing properties. (-)-alpha-Bisabolol is currently manufactured mainly by steam-distillation of the essential oils extracted from the Brazilian candeia tree that is under threat because its natural habitat is constantly shrinking. Therefore. microbial production of (-)-alpha-bisabolol plays a key role in the development of its sustainable production from renewable feedstock. Results: Here. we created an Escherichia coli strain producing (-)-alpha-bisabolol at high titer and developed an in situ extraction method of (-)-alpha-bisabolol. using natural vegetable oils. We expressed a recently identified (-)-alpha-bisabolol synthase isolated from German chamomile (Matricaria recutita) (titer: 3 mg/L). converted the acetyl-CoA to mevalonate. using the biosynthetic mevalonate pathway (12.8 mg/L). and overexpressed farnesyl diphosphate synthase to efficiently supply the (-)-alpha-bisabolol precursor farnesyl diphosphate. Combinatorial expression of the exogenous mevalonate pathway and farnesyl diphosphate synthase enabled a dramatic increase in (-)-alpha-bisabolol production in the shake flask culture (80 mg/L) and 5 L bioreactor culture (342 mg/L) of engineered E. coli harboring (-)-alpha-bisabolol synthase. Fed-batch fermentation using a 50 L fermenter was conducted after optimizing culture conditions. resulting in efficient (-)-alpha-bisabolol production with a titer of 9.1 g/L. Moreover. a green. downstream extraction process using vegetable oils was developed for in situ extraction of (-)-alpha-bisabolol during fermentation and showed high yield recovery (>98%). Conclusions: The engineered E. coli strains and economically viable extraction process developed in this study will serve as promising platforms for further development of microbial production of (-)-alpha-bisabolol at large scale....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Enzymology
1,A universal feature of the replication of positive-strand RNA viruses is the association with intracellular membranes. Carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) replication in plants occurs in vesicles derived from the mitochondrial outer membrane. The product encoded by CIRV ORF1. p36. is required for targeting the virus replication complex to the outer mitochondrial membrane both in plant and yeast cells. Here the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a model host to study the effect of CIRV p36 on cell survival and death. It was shown that p36 does not promote cell death. but decreases cell growth rate. In addition. p36 changed the nature of acetic acid-induced cell death in yeast by increasing the number of cells dying by necrosis with concomitant decrease of the number of cells dying by programmed cell death. as judged by measurements of phosphatidylserine externalization. The tight association of p36 to membranes was not affected by acetic acid treatment. thus confirming the peculiar and independent interaction of CIRV p36 with mitochondria in yeast. This work proved yeast as an invaluable model organism to study both the mitochondrial determinants of the type of cell death in response to stress and the molecular pathogenesis of (+)RNA viruses.

2,1.2-Dichloropropane (1.2-DCP) and dichloromethane (DCM) are possible causative agents associated with the development of cholangiocarcinoma in employees working in printing plant in Osaka. Japan. However. few reports have demonstrated an association between these agents and cholangiocarcinoma in rodent carcinogenicity studies. Moreover. the combined effects of these compounds have not been fully elucidated. In the present study. we evaluated the in vivo mutagenicity of 1.2-DCP and DCM. alone or combined. in the livers of gpt delta rats. Six-week-old male F344 gpt delta rats were treated with 1.2-DCP. DCM or 1.2-DCP+DCM by oral administration for 4weeks at the dose (200mgkg(-1) body weight 1.2-DCP and 500mgkg(-1) body weight DCM) used in the carcinogenesis study performed by the National Toxicology Program. In vivo mutagenicity was analyzed by gpt mutation/Spi(-) assays in the livers of rats. In addition. gene and protein expression of CYP2E1 and GSTT1. the major enzymes responsible for the genotoxic effects of 1.2-DCP and DCM. were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Gpt and Spi(-) mutation frequencies were not increased by 1.2-DCP and/or DCM in any group. Additionally. there were no significant changes in the gene and protein expression of CYP2E1 and GSTT1 in any group. These results indicated that 1.2-DCP. DCM and 1.2-DCP+DCM had no significant impact on mutagenicity in the livers of gpt delta rats under our experimental conditions. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons.

3,This paper presents the simulation results of a linear. fully integrated. two-stage digitally programmable 130 nm CMOS power amplifier (PA) operating at 2.4 GHz. Its power stage is composed of a set of amplifying cells which can be enabled or disabled independently by a digital control circuit. All seven operational modes are univocal in terms of 1 dB output compression point (OCP1dB). saturated output power (P-SAT) and power gain at 2.4 GHz. The lowest power mode achieves an 8.1 dBm P-SAT. a 13.5 dB power gain and consumes 171 mW DC power (P-DC) at an OCP1dB of 6 dBm. whereas the highest power mode reaches an 18.9 dBm P-SAT and a 21.1 dB power gain and consumes 415 mW P-DC at an OCP1dB of 18.2 dBm....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
4,The glycogen branching enzyme (EC 2.4.1.18). which catalyses the formation of alpha-1.6-glycosidic branch points in glycogen structure. is often used to enhance the nutritional value and quality of food and beverages. In order to be applicable in industries. enzymes that are stable and active at high temperature are much desired. Using genome mining. the nucleotide sequence of the branching enzyme gene (glgB) was extracted from the Geobacillus mahadia Geo-05 genome sequence provided by the Malaysia Genome Institute. The size of the gene is 2013 bp. and the theoretical molecular weight of the protein is 78.43 kDa. The gene sequence was then used to predict the thermostability. function and the three dimensional structure of the enzyme. The gene was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli to verify the predicted result experimentally. The purified enzyme was used to study the effect of temperature and pH on enzyme activity and stability. and the inhibitory effect by metal ion on enzyme activity. This thermostable glycogen branching enzyme was found to be most active at 55 degrees C. and the half-life at 60 degrees C and 70 degrees C was 24 h and 5 h. respectively. From this research. a thermostable glycogen branching enzyme was successfully isolated from Geobacillus mahadia Geo-05 by genome mining together with molecular biology technique....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Enzymology
5,The microbial populations in the activated sludge of two Polish wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were identified and quantified using Illumina sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA amplicons over a 2-year period. Their dynamics over time were compared to Danish WWTPs (data collected in previous studies by Center for Microbial Communities. Aalborg University). The bacterial communities in Polish and Danish WWTPs were similar to each other. but the microbial diversity in Polish WWTPs was lower. The dominant genera in Polish WWTPs were more abundant than in Danish WWTPs; 30 of them constituted more than half the of activated sludge community. Polish WWTPs showed a higher abundance of bacteria involved in nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand removal (Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes). while polyphosphate-acculumating bacteria were the dominant bacterial group in Danish plants. The microbial community structures in the examined Polish WWTPs were relatively similar to each other and showed strong seasonal variations which are not normally observed in Danish WWTPs....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,DNA/RNA sequencing
6,Background: Broad-range 16S rRNA PCR can be used for the detection and identification of bacteria from clinical specimens in patients for whom there is a high suspicion of infection and cultures are negative. The aims of this study were (1) to compare 16S rRNA PCR results with microbiolog ical culture results. (2) to assess the utility of 16S rRNA PCR with regard to antimicrobial therapy. and (3) to compare the yield of 16S rRNA PCR for different types of clinical specimen and to perform a cost analysis of the test. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on different clinical specimens which had 16S performed over 3 years (2012-2015). Standard microbiological cultures were performed on appropriate media. as per the laboratory protocol. Patient clinical and microbiological data were obtained from the electronic medical records and laboratory information system. respectively. 16S rRNA PCR was performed in a reference laboratory using a validated method for amplification and sequencing. The outcomes assessed were the performance of 16S rRNA PCR. change of antimicrobials (rationalization. cessation. or addition). and duration of therapy. Concordance of 16S rRNA PCR with bacterial cultures was also determined for tissue specimens. Results: Thirty-two patients were included in the study. for whom an equal number of specimens (n = 32) were sent for 16S rRNA PCR. 16S rRNA PCR could identify an organism in 10 of 32 cases (31.2%). of which seven were culture-positive and three were culture-negative. The sensitivity was 58% (confidence interval (CI) 28.59-83.5%) and specificity was 85% (CI 61.13-96%). with a positive predictive value of 70% (CI 35.3-91.9%) and negative predictive value of 77.2% (CI 54.17-91.3%). Antimicrobial therapy was rationalized after 16S rRNA PCR results in five patients (15.6%) and was ceased in four based on negative results (12.5%). Overall the 16S rRNA PCR result had an impact on antimicrobial therapy in 28% of patients (9/32). The highest concordance of 16S rRNA PCR with bacterial culture was found for heart valve tissue (80%). followed by joint fluid/tissue (50%). Conclusions: Despite the low diagnostic yield. results of 16S rRNA PCR can still have a significant impact on patient management due to rationalization or cessation of the antimicrobial therapy. The yield of 16S rRNA PCR was highest for heart valves. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

7,Brinjal little leaf (BLL) is a widespread disease of phytoplasma etiology in India that induces severe economic losses. Surveys were conducted in eight brinjalgrowing states of India during July 2014 to September 2015 and eighteen BLL samples showing little leaf. phyllody and witches' broom symptoms were collected for phytoplasma identification. Presence of phytoplasmas was confirmed in all the eighteen BLL samples using polymerase chain reaction with phytoplasma-specific primer pairs (P1/P6. R16F2n/R16R2). Pair wise sequence comparison and phylogenetic relationship of 16S rRNA gene sequences of BLL phytoplasma strains confirmed that sixteen out of eighteen BLL strains belonged to clover proliferation phytoplasma (16SrVI) group and two BLL strains (GKP-A and GKP-B) from Gorakhpur. Uttar Pradesh. were classified under 16SrII group. Further virtual RFLP analysis of 16S rDNA sequences allowed finer classification of BLL strains into 16SrII-D and 16SrVI-D subgroups. BLL phytoplasma strains belonging to 16SrVI-D subgroup were found as the most widespread phytoplasma strains associated with BLL disease in India. 16SrVI-D subgroup phytoplasma association with two symptomatic weed species viz. Cannabis sativa subsp. sativa at Noida. Uttar Pradesh and Portulaca oleracea at IARI fields. New Delhi was also confirmed by nested PCR assays with similar set of phytoplasma-specific primers. pairwise 16S rDNA sequence comparison. phylogeny and virtual RFLP analysis. Out of five identified leafhopper species from BLL-infected fields at Noida. Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. only Hishimonas phycitis was identified as carrier and natural vector of 16SrVI-D subgroup of phytoplasmas by nested PCR assays. sequence comparison. phylogeny. virtual RFLP analysis and transmission assays....,biochemistry,MAE,Polymerase chain reaction,Fluid mechanics
8,Surveys for the Cote d'Ivoire lethal yellowing (CILY) phytoplasma were conducted in eight severely CILY-affected villages of Grand-Lahou in 2015. Leaves. inflorescences and trunk borings were collected from coconut palms showing CILY symptoms and from symptomless trees. Total DNA was extracted from these samples and tested by nested polymerase chain reaction/RFLP and sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA. ribosomal protein (rp) and the translocation protein (secA) genes. The CILY phytoplasma was detected in 82.9% of the symptom-bearing palms collected from all the surveyed villages and from all the plant parts. Trunk borings were recommended as the most suitable plant tissue type for sampling. Results indicate that the CILY phytoplasma may have a westward spread to other coconut-growing areas of Grand-Lahou. CILY phytoplasma strains infecting coconut palms in the western region of Grand-Lahou exhibited unique single nucleotide polymorphisms on the rp sequence compared to the strains from the eastern region. Moreover. single nucleotide polymorphisms on the SecA sequence distinguished the CILY phytoplasma from the Cape St. Paul Wilt Disease phytoplasma in Ghana. and the Lethal Yellowing phytoplasma in Mozambique....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Molecular biology
9,Advances in sequencing technologies continue to provide unprecedented opportunities to characterize microbial communities. For example. the Pacific Biosciences Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) platform has emerged as a unique approach harnessing DNA polymerase activity to sequence template molecules. enabling long reads at low costs. With the aim to simultaneously classify and enumerate in situ microbial populations. we developed a quantitative SMRT (qSMRT) approach that involves the addition of exogenous standards to quantify ribosomal amplicons derived from environmental samples. The V7-9 regions of 18S SSU rDNA were targeted and quantified from protistan community samples collected in the Ross Sea during the Austral summer of 2011. We used three standards of different length and optimized conditions to obtain accurate quantitative retrieval across the range of expected amplicon sizes. a necessary criterion for analyzing taxonomically diverse 18S rDNA molecules from natural environments. The ability to concurrently identify and quantify microorganisms in their natural environment makes qSMRT a powerful. rapid and cost-effective approach for defining ecosystem diversity and function.

10,1A6/DRIM is a nucleolar protein with a nucleolar targeting sequence in its 3'-terminus. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that human 1A6/ DRIM shares 23% identity and 43% similarity with yeast Utp20. which has been reported as a component of U3 snoRNA protein complex and has been implicated in 18S rRNA processing. In the present study. we found. by utilizing RT-PCR with RNA extracted from anti-1A6/DRIM inummoprecipitates and Northern blotting. that 1A6/DRIM is associated with U3 snoRNA. Pulse-chase labeling assays showed that silencing of 1A6/DRIM expression in HeLa cells resulted in a delayed 18S rRNA processing. Furthermore. immunoprecipitations revealed that 1A6/DRIM was also associated with fibrillarin. another U3 RNP component in HeLa cells. These results indicate that 1A6/DRIM is involved in 18S rRNA processing and is the bona fide mammalian Utp20. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

11,Aims: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a neurogenetic condition associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. Previous studies have shown that negative symptoms represent the most specific clinical characteristic of psychosis in 22q11.2DS and are strongly associated with outcome. However. the psychological mechanisms associated with these symptoms in this population are poorly understood. In accordance with recent conceptualizations in the field of schizophrenia. the present study aims at investigating whether negative symptoms are associated with the presence of negative performance beliefs and cognitive deficits. Methods: Thirty-five participants with 22q11.2DS and 24 typically developing individuals aged between 11 and 24 years were included in the study. Self-reported schizotypal symptoms (cognitive-perceptual. paranoid. negative and disorganization symptoms) and dysfunctional beliefs (negative performance beliefs and need for approval) were assessed. Measures of processing speed. verbal memory. working memory. executive functioning and face recognition-were also extracted from a broad cognitive evaluation protocol. Results: Adolescents with 22q11.2DS reported significantly higher score on the negative dimension of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire than controls. even when controlling for the influence of anxiety/depression and intellectual functioning. Negative and paranoid symptoms were associated with the severity of negative performance beliefs and lower face recognition abilities. Mediation analyses revealed that negative performance beliefs significantly mediated the association between face recognition and negative/paranoid symptoms. Conclusions: These findings suggest that negative performance beliefs and basic social cognitive mechanisms are associated with negative and paranoid symptoms in individuals with 22q11.2DS. Implications for intervention are discussed in this article....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Schizophrenia
12,Background: Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a neurogenetic disorder that is associated with a 25-fold increase in schizophrenia. Both individuals with 22q11.2DS and those with schizophrenia present with social cognitive deficits. which are putatively subserved by a network of brain regions that are involved in the processing of social cognitive information. This study used two-tensor tractography to examine the white matter tracts believed to underlie the social brain network in a group of 57 young adults with 22q11.2DS compared to 30 unaffected controls. Results: Results indicated that relative to controls. participants with 22q11.2DS showed significant differences in several DTI metrics within the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. cingulum bundle. thalamo-frontal tract. and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. In addition. participants with 22q11.2DS showed significant differences in scores on measures of social cognition. including the Social Responsiveness Scale and Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. Further analyses among individuals with 22q11.2DS demonstrated an association between DTI metrics and positive and negative symptoms of psychosis. as well as differentiation between individuals with 22q11.2DS and overt psychosis. relative to those with positive prodromal symptoms or no psychosis. Conclusions: Findings suggest that white matter disruption. specifically disrupted axonal coherence in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. may be a biomarker for social cognitive difficulties and psychosis in individuals with 22q11.2DS....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Schizophrenia
13,Through the comprehensive analysis of the genomic DNA sequence of human chromosome 22. we identified a novel gene of 702 kb encoding a big protein of 2481 amino acid residues. and named it as TPRBK (TPR containing big gene cloned at Keio). A novel protein TPRBK possesses 25 units of the TPR motif. which has been known to associate with a diverse range of biological functions. Orthologous genes of human TPRBK were found widely in animal species. from insecta to mammal. but not found in plants. fungi and nematoda. Northern blotting and RT-PCR analyses revealed that TPRBK gene is expressed ubiquitously in the human and mouse fetal tissues and various cell lines of human. monkey and mouse. lmmunofluorescent staining of the synchronized monkey COS-7 cells with several relevant antibodies indicated that TPRBK changes its subcellular localization during the cell cycle: at interphase TPRBK locates on the centrosomes. during mitosis it translocates from spindle poles to mitotic spindles then to spindle midzone. and through a period of cytokinesis it stays on the midbody. Co-immunoprecipitation assay and immunofluorescent staining with adequate antibodies revealed that TPRBK binds to Aurora B. and those proteins together translocate throughout mitosis and cytokinesis. Treatments of cells with two drugs (Blebbistatin and Y-27632). that are known to inhibit the contractility of actin-myosin. disturbed the proper intracellular localization of TPRBK. Moreover. the knockdown of TPRBK expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed the bundling of spindle midzone microtubules and disrupted the midbody formation. arresting the cells at G(2) + M phase. These observations indicated that a novel big protein TPRBK is essential for the formation and integrity of the midbody. hence we postulated that TPRBK plays a critical role in the progress of mitosis and cytokinesis during mammalian cell cycle.

14,Graphene and other two-dimensional materials have received considerable attention regarding their potential applications in nano-electronics. Here. we report top-gate nonvolatile memory field-effect transistors (FETs) with different layers of MoSe2 nanosheets channel gated by ferroelectric film. The conventional gate dielectric of FETs was replaced by a ferroelectric thin film that provides a ferroelectric polarization electric field. and therefore defined as an Fe-FET where the poly (vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) was used as the gate dielectric. Among the devices with MoSe2 channels of different thicknesses. the device with a single layer of MoSe2 exhibited a large hysteresis of electronic transport with an over 10(5) write/erase ratio. and displayed excellent retention and endurance performance. The possible mechanism of the device's good properties was qualitatively analyzed using band theory. Additionally. a comprehensive study comparing the memory properties of MoSe2 channels of different thicknesses is presented. Increasing the numbers of MoSe2 layers was found to cause a reduced memory window. However. MoSe2 thickness of 5 nm yielded a write/erase ratio of more than 10(3). The results indicate that. based on a Fe-FET structure. the combination of two-dimensional semiconductors and organic ferroelectric gate dielectrics shows good promise for future applications in nonvolatile ferroelectric memory....,Psychology,ECE,Attention,Electrical circuits
15,Relationships between the abundance of potential geosmin- and 2-methylisoborneol-producing (2-MIB) cyanobacteria and bacteria. and concentrations of the two taste and odour compounds (T&Os) were examined in a 7 day incubation of natural water from the surface and bottom of three reservoirs in southeast Queensland. Australia. Only a single known T&O-producing cyanobacterium (Geitlerinema spp.) was detected by microscopy at low density. and only in one reservoir. Densities of potential T&O-producing Streptomyces (determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay) were highest in the bottom water and varied from 0.7 x 10(3) to 775 x 10(3) cells L-1. Geosmin ranged from 6 to 59 ng L-1 (with the highest concentrations in the bottom water). while 2-MIB varied from 6 to 47 ng L-1 (with the highest concentration in surface water). Concentrations of both compounds declined during the incubation under both light and dark conditions. Presence of the geosmin synthase gene. geoA. in cyanobacteria and Streptomyces was examined by different PCR approaches. Cloning of PCR products from amplification of geoA showed a high similarity to geoA in cyanobacteria. but not to streptomycetes. Our results demonstrate that more research on the ecology and molecular biology of T&O producers is required to better understand the dynamics of T&Os and to monitor emerging T&O episodes....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Molecular biology
16,We have carried out animal toxicity tests of chemicals for a chemical safety program implemented by the Ministry of Economy. Trade. and Industry of Japan. Here. we tested 1-tert-butoxy-4-chlorobenzene in a combined repeat-dose and developmental and reproductive toxicity test. The test chemical was administered daily by gavage to 9-week-old Crl:CD (SD) rats at doses of 0. 20. 100. and 500 mg/kg/d. Males were treated for 42 d beginning 14 d before mating. Females were treated from 14 d before mating to day 4 of lactation. Decreased spontaneous locomotion. decreased respiratory rate. and incomplete eyelid opening were observed at 500 mg/kg/d (both sexes). but resolved within 30 min of administration. suggesting central nervous system depression. No notable changes were observed in body weight. food consumption. functional battery tests. or blood test. Increased liver weight with centrilobular or diffuse hepatocyte hypertrophy was observed at 100 and 500 mg/kg/d (both sexes). There were no biochemical or histopathological changes related to hepatotoxicity. Increased kidney weight with basophilic tubules. tubule dilatation. and increased hyaline droplets were observed in males dosed at 100 and 500 mg/kg/d. Immunohistochemical staining indicated alpha(2u)-globulin nephropathy. a male rat-specific toxicity. Although kidney weight was also increased in females dosed at 500 mg/kg/d. it was not considered to be an adverse effect because there were no histopathological changes. Pup weights on postnatal day 0 were decreased at 500 mg/kg/d and still decreased on postnatal day 4. Our data indicated the no-observed-adverse-effect-level for repeated-dose and reproductive/developmental toxicity for 1-tert-butoxy-4-chlorobenzene was 100 mg/kg/d....,Psychology,biochemistry,Depression,Molecular biology
17,The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) plays a mandatory role in the action of most opioid drugs. such as morphine. fentanyl. and heroin. it has been revealed that a deficiency in the MOR gene (Oprm 1) or a difference in the 3' noncoding region of the gene markedly affects the sensitivity of mice to opioids. As the 3' noncoding region of the human OPRM1 gene had not yet been characterized. in the present study we conducted 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3'RACE)-PCR and identified the 3' end of the human MOR-1 mRNA. the most abundant transcript among OPRM1 gene transcripts. The poly(A) signal was located at 13612-13617 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon in the OPRM1 gene. Reverse transcription PCR analyses showed that the region from the stop codon to the poly(A) signal was transcribed. In the 3' UTR. we identified 33 AU-rich regions and more than 300 putative transcription factor-binding sites. Furthermore. we compared the 3' noncoding regions of the human and mouse OPRM1/Oprm1] genes and found apparent homology. In Northern blotting with mouse brain mRNAs. a same-size band was detected by a probe for the MOR-1 coding region and by a probe for a mouse genome region corresponding to the human MOR-1 3'UTR. Since 3'UTRs affect gene expression. the present characterization of the 3' noncoding region in the human OPRM1 gene should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying OPRM1 gene regulation and individual differences in sensitivity to opioids.

19,3D printing has shown promise for neural regeneration by providing customized nerve scaffolds to structurally support and bridge the defect gap as well as deliver cells or various bioactive substances. Low-level light therapy (LLLT) exhibits positive effects on rehabiliation of degenerative nerves and neural disorders. With this in mind. we postulate that 3D printed neural scaffold coupling with LLLT will generate a new strategy to repair neural degeneration. To achieve this goal. we applied red laser light to stimualte neural stem cells on 3D printed scaffolds and investigated the subsequent cell response with respect to cell proliferation and differentiation. Here we show that cell prolifeartion rate and intracellular reactive oxgen species synthesis were significantly increased after 15 s laser stimulation follwed by 1 d culture. Over culturing time of 14 d in vitro. the laser stimulation promoted neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells. while the glial differentiation was suppressed based on results of both immunocytochemistry studies and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. These findings suggest that integration of 3D printing and LLLT might provide a powerful methodology for neural tissue engineering....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Parkinson's Disease
20,With the advances of stem cell research. development of intelligent biomaterials and three-dimensional biofabrication strategies. highly mimicked tissue or organs can be engineered. Among all the biofabrication approaches. bioprinting based on inkjet printing technology has the promises to deliver and create biomimicked tissue with high throughput. digital control. and the capacity of single cell manipulation. Therefore. this enabling technology has great potential in regenerative medicine and translational applications. The most current advances in organ and tissue bioprinting based on the thermal inkjet printing technology are described in this review. including vasculature. muscle. cartilage. and bone. In addition. the benign side effect of bioprinting to the printed mammalian cells can be utilized for gene or drug delivery. which can be achieved conveniently during precise cell placement for tissue construction. With layer-by-layer assembly. three-dimensional tissues with complex structures can be printed using converted medical images. Therefore. bioprinting based on thermal inkjet is so far the most optimal solution to engineer vascular system to the thick and complex tissues. Collectively. bioprinting has great potential and broad applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The future advances of bioprinting include the integration of different printing mechanisms to engineer biphasic or triphasic tissues with optimized scaffolds and further understanding of stem cell biology....,ECE,Medical,Digital control,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
21,3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) was a novel hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-synthesizing enzyme that may be involved in cyanide degradation and in thiosulfate biosynthesis. Over recent years. considerable attention has been focused on the biochemistry and molecular biology of H2S-synthesizing enzyme. In contrast. there have been few concerted attempts to investigate the changes in the expression of the H2S-synthesizing enzymes with disease states. To investigate the changes of 3-MST after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its possible role. mice TBI model was established by controlled cortical impact system. and the expression and cellular localization of 3-MST after TBI was investigated in the present study. Western blot analysis revealed that 3-MST was present in normal mice brain cortex. It gradually increased. reached a peak on the first day after TBI. and then reached a valley on the third day. Importantly. 3-MST was colocalized with neuron. In addition. Western blot detection showed that the first day post injury was also the autophagic peak indicated by the elevated expression of LC3. Importantly. immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that injury-induced expression of 3-MST was partly colabeled by LC3. However. there was no colocalization of 3-MST with propidium iodide (cell death marker) and LC3 positive cells were partly colocalized with propidium iodide. These data suggested that 3-MST was mainly located in living neurons and may be implicated in the autophagy of neuron and involved in the pathophysiology of brain after TBI....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Human Metabolism
22,Oxidative stress is closely involved in neurodegenerative diseases. The present study aimed to examine the effect of anti-oxidant DHM (dihydromyricetin) on 3NP (3-nitropropionic acid) -induced behavioral deficits of experimental rats and striatal histopathological injury by using behavioral. imaging. biochemistry. histochemistry and molecular biology technologies. The experimental results showed that both motor dysfunctions and learning and memory impairments induced by 3NP were significantly reduced after DHM treatment. 3NP-induced striatal metabolic abnormality was also remarkably improved by DHM treatment. showed as the increased glucose metabolism in PET/CT scan. decreased MDA (malondialdehyde) and increased SOD (superoxide dismutase) activity in enzyme histochemical staining. In addition. the cell apoptosis was evidently detected in the striatum of the 3NP group. while in the 3NP + DHM group. the number of apoptotic cells was remarkably reduced. 3NP treatment obviously induced down-regulation of Bcl-2. and up-regulations of Bax and Cleaved Caspase-3. while these changes were significantly reversed by DHM treatment. The present results suggested that DHM showed its protective effect by anti-oxidant and anti-apoptosis mechanisms....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Parkinson's Disease
23,The 45 degrees beam splitting mirror plays a vital role on image quality in the Holographic system. in order to study the influence of environment temperature variation on the 45 degrees beam splitting mirror in the Holographic system. finite element analysis method is used to simulate the anti-three through seven mirror deformation at 27 degrees C. 28 degrees C and 29 degrees C temperature in theory. A new real-time monitoring and displaying photoelectric system for ambient temperature and beam splitting mirror distortion detection is designed to provide real-time temperature change and deformation detection. which is made up of laser speckle interferometer. chip temperature sensor. two-operational amplifier. MCU and LED indicator. And the out-plane displacement value measured in the experiment under the condition of temperature correspondingly are 406nm. 420nm and 427 nm.

24,A thermotolerant bacterium Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus with an ability to produce extracellular -mannanase was isolated from a soil sample. Bacterium produced 45U/mL -mannanase at 50 degrees C. The culture conditions for high-level production of -mannanase were optimized. Optimized MS medium [wheat bran 2% (w/v). ammonium sulfate 0.3% (w/v). yeast extract. and peptone (0.025% each) pH 6.5] was inoculated with 2% of 16H old culture. The culture was incubated at 50 degrees C for 48H resulting in 24-folds higher -mannanase production (1.100 +/- 50U/mL). Optimum pH and temperature for enzyme activity of the crude enzyme was 6.0 and 60 degrees C. respectively. The enzyme demonstrated 65% relative enzyme activity at 37 degrees C. The hydrolytic activity of the crude enzymatic preparation was assessed on various agro residues. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis showed that the enzyme activity to saccharify heteromannans resulted in production of a mixture of manno-oligosaccharides (MOS) and enzyme exhibited classic endo-activity. To evaluate the possible prebiotic potential of the MOS thus obtained. initial screening for their ability to support the growth of probiotics was carried out by the pure culture method. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus sp. responded positively to the addition of enzymatically derived oligosaccharides and their numbers increased significantly.

25,Serotonin N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (SHT) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of feruloylserotonin (FS) and 4-coumaroylserotonin (CS). These serotonin derivatives show strong antioxidant activity. making them valuable for both nutritional and pharmacological use in humans. Ectopic expression of SHT under the control of the endosperm specific-glutelin and prolamin promoters from rice was produced via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. SHT expression was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. followed by Northern blotting and SHT enzyme activity analyses using total RNA and protein. respectively. extracted from transgenic seeds. The glutelin A3 (GluA3) promoter produced low SHT mRNA expression in rice seeds. whereas the prolamin promoter expressed high levels of SHT mRNA. In spite of the ectopic expression of SHT in rice seeds. both transgenic genotypes accumulated levels of serotonin derivatives similar to those found in wild-type rice. Furthermore. our data suggest that serotonin. rather than phenylpropanid-CoAs. is the rate-limiting substrate in the biosynthesis of serotonin derivatives in SHT-overexpressing transgenic rice seeds....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Enzymology
26,A compact. low-noise and inexpensive preamplifier circuit has been designed and fabricated to optimally readout a common cathode (1 x 16) channel 4H-SiC Schottky photodiode array for use in ultraviolet experiments. The readout uses an operational amplifier with 10 pF capacitor in the feedback loop in parallel with a low leakage switch for each of the channels. This circuit configuration allows for reiterative sample. integrate and reset. A sampling technique is given to remove Johnson noise. enabling a femtoampere level readout noise performance. Commercial-off-the-shelf acquisition electronics are used to digitize the preamplifier analog signals. The data logging acquisition electronics has a different integration circuit. which allows the bandwidth and gain to be independently adjusted. Using this readout. photoresponse measurements across the array between spectral wavelengths 200 nm and 370 nm are made to establish the array pixels external quantum efficiency. current responsivity and noise equivalent power.

27,Silicon RF power amplifiers (PAs) are in various RF front end modules (FEMs) today for handset and WLAN applications. Even though III-V semiconductor-based RF PAs can still offer superior frequency and breakdown performance with higher POUT and power-added-efficiency (PAE) and faster time-to-market. silicon-based RF PAs do have the advantages in offering higher monolithic integration with added functionalities (e.g.. on-chip digital control and selection on power level. modulation. frequency band. matching. predistortion. etc.). which can translate to lower cost and smaller sizes attractive for broadband multi-mode multi-band handset transmitters. Therefore. some key techniques for designing high-efficiency 4G/5G/WLAN broadband wireless silicon PAs will be discussed....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Analog signal processing
28,Although gain of chromosome 5p is one of the most frequent DNA copy-number imbalances in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). the genes that drive its selection remain poorly understood. In a previous cross-sectional clinical study. we showed that the microRNA processor Drosha (located on chromosome 5p) demonstrates frequent copy-number gain and overexpression in cervical SCC. associated with altered microRNA profiles. Here. we have conducted gene depletion/overexpression experiments to demonstrate the functional significance of up-regulated Drosha in cervical SCC cells. Drosha depletion by RNA interference (RNAi) produced significant. specific reductions in cell motility/invasiveness in vitro. with a silent RNAi-resistant Drosha mutation providing phenotype rescue. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering following global profiling of 319 microRNAs in 18 cervical SCC cell line specimens generated two groups according to Drosha expression levels. Altering Drosha levels in individual SCC lines changed the group into which the cells clustered. with gene depletion effects being rescued by the RNAi-resistant mutation. Forty-five microRNAs showed significant differential expression between the groups. including four of 14 that were differentially expressed in association with Drosha levels in clinical samples. miR-31 up-regulation in Drosha-overexpressing samples/cell lines was the highest-ranked change (by adjusted p value) in both analyses. an observation validated by northern blotting. These functional data support the role of Drosha as an oncogene in cervical SCC. by affecting expression of cancer-associated microRNAs that have the potential to regulate numerous protein-coding genes.

29,Aim: An RNA-seq analysis recently identified a 236-nucleotide transcript upstream from malS in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. Here. we investigated its molecular characteristics and function. Materials & methods: RACE and northern blotting were used to determine the molecular characteristics of the sequence. and mutagenesis. microarray. immunoblotting and an invasion assay were used to investigate the functions of the transcript. Results: The transcript was identified as the malS 5'-untranslated region (UTR). which could influence the expression of the flagellar and SPI-1 genes and the invasion of HeLa cells by S. Typhi. Deletion of bax increased the expression of the invasion genes and the invasive capacity of S. Typhi. whereas the expression of the malS 5'-UTR reduced the expression of bax. Conclusion: The malS 5'-UTR reduces the expression of bax and increases the invasive capacity of S. Typhi....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,DNA/RNA sequencing
30,This paper presents the design of a compact 60-GHz phase shifter that provides a 5-bit digital phase control and 360 degrees phase range for beam-forming systems. The phase shifter is designed using the proposed cross-coupled bridged T-type topology and switched-varactor reflective-type topology. The topologies are analyzed using a small-signal equivalent circuit model. Furthermore. the design equations are derived and investigated. To validate the theoretical analysis. 60-GHz 5-bit 360 degrees phase shifters are designed in a commercial 65-nm CMOS technology. The fabricated 360 degrees phase shifter features good performance of 32 phase states from 57 to 64 GHz with an rms phase error of 4.4 degrees. a total insertion loss of 14.3 +/- 2 dB. an rms gain error of 0.5 dB. P-1 dB of better than 9.5 dBm. and the power consumption of almost zero. To the best of our knowledge. the designed 360 degrees phase shifter with the size of 0.094 mm(2) is the smallest 5-bit passive phase shifter at frequencies around 60 GHz....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
31,By differential high-throughput RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) we have identified "product RNAs" (pRNAs) as short as 8-12 nucleotides that are synthesized by Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase (RNAP) in vivo using the regulatory 6S-1 RNA as template. The dRNA-seq data were confirmed by in vitro transcription experiments and northern blotting. In our libraries. we were unable to detect statistically meaningful numbers of reads potentially representing pRNAs derived from 6S-2 RNA. However. pRNAs could be synthesized in vitro from 6S-2 RNA as template by the B. subtilis sigma(A) RNAP. 6S-1 pRNA levels are low during exponential. increase in stationary and burst during outgrowth from stationary phase. demonstrating that pRNA synthesis is a conserved regulatory mechanism. but a more dynamic and fine-tuning process than previously thought. Most pRNAs have a length of 8-15 nt. very few up to 24 nt. The average length of pRNAs tended to increase from stationary to outgrowth conditions. Synthesis of pRNA is initiated at C40 of 6S-1 RNA and U41 of 6S-2 RNA. yielding pRNAs with a 5'-terminal G or A residue. respectively. A B. subtilis 6S-1 RNA mutant strain encoding a pRNA with a 5'-terminal A residue showed the same relative distribution of similar to 14-nt pRNAs between the different growth states. but generally displayed lower pRNA levels than the reference strain encoding wild-type 6S-1 RNA. A similar to two-fold lower affinity of the C40U mutant 6S-1 RNA towards sigma(A) RNAP may have contributed to this reduction in pRNA levels. We infer that 6S-1 pRNA synthesis. although evolutionarily optimized for initiation with a + 1G residue. is not primarily regulated at the transcription initiation level via growth phase-dependent variations in the cellular GTP pool....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,DNA/RNA sequencing
32,The "central dogma" of molecular biology describes how information contained in DNA is transformed into RNA and finally into proteins. In order for proteins to maintain their functionality in both the parent cell and subsequent generations. it is essential that the information encoded in DNA and RNA remains unaltered. DNA and RNA are constantly exposed to damaging agents. which can modify nucleic acids and change the information they encode. While much is known about how cells respond to damaged DNA. the importance of protecting RNA has only become appreciated over the past decade. Modification of the nucleobase through oxidation and alkylation has long been known to affect its base-pairing properties during DNA replication. Similarly. recent studies have begun to highlight some of the unwanted consequences of chemical damage on mRNA decoding during translation. Oxidation and alkylation of mRNA appear to have drastic effects on the speed and fidelity of protein synthesis. As some mRNAs can persist for days in certain tissues. it is not surprising that it has recently emerged that mRNA-surveillance and RNA-repair pathways have evolved to clear or correct damaged mRNA....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Molecular biology
33,A cDNA clone of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. encoding auxin binding protein 1 (ABP1). one of the putative receptors of auxin. was isolated. and the seasonal expression of ABP1 in relation to IAA and ABA annual variation was investigated by different technical approaches including RT-PCR. real-time PCR. northern blotting. western blotting. and immunolocalization. In the cambial region. ABP1 expression at both the protein and the mRNA level was found to be high. low. and remarkably scarce in the active. quiescent. and resting stages. respectively. during cambium periodicity. The signal abundance of ABP1 follows the opposite pattern to ABA accumulation and correlates with auxin responsiveness of the cambial tissues. suggesting a role for ABP1 in mediating auxin-dependent regulation of cambial activation in the activity-dormancy cycle. This paper attempts to explain why IAA would 'boost' the reactivation of a quiescent cambium. and not that of a resting cambium. Results also show that ABP1 expression is improved by IAA. while inhibited by ABA....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Cell biology
34,The monkey is an important experimental model in the pharmacological evaluation of new drugs. We isolated monkey multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) cDNA to examine expression profiles among various tissues and measured ATPase activity to assess substrate specificity. The amino acid sequence encoded by monkey MRP2 cDNA was very similar (96% identity) to the reported human MRP2 cDNA (GenBank accession no. NM_000392). The tissue distribution of MRP2 in monkeys was partially different from that in humans. We found relatively high expression of MRP2 in the monkey kidney and small intestine using Northern blotting. Substrate specificity was compared between human and monkey MRP2. The affinity of 17 beta-estradiol 17-(beta-D-glucuronide). methotrexate. vinblastine. and probenecid to monkey MRP2 was higher than that to human MRP2. Functional and expression differences between human and monkey MRP2 should be incorporated into the evaluation of candidate drugs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

35,Introduction: Most disseminated cancers remain fatal despite the availability of a variety of conventional and novel treatments including surgery. chemotherapy. radiotherapy. immunotherapy. and biologically targeted therapy. A major factor responsible for the failure of chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer is the development of multidrug resistance (MDR). The overexpression of various ABC transporters in cancer cells can efficiently remove the anticancer drug from the cell. thus causing the drug to lose its effect.Areas covered: In this review. we summarised the ongoing research related to the mechanism. function. and regulation of ABC transporters. We integrated our current knowledge at different levels from molecular biology to clinical trials. We also discussed potential therapeutic strategies of targeting ABC transporters to reverse MDR in cancer cells.Expert opinion: Involvement of various ABC transporters to cancer MDR lays the foundation for developing tailored therapies that can overcome MDR. An ideal MDR reversal agent should have broad-spectrum ABC-transporter inhibitory activity. be potent. have good pharmacokinetics. have no trans-stimulation effects. and have low or no toxicity. Alternatively. nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems containing both the cytotoxic drug and reversing agent may represent a useful approach to reversing MDR with minimal off-target toxicity....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
36,PurposeDespite being the third most common ABCA4 variant observed in patients with Stargardt disease. the functional effect of the intronic ABCA4 variant c.5461-10T>C is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular effect of this variant. MethodsFibroblast samples from patients carrying the ABCA4 variant c.5461-10T>C were analysed by isolating total RNA. followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using specific primers spanning the variant. For detection of ABCA4 protein. fibroblast samples were lysed and analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using a monoclonal ABCA4 antibody. ResultsThe ABCA4 variant c.5461-10T>C causes a splicing defect resulting in the reduction of full-length mRNA in fibroblasts from patients and the presence of alternatively spliced mRNAs where exon 39-40 is skipped. A reduced level of full-length ABCA4 protein is observed compared to controls not carrying the variant. ConclusionsThis study describes the functional effect and the molecular mechanism of the pathogenic ABCA4 variant c.5461-10T>C. The variant is functionally important as it leads to splicing defects and a reduced level of ABCA4 protein....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
37,Objective/Background: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have already been identified as key players in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However. the current data remain inconclusive. In this study. the expression of MMPs at mRNA and protein levels were investigated in relation to the degradation of collagen I and collagen III. Methods: Tissue samples were obtained from 40 patients with AAA undergoing open aortic repair. and from five healthy controls during kidney transplantation. Expression of MMPs 1. 2. 3. 7. 8. 9. and 12. and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)1. and TIMP2 were measured at the mRNA level using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. At the protein level. MMPs. collagen I. and collagen III. and their degradation products carboxy-terminal collagen cross-links (CTX)-I and CTX-III. were quantified via enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. In addition. immunohistochemistry and gelatine zymography were performed. Results: In AAA. significantly enhanced mRNA expression was observed for MMPs 3. 9. and 12 compared with controls (p <= .001). MMPs 3. 9. and 12 correlated significantly with macrophages (p = .007. p = .018. and p = .015. respectively). and synthetic smooth muscle cells with MMPs 1. 2. and 9 (p = .020. p = .018. and p = .027. respectively). At the protein level. MMPs 8. 9. and 12 were significantly elevated in AAA (p = .006. p = .0004. and p < .001. respectively). No significant correlation between mRNA and protein was observed for any MMP. AAA contained significantly reduced intact collagen I (twofold; p = .002). whereas collagen III was increased (4.6 fold; p < .001). Regarding degraded collagen I and III relative to intact collagens. observations were inverse (1.4 fold increase for CTX-1 [p < .001]; fivefold decrease for CTX-III [p = .004]). MMPs 8. 9. and 12 correlated with collagen I (p = .019. p < .001. and p = 0.003. respectively). collagen III (p = .015. p < .001. and p < .001. respectively). and degraded collagen I (p = .012. p = .049. and p = .001. respectively). Conclusion: No significant relationship was found between mRNA and protein and MMP levels. MMPs 9 and 12 were overexpressed in AAA at the mRNA and protein level. and MMP-8 at the protein level. MMP-2 was detected in synthetic SMCs. Collagen I and III showed inverse behaviour in AAA. In particular. MMPs 8. 9. and;12 appear to be associated with collagen I. collagen III. and their degradation products. (C) 2017 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

38,Purpose of review One of the most important challenges in the intestinal ( ITx) and multivisceral transplant ( MVTx) is to achieve a successful abdominal wall closure. Recent findings A tension-free primary closure should be our aim. In most of the cases. we need to perform a component separation technique. alone or combined. to the use of a synthetic mesh. If those options are not feasible. the abdominal wall composite vascularized allograft transplant ( AW-CVA) utilizing direct orthotopic vascularization can be considered. The nonvascularized abdominal rectus fascia has also become an alternative method used worldwide. proving to be simple and well tolerated procedure. Furthermore. the use of the AW has been recently proposed as a new tool for a sentinel monitoring of the intestinal or pancreas allograft. Summary There are different validated options for abdominal wall closure following intestinal transplantation. The long-term benefits of transplanting the abdominal wall. full or partial thickness and vascularized or nonvascularised. were shown. New developments might help to expand their applications in different areas such as reconstructive surgery and immunology....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Digestive Health
39,The Arabidopsis thaliana late embryogenesis abundant gene AtEm6 is required for normal seed development and for buffering the rate of dehydration during the latter stages of seed maturation. However. its function in salt stress tolerance is not fully understood. In this investigation. cell suspension cultures of three plant species rice (Oryza sativa L.). cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). and white pine (Pinus strobes L.) were transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 harboring pBI-AtEm6. Integration of the AtEm6 gene into the genome of rice. cotton. and white pine has been confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Southern blotting. and northern blotting analyses. Three transgenic cell lines from each of O. sativa. G. hirsutum. and P. strobus were used to analyze salt stress tolerance conferred by the overexpression of the AtEm6 gene. Our results demonstrated that expression of the AtEm6 gene enhanced salt tolerance in transgenic cell lines. A decrease in lipid peroxidation and an increment in antioxidant enzymes ascorbate peroxidase. glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase activities were observed in the transgenic cell lines. compared to the non- transgenic control. In rice. AtEM6 increased expression of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase genes OsCPK6. OsCPK9. OsCPK10. OsCPK19. OsCPK25. and OsCPK26 under treatment of salt. These results suggested that overexpression of the AtEM6 gene in transgenic cell lines improved salt stress tolerance by regulating expression of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase genes. Overexpression of the AtEM6 gene could be an alternative choice for engineering plant abiotic stress tolerance....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
40,A novel gene. named NgAOX1a. was isolated from Nicotiana glutinosa by RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR). The full-length cDNA of NgAOX1a was 1448 bp. including a 1062-bp ORF (open reading frame). a 124 bp 5' UTR (untranslated region) and a 262 bp 3' UTR. The ORF encodes a 353-amino-acid protein which contains two conserved cysteine residues. four iron-binding motifs. five alpha-helix regions and six conserved histidine residues. The phylogenetic tree showed that NgAOX1a belongs to the AQX1 (alternative oxidase 1)-type group. Alignment analysis showed that NgAOX1a shares a high similarity with other known AOXs. Four exons and three introns were detected in the genomic DNA sequence. and Southern-blotting analysis suggested that NgAOX1a is a single-copy gene. A series of putative cis-acting elements were examined in the 5'-flanking region of NgAOX1a. Northern-blotting analysis showed that the transcript levels of NgAOX1a can be markedly accumulated when tobacco seedlings are treated with various abiotic stimuli. such as exogenous signalling molecules for plant defence response. salicylic acid and H2O2. and the exogenous TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle metabolite citrate. However. it could be suppressed by abiotic stress. such as CoCl2. an inhibitor of ethylene. which indicates that the expression of NgAOX1a may be regulated by ethylene. In addition. NgAOX1a can also be strongly induced by three viral pathogens. tobacco mosaic virus. potato virus X and potato virus Y. These results indicate that NgAOX1a may be involved in multi-signal transduction pathways and may play an important role in defence response....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
41,To identify genes expression in Chenopodium album exposed to NaCl stress and screen ESTs related to salt stress. a subtractive suppression hybridization (SSH) library of C. album under salt stress was constructed in the present study. Random EST sequencing produced 825 high-quality ESTs with GenBank ID GE746311-GE747007. which had 301 bp of average size and were clustered into 88 contigs and 550 singletons. They were classified into 12 categories according to their function annotations. 635 ESTs (76.97%) showed similarities to gene sequences in the non-redundancy database. while 190 ESTs (23.03%) showed low or no similarities. The transcriptional profiles of 56 ESTs randomly selected from 347 unknown or novel ESTs of SSH library under varying NaCl concentration and at different time points were analyzed. The results indicated that a high proportion of tested ESTs were activated by salt stress. Four in 56 ESTs responded to NaCl were also enhanced in expression level when exposed to ABA and PEG stresses. The above four ESTs were validated by northern blotting which was consistent with the results of RT-PCR. The results suggested that genes corresponded to these ESTs might be involved in stress response or regulation. The complete sequences and detailed function of these ESTs need to be further studied....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,DNA/RNA sequencing
42,Phosphorylation of protein kinases has profound effects on their activity and interaction with other proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation was reported to be involved in various physiological processes in plants; however. no typical receptor tyrosine kinase has been isolated from plants thus far. Dual-specificity kinases are potentially responsible for the phosphorylation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine of target proteins. A cDNA clone encoding a putative dual-specificity protein kinase was isolated by screening the cDNA GAL4 activation domain (AD) fusion library of soybean (Glycine max L.). and its entire length was obtained using 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The predicted polypeptide of 330 amino acid residues. designated as GmSTY1. contains all 11 conserved subdomains. which share common characteristics with both the serine/ threonine and tyrosine protein kinases reported thus far. In addition. three potential N-linked glycosylation sites (NXS/T). as well as phosphorylation motifs (SXXXS/T). were observed. suggesting that GmSTY1 may be post-translationally modified. Furthermore. a potential N-myristoylation motif (MGARCSK) was found. suggesting that the GmSTY1 protein could associate with membranes in vivo. Southern blotting analysis revealed a single-copy of GmSTY1 in the genome. Northern blotting analysis showed that this gene was upregulated by drought and salt treatment in a time-dependent manner; however. exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) could not significantly affect the mRNA accumulation of GmSTY1. Interestingly. the transcript of this gene was remarkably downregulated by cold treatment during the early stages of the response. but upregulated later. These results indicate that the protein kinase was possibly regulated by abiotic stresses in an ABA-independent pathway....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
43,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are signalling modules that transduce extracellular signalling to a range of cellular responses. Plant MAPK cascades have been implicated in development and stress response. In this study. we isolated a novel group C MAPKK gene. ZmMKK4. from maize. Northern blotting analysis revealed that the ZmMKK4 transcript expression was up-regulated by cold. high salt and exogenous H(2)O(2). but down-regulated by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). Over-expression of ZmMKK4 in Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to cold and salt stresses by increased germination rate. lateral root numbers. plant survival rate. chlorophyll. proline and soluble sugar contents. and antioxidant enzyme [peroxidase (POD). catalase (CAT)] activities compared with control plants. Furthermore. ZmMKK4 enhanced a 37 kDa kinase activity after cold and salt stresses. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the transcript levels of stress-responsive transcription factors and functional genes were higher in ZmMKK4-over-expressing plants than in control plants. In addition. ZmMKK4 protein is localized in the nucleus. Taken together. these results indicate that ZmMKK4 is a positive regulator of salt and cold tolerance in plants....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology

C. colosynthis is resistant to high temperatures and grows in the desert regions of North Africa. the Middle East and Western Asia. C. colocynthis likely carries genes of interest that could be explored for inducing abiotic stress resistance in transgenic plants. Although the tissue culture and molecular biology of this species have been explored. the latter has been primarily used to resolve taxonomic relationships with other members of the Citrullus genus and curcubits. Genetic mining of the plant is scarce while genetic transformation protocols are also rare.

45,Purpose of review This review provides an update and summary of recent neuropsychological findings in epilepsy focusing on three major clinical topics among the many developments in the field. We will critically outline the current state with regard to cognition in new-onset epilepsies. social cognition in epilepsy. and the long-term outcome of epilepsy surgery and the cognitive outcomes of superselective surgical procedures. Recent findings Current studies indicate that neuropsychological impairments are prevalent already at the onset of epilepsy and even before. social cognition (i.e.. emotion recognition and theory of mind) is impaired in different epilepsy populations. the long-term outcome of epilepsy surgery is mostly characterized by a stable or even improved cognitive status. and superselective epilepsy surgeries are associated with a promising neuropsychological outcome. Summary The high prevalence of cognitive deficits around epilepsy onset challenges the assumption that epilepsy is the major cause of cognitive problems and calls for early neuropsychological diagnostics. Social cognition seems to be a relevant domain that is not yet routinely considered in epilepsy. The cognitive long-term outcome of epilepsy surgery is mostly positive. Stereotactic thermocoagulation and gamma knife surgery appear to be cognitively safe procedures....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Schizophrenia
46,microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in tissue development and the pathology of many diseases. however. the effects and roles of miRNAs in the development of semen abnormalities in infertile males have not yet been investigated. In this study. we analyzed and compared the miRNA expression profiles of abnormal semen from 86 infertile males with normal semen from 86 healthy males using an miRNA microarray. In total. 52 miRNAs were differentially expressed between the abnormal semen of infertile males and the normal semen of healthy males. The differential expression of selected miRNAs was validated by real time qRT-PCR and northern blotting: miR-574-5p. miR-297. miR-122. miR-1275. miR-373. miR-185 and miR-193b were upregulated (fold change >1.5. p<0.001) and miR-100. miR-512-3p. miR-16. miR-19b. miR-23b and miR-26a were downregulated (fold change <0.667. p<0.001) in the semen of infertile males with semen abnormalities.

47,Background: Respiratory morbidity in Australian Indigenous children is higher than their non-Indigenous counterparts. irrespective of urban or remote residence. There are limited studies addressing acute respiratory illness (ARI) in urban Indigenous children. particularly those that address the upper airway microbiome and its relationship to disease. We aimed to describe the prevalence of upper airway viruses and bacteria in symptomatic and asymptomatic urban-based Australian Indigenous children aged less than 5 years. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of data collected at baseline in an ongoing prospective cohort study of urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children registered with a primary health care service in the northern suburbs of Brisbane. Australia. Clinical. demographic and epidemiological data and bilateral anterior nasal swabs were collected on enrolment. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasal swabs to detect 17 respiratory viruses and 7 bacteria. The primary outcome was the prevalence of these microbes at enrolment. Logistic regression was performed to investigate differences in microbe prevalence between children with and without acute respiratory illness with cough as a symptom (ARIwC) at time of specimen collection. Results: Between February 2013 and October 2015. 164 children were enrolled. The median age at enrolment was 18. 0 months (IQR 7.2-34.3). 49.4% were boys and 56 children (34.2%) had ARIwC. Overall. 133/164 (81%) nasal swabs were positive for at least one organism; 131 (79.9%) for any bacteria. 59 (36.2%) for any virus and 57 (34.8%) for both viruses and bacteria. Co-detection of viruses and bacteria was more common in females than males (61.4% vs 38.6%. p = 0.044). No microbes. alone or in combination. were significantly associated with the presence of ARIwC. Conclusions: The prevalence of upper airways microbes in asymptomatic children is similar to non-Indigenous children with ARIwC from the same region. Determining the aetiology of ARIwC in this community is complicated by the high prevalence of multiple respiratory pathogens in the upper airways....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Children's Health
48,We identified a Nodulin-related protein 1 (NRP1) encoded by At2g03440. which was previously reported to be RPS2 interacting protein in yeast-two-hybrid assay. Northern blotting showed that AtNRP1 expression was suppressed by heat stress (42A degrees C) and induced by low temperature (4A degrees C) treatment. Strong GUS staining was observed in the sites of meristematic tissues of pAtNRP1:: GUS transgenic plants. such as shoot apex and root tips. young leaf veins. stamens and stigmas of flowers. and abscission layers of young siliques. To study AtNRP1 biological functions. we have characterized both loss-of-function T-DNA insertion and transgenic overexpression plants for AtNRP1 in Arabidopsis. The T-DNA insertion mutants displayed no obvious difference as compared to wild-type Arabidopsis under heat stress. but the significant enhanced susceptibility to heat stress was revealed in two independent AtNRP1-overexpressing transgenic lines. Further study found that the decreased thermtolerance in AtNRP1-overexpressing lines accompanied significantly decreased accumulation of ABA after heat treatment. which was probably due to AtNRP1 playing a role in negative-feedback regulation of the ABA synthesis pathway. These results support the viewpoint that the application of ABA inhibits nodulation and nodulin-related gene expression and threaten adverse ambient temperature can impact the nodulin-related gene expression....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Northern blotting
49,Although a great deal of progress has been made toward understanding the role of abscisic acid (ABA) in fruit ripening. many components in the ABA signalling pathway remain to be elucidated. Here. a strawberry gene homologous to the Arabidopsis gene ABI1. named FaABI1. was isolated and characterized. The 1641bp cDNA includes an intact open reading frame that encodes a deduced protein of 546 amino acids. in which putative conserved domains were determined by homology analysis. Transcriptional analysis showed that the levels of FaABI1 mRNA expression declined rapidly during strawberry fruit development as evidenced by real-time PCR. semi-quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR. and northern blotting analyses. suggesting that the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase PP2C1 encoded by FaABI1 may be involved in fruit ripening as a negative regulator. The results of Tobacco rattle virus-induced gene silencing and PBI121 vector-mediated overexpression suggested that the down- and up-regulation of FaABI1 mRNA expression levels in degreening strawberry fruit could promote and inhibit ripening. respectively. Furthermore. alteration of FaABI1 expression could differentially regulate the transcripts of a set of both ABA-responsive and ripening-related genes. including ABI3. ABI4. ABI5. SnRK2. ABRE1. CHS. PG1. PL. CHI. F3H. DFR. ANS. and UFGT. Taken together. the data provide new evidence for an important role for ABA in regulating strawberry fruit ripening in the processes of which the type 2C protein phosphatase ABI1 serves as a negative regulator. Finally. a possible core mechanism underlying ABA perception and signalling transduction in strawberry fruit ripening is discussed....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
50,In this paper. the concept of multi-objective optimization is introduced in the automation of the placement task in analog integrated circuits layout design. To bridge the difficulties found on state-of-the-art works on fulfilling proximity constraints. here. cells are organized into proximity groups which implement the desired set of symmetry and proximity requirements. Then. an innovative archived-based multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm. operating over an absolute representation. is proposed to optimize the placement of each proximity group. In contrast to traditional single-objective placement approaches. the resulting Pareto fronts of placements. representing the tradeoffs between the optimization objectives of each group. are combined. bottom-up. through the design hierarchy. until a final front is obtained. This way. the problem's complexity is reduced. and split over multiple executions of the optimization kernel with less design variables. and also. analog designer becomes aware of the design tradeoffs. The proposed multi-objective and hierarchical methodology was implemented. and. experimental results prove that previous efforts on single-objective absolute representations are no match for the obtained floorplans. Furthermore. the obtained Pareto fronts contain the solutions found with the most recent published topological representations for the well-known Microelectronics Center of North Carolina benchmark sets. and. allowed an improvement of placement area up to 23% on a previously optimized folded cascode operational amplifier for the United Microelectronics Corporation 0.13 gm fabrication process.

51,This study examined whether child abuse history in teen mothers impacts offspring externalizing problems indirectly. through its influence on attachment and maternal hostility. In a longitudinal sample of 112 teen mother-child dyads. mothers reported on their own abuse experiences. attachment and maternal hostility were assessed via direct observations. and externalizing problems were measured using maternal reports. Compared with mothers with no abuse history. mothers with a history of sexual and physical abuse were more likely to have an insecurely attached infant. which predicted higher externalizing problems in preschool. which in turn predicted subsequent increases in externalizing problems in Grade 3. Furthermore. relative to the no abuse history group. mothers with a history of sexual and physical abuse showed more hostility toward their child at preschool. which in turn predicted elevated externalizing problems in Grade 3. Mothers' history of either sexual or physical abuse alone did not have significant indirect effects on externalizing problems. Fostering secure attachment and reducing risk for maternal hostility might be important intervention goals for prevention programs involving at-risk mothers with abuse histories.

52,Background This study assessed the knowledge of personal safety skills among children with developmental disabilities and their parents' perceptions of children's knowledge. Method This exploratory study examined the mental health records of 37 children with developmental disabilities referred for an abuse risk reduction group in a community mental health setting. Qualitative analysis of children's responses to questions about personal safety skills (knowledge related to physical development and personal safety. an appropriate and inappropriate touch and safety skills to respond to an inappropriate touch) indicated participants' varied and inconsistent levels of knowledge. Results Consistent with the literature. the results indicate risk factors for sexual abuse among children with developmental disabilities. including children's difficulty distinguishing between an appropriate and inappropriate touch and the lack of knowledge regarding appropriate venues for disclosing an inappropriate touch. Among parents. a lack of certainty regarding their children's knowledge and the ability to keep themselves safe was identified. Conclusion Results support the need for education about personal safety for children with developmental disabilities and their families....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
53,Introduction: Posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS) are associated with increased risk of obstetric complications among pregnant survivors of trauma. abuse and interpersonal violence. but little is known about how PTS affects women's actual experiences of obstetric care. This study investigated the rate at which abuse history was detected by obstetricians. whether abuse survivors experienced more invasive exams than is typically indicated for routine obstetric care. and whether psychological distress was associated with abuse survivors' sense of self-efficacy when communicating their obstetric care needs.Methods: Forty-one pregnant abuse survivors completed questionnaires about abuse history. current psychological distress and self-efficacy for communicating obstetric care needs and preferences. Electronic medical records (EMRs) were reviewed to examine frequency of invasive prenatal obstetric procedures (e.g. removal of clothing for external genital examination. pelvic exams and procedures) and to examine the detection rate of abuse histories during the initial obstetric visit.Results: The majority of participants (83%) reported at least one past incident of violent physical or sexual assault. Obstetricians detected abuse histories in less than one quarter of cases. Nearly half of participants (46%) received invasive exams for non-routine reasons. PTS and depression symptoms were associated with lower self-efficacy in communicating obstetric care preferences.Discussion: Women most at risk for experiencing distress during their obstetric visits and/or undergoing potentially distressing procedures may also be the least likely to communicate their distress to obstetricians. Results are discussed with implications for improving screening for abuse screening and distress symptoms as well as need for trauma-sensitive obstetric practices....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Multiple Sclerosis
54,This paper tests the hypothesis that the association between childhood maltreatment and adult personality dysfunction is at least partially attributable to insecure attachment. that is that attachment style mediates the relationship between childhood maltreatment and adult personality dysfunction. Associations between childhood trauma. as measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). anxious and avoidant attachment in romantic relationships. as measured by the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R). and five personality domains. as measured by the Severity Indices of Personality Problems (SIPP-118). were examined in a sample of 72 psychiatric inpatients. The SIPP-118 domains included relational capacities. identity integration. self-control. responsibility. and social concordance. The direct effect of childhood trauma on all SIPP-118 domains was not significant after controlling for the indirect effect of attachment. In regression modeling. a significant indirect effect of childhood trauma via adult attachment style was found for SIPP-118 relational capacities. identity integration. self-control. and social concordance. Specifically. anxious attachment was a significant mediator of the effect of childhood trauma on self-control. identity integration. and relational domains. These results suggest that childhood trauma impacts a broad range of personality domains and does so in large part through the pathway of anxious romantic attachment style....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
55,Background: Alterations in gray matter development represent a potential pathway through which childhood abuse is associated with psychopathology. Several prior studies find reduced volume and thickness of prefrontal (PFC) and temporal cortex regions in abused compared with nonabused adolescents. although most prior research is based on adults and volume-based measures. This study tests the hypothesis that child abuse. independent of parental education. predicts reduced cortical thickness in prefrontal and temporal cortices as well as reduced gray mater volume (GMV) in subcortical regions during adolescence. Methods: Structural MRI scans were obtained from 21 adolescents exposed to physical and/or sexual abuse and 37 nonabused adolescents (ages 13-20). Abuse was operationalized using dichotomous and continuous measures. We examined associations between abuse and brain structure in several a priori-defined regions. controlling for parental education. age. sex. race. and total brain volume for subcortical GMV. Significance was evaluated at p < .05 with a false discovery rate correction. Results: Child abuse exposure and severity were associated with reduced thickness in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC). right lateral orbitofrontal cortex. right inferior frontal gyrus. bilateral parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). left temporal pole. and bilateral inferior. right middle. and right superior temporal gyri. Neither abuse measure predicted cortical surface area or subcortical GMV. Bilateral PHG thickness was inversely related to externalizing symptoms. Conclusions: Child abuse. an experience characterized by a high degree of threat. is associated with reduced cortical thickness in ventromedial and ventrolateral PFC and medial and lateral temporal cortex in adolescence. Reduced PHG thickness may be a mediator linking abuse with externalizing psychopathology. although prospective research is needed to evaluate this possibility....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse

57,Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a global public health problem with major consequences for the individual child and society. An earlier Swedish study showed that the school nurses did not initially talk about nor mention CSA as one form of child abuse. For the child to receive adequate support. the disclosure is a precondition and is dependent on an available person prepared to listen. The aim of the study was to explore the ability of the school nurses to detect and support sexually abused children. It is a secondary analysis of focus group interviews with school nurses. Thematic analysis was performed. Results showed that the school nurses avoided addressing CSA due to arousal of strong emotions. ambivalence. and a complicated disclosure process. In order to detect CSA and support abused children. attentiveness of sexual abuse as a possible cause of physical and mental illhealth is crucial....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health
58,The current study examined the mediating effects of the teacher and peer relationships between parental abuse/neglect and a child's emotional/behavioral problems. A total of 2070 student surveys from the panel of the Korean Child Youth Panel Study (KCYPS) were analyzed by path analysis. The key findings of this study are outlined below. Firstly. parental physical and emotional abuse and neglect had significant effects on children's problems. The direct effect of parental abuse on emotional/behavioral problems was higher than the direct effect of parental neglect on emotional/behavioral problems. Secondly. the teacher relationship partially mediated the effects of the parental abuse/neglect on emotional/behavioral problems. Thirdly. the peer relationship also partially mediated the effects of parental abuse/neglect on children's emotional/behavioral problems. The indirect effect of parental neglect via teacher relationships and peer relationships was stronger than the indirect effect of parental abuse. This study is significant in that it identified that parental abuse/neglect was mediated by the teacher and peer relationship. thereby suggesting an implication for effective intervention with children who have suffered abuse and neglect. In terms of the teacher and peer relationship. understanding the influence of parental abuse and neglect on children's problems was discussed. and the limitations and recommendations for future study were suggested.

59,Abuse-related trauma remains a global health issue. However. there is paucity in nationwide reports. We aim to estimate the incidence of abuse-related trauma forward medical care and identify its characteristics and clinical course in Taiwan. Patients with trauma between 2005 and 2007 that occurred 3 months before or after a diagnosis of abuse were identified from a randomly sampled nationwide longitudinal health insurance database of 1 million beneficiaries. The patients' demographic data. injury pattern. and medical resource utilization were measured. stratified by age and sex. and compared using chi-square test. Risk factors of next trauma event were identified using Cox regression analysis. Ninety-three patients (65 females) were identified (mean age. 20.6 +/- 16.3 years). including 61.3% under 18 years of age. For the first trauma event. 68 patients (73.1%) visited the emergency room. 63 (67.7%) received intervention. and 14 (15.1%) needed hospital care. Seven (7.5%). all less than 11 years old. had intracranial hemorrhage and required intensive care. Thirty-three (35.5%) left with complications or sequelae. or required rehabilitation. but all survived. Of the 34 victims of sexual abuse. 32 were aged less than 18 years. Men received more mood stabilizers or antipsychotics (50.0% vs 10.7%. P = 0.030) and reeducative psychotherapy (25.0% vs 0. P = 0.044). Risk factors for a next trauma event were injury involving the extremities (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.27 [2.45-11.33]) and use of antibiotics (HR: 4.21 [1.45-12.24]) on the first trauma event. Abuse-related trauma has heterogeneous presentations among subgroups. Clinicians should be alert in providing timely diagnosis and individualized intervention....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health
60,Purpose of review This review addresses some of the more salient articles in the field of child maltreatment published in 2015. with a goal of helping the general practitioner understand the evolution of research in the field of child abuse pediatrics (a board-certified specialty since 2009). Recent findings Researchers continue to refine the database for child abuse pediatrics. Several articles focus on the inconsistencies in approach to the evaluation of possible physical child abuse between hospitals and practitioners. Multiple researchers aim to develop a protocol that standardizes the response to findings of a sentinel injury. such as a rib fracture. abdominal trauma. or unexplained bruising in a nonambulatory infant. Professionals are also working to improve our understanding about the impact of trauma on children and how best to ameliorate its effects. Summary With solid. evidence-based literature published on various topics in the field of child abuse pediatrics. experts work to refine and unify the clinician's approach to the evaluation of possible physical abuse....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health

62,The frequency and severity of physical abuse influences children's outcomes. yet little theory-based research has explored what predicts its course. This study examined the potential role of social information processing (SIP) factors in the course of abuse. Mothers with histories of perpetrating physical abuse (N = 62) completed measures of SIP. and the frequency and severity of mother-perpetrated physical abuse were collected from Child Protection Services records. Poorer problem-solving capacities were significantly related to greater frequency of physical abuse. Hostile attributions toward children were positively associated with abuse severity. Controlling for demographics and co-occurrence of neglect. SIP factors together accounted for a significant proportion of variance in the frequency of physical abuse. but not severity. With the exception of unrealistic expectations. preliminary evidence supported a link between maternal SIP and the course of abuse perpetration. Future research directions and implications for intervention are discussed....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
63,Shaken baby syndrome is a term often used by the physicians and public to describe abusive trauma inflicted on infants and young children. Advances in the understanding of the mechanisms and the associated clinical spectrum of injury has lead us to modify our terminology and address it as "abusive trauma" (AT). Pediatric abusive head trauma is defined as an injury to the skull or intracranial contents of an infant or a young child (<5 y age) due to inflicted blunt impact and/or violent shaking. This chapter focuses on the imaging aspects of childhood abusive trauma along with a brief description of the mechanismand pathophysiology of abusive injury. The diagnosis of AT is not always obvious. and abusive injuries in many infants may remain unrecognized. Pediatricians should be cognizant of AT since pediatricians play a crucial role in the diagnosis. management and prevention of AT....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health

65,An analytic design guide to design a three-stage cascade CMOS operational amplifier compensated by AC boosting frequency compensation (ACBC) method is presented in this paper. The procedure allows electrical parameters such as gain bandwidth (GBW) product or phase margin to be related to the value of circuit elements such as aspect ratio or biasing currents of transistors. The presented design guide is suited for pencil-and-paper design and yields accurate performance without unnecessary circuit constraint introduction. Simulation results using TSMC 0.18 mu m CMOS process verifies accuracy and robustness of proposed procedure. Various load capacitors and circuit conditions are simulated and. based on obtained results. the presented design guide is comprehensive and efficient since it leads us from frequency response parameters to aspect ratio of MOSFETs....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Operational amplifier
66,Programmable AC power sources have been widely used to implement and support a wide range of Test Procedure Specifications (TPS's). Traditionally. these power sources use analog control circuits to provide key control and protection functions like load regulation. current limit and frequency conversion. While this is a proven design. it suffers from a number of drawbacks. With the advent of recent advances in DSP technologies. a full digital implementation of an AC power source design supporting high switching frequencies is now feasible.

68,The voltage source converters (VSC) are the key power interfaces between the individual ac grids and dc grids in the hybrid power system. When the ac grid is unbalanced. the grid currents are distorted and the harmonic is induced. Meanwhile. the oscillations in the active and reactive power are also increased. which may damage these interfaces. In order to ensure the safety of the converters and the grid facility. a flexible control strategy is proposed for the ac/dc hybrid grid in this paper. At first. the current harmonic for the VSC is theoretically analyzed under unbalanced conditions. Furthermore. the methods to separate the positive- and negative-sequence components of the ac grid voltages are summed up and analyzed. Based on the theoretical analysis. different protected control methods are compared. A new control method. which can flexibly control oscillations of the active and reactive power by introducing a parameter k. has been proposed. The estimation of maximum current in each phase is discussed; meanwhile. the relationship between the voltage ripple on dc link and the parameter k is given. Finally. the validity and advantages of the proposed method are verified by the simulating and experimental results....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
69,Based on single-phase ac-ac converter with controllable phase and amplitude (ACCPA). a three-phase ACCPA without third harmonic trap was proposed for power transmission control in grid by adopting a symmetrical relationship of three phase. The three-phase ACCPA is comprised of two parts. which are used to adjust the phase and amplitude of three-phase output voltage. respectively. and continuously. Its front part is made up of three buck-type ac converters. and the back part is a three-phase boost-type ac converter. The operation principle of three-phase ACCPA. the adjustable ranges of the phase and amplitude of the front part. and the calculation formulas of control parameters under ideal conditions were studied and deduced in detail. Furthermore. the control accuracy of the phase angle was discussed for the three-phase ACCPA with digital control. and then. the method to select close-loop control parameters was obtained. The control strategy of three-phase ACCPA was presented and a prototype was fabricated. The experimental waveforms and testing results verified the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the feasibility of the control strategy....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Control engineering

The higher harmonics elimination works perfect and the power converter produces output voltage with less than 5% THD under linear or non-linear load. This paper describes the improved control system structure and its implementation in MATLAB Simulink environment. The advantages of the repetitive algorithm facing Fourier transform harmonic compensation are shown. The performance of the new control method is shown in simulation results. The algorithm is carried out in C language using MATLAB S-Function block so it is suitable for implementation in the real-time control systems....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
71,Various species of amoebas belonging to the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in many parts of the world. Some strains of these protozoans may exist as parasites and pose risks to human health as causative agents of serious human diseases. Currently in China there IS a lack of information about the distribution of Acanthamoeba strains in the environment. Accordingly. 261 environmental water samples taken from rivers. sewage. and pharmaceutical factory drains were collected in Qinghai Province. China. The material was filtered and then analysed with both LAMP and PCR assays. Of the samples examined. Acanthamoeba DNA was found in 32 (14.68%) samples with the use of LAMP; in 13 of these samples. DNA from this amoeba was also detected using PCR. Sequencing of selected positive samples confirmed that the PCR products were fragments of the Acanthamoeba 18S rRNA gene and that isolates represent the T4 genotype. known as the Most common strain related to AK cases. The results indicate that surface water. as well as water taken from sewage And pharmaceutical drains. may be a source of acanthamoebic strains potentially pathogenic for humans in China. It has been also demonstrated that LAMP assays is more sensitive than PCR and can be regarded as useful tool for screening the environment for Acanthamoeba spp. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

72,Particle accelerators consist of an enormous number of components and many of them operate with pulse voltage or current. Such accelerator components require precise voltage or current to keep the beams very stable. For this reason. many pulse power supplies used for accelerators have own subsystems to improve their performances. One example is a power supply for the scanning magnets of a pencil beam proton therapy. They use not only high-voltage inverters for the high-speed ramping but also low-voltage inverters for the precise current control. However. the use of intelligent digital controllers possibly simplifies such precise power supplies. We propose a method for precise current control using a digital control system. Our previous work has successfully controlled the pulse current of power supplies for synchrotron main magnets. In the next step. we have modified our previous method for faster power supplies such as ones for scanning magnets. In addition. we developed a control board using a high-performance FPGA so that our method can be implemented in the board. In this paper. we describe the details of our proposed method. and the experiments using a small-scale power supply and the developed control board....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control

74,A high performance interface circuit of sigma-delta accelerometer with low harmonic distortion used many kinds of circuit processing techniques is presented in this work. Multi-bit. dynamic element matching. correlated-double-sampling and electrostatic force feedback linearization circuit are used simultaneously in order to achieve the design indicators. Because of the usage of multi-bit. the design to operational amplifier (OPA) becomes easier. and only a single-stage folded-cascode amplifier is used in the modulator. the OSR is only 64. It highly reduced the difficulty of circuit. The test results indicate that the chip area is only about 10mm(2) and the power dissipation is 10mW with a sampling frequency of 60 kHz. The dynamic range (DR) of the system can be lower than -130 dB. the SNR and SNDR reach to -120 dB and -110 dB respectively with a resolution about 17 bits when referred to 3g full scale DC acceleration under CMOS 0.5 mu m process.

75,In this article we address the increasingly important yet understudied phenomenon of nonnative accentedness on decision making. In three experimental studies. we investigated whether messages about a company delivered in nonstandard-American-accented speech influenced choice. In Study 1. we found that individuals were more likely to choose a company or a product when a message was read in a standard American English accent than when the message was delivered with a Mandarin Chinese or a French accent. In Study 2. we found that expectations regarding company messages are violated when speakers have accents and that. in turn. expectation violations mediated the relationship between accent and choice. In Study 3. we replicated the findings of the effect of accent on choice using Indian and British accents. We also hypothesized and found support for a conditional indirect effects model such that implicit pro-American bias moderated the indirect relationship between accent and choice as mediated by expectation violations. Theoretical and practical implications of this topic of study are discussed....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Prejudice
76,Acceptance is a key construct in both rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). The objectives of this study were to assess and compare the properties of ACT acceptance with those of REBT acceptance in predicting emotions. A sample of 112 subjects. comprising different educational and occupational status. completed three measures of acceptance (REBT and ACT). two of mindfulness. as well as completing depression and anxiety scales. Both ACT acceptance as process and REBT acceptance could predict significant ACT acceptance as outcome. Mindfulness as a trait also predicted the level of ACT outcome acceptance as well as the level of REBT acceptance. but mindfulness as process predicted only ACT outcome acceptance. The results show that REBT acceptance. ACT acceptance and mindfulness can explain anxiety and depression in different ways. The results show that the difference between ACT acceptance and REBT acceptance primary concern the process of acceptance. most likely due to the underlying cognitive processing. The outcome acceptance and emotional level are similar in the two conditions. Future research should employ multiple cognitive measurements....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Depression

78,OBJECTIVE: Cervical imaging practices are poorly understood in young children with traumatic brain injury (TBI). We therefore sought to identify child-level and hospital-level factors associated with performance of cervical imaging of children with TBI from falls and abusive head trauma (AHT) and to describe across-hospital variation in cervical imaging performance. We hypothesized that imaging decisions would be influenced by hospital volume of young injured children. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of children younger than 2 years of age with TBI from 2009 to 2013 in the Premier Perspective Database. After adjustment for observed patient characteristics. we evaluated variation in advanced cervical imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) in children with AHT and TBI from falls. RESULTS: Of 2347 children with TBI. 18.7% were from abuse and 57.1% were from falls. Fifteen percent of children with TBI underwent advanced cervical imaging. Moderate or severe head injuries were associated with increased odds of cervical imaging in AHT (odds ratio 7.10; 95% confidence interval 2.75. 18.35) and falls (odds ratio 2.25; 95% confidence interval 1.19. 4.27). There was no association between annual hospital volume of injured children and cervical imaging performance. The adjusted probability of imaging across hospitals ranged from 4.3% to 84.3% in AHT and 3.1 to 39.0% in TBI from falls (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight variation across hospitals in adjusted probability of cervical imaging in AHT (nearly 20-fold) and TBI from falls (over 10-fold) not explained by observed patient characteristics. This variation suggests opportunities for further research to inform imaging practices....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health

The study also examined the demographic. ethnocultural. and psychological factors that could influence subcontinental migrant groups' attitudes towards acculturation and their acculturation strategies. MethodA cross-sectional design was used in which the dependent variables were the four acculturation strategies. Multivariate data analysis was conducted. Pearson's correlation. analysis of variance. and step-wise multiple regression analyses were performed to establish the relationships among the study variables. ResultsIntegration was the most preferred strategy and marginalisation was the least preferred strategy for all ethnic groups. Acculturation preferences are predicted partly by the adolescents' ethnicity. their ethnic identity. friendship choices. acculturative stress. sense of mastery (self-concept) and gender. The findings provide significant information on the acculturation practices of Indian subcontinental adolescents. including their ethnic identity search and commitment. their psychological well-being and their integration strategies. ConclusionsEducational institutions could benefit from increased awareness of the needs of these culturally diverse groups. especially if this information is incorporated into teacher training materials. The inclusion of intercultural relations courses in the academic curriculum would promote harmonious relations between culturally diverse ethnic groups....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Prejudice
80,In order to improve the dynamic responses of multimode controlled primary-side regulation flyback converter. a novel digital control method is proposed in this paper. A new DAC sampling method. which can capture the output voltage during dynamic transition. is introduced. Based on it. a dynamic module which can monitor the variation of the output voltage to improve the dynamic performance is proposed. In a 5-V/1-A primary-side regulation flyback converter. the maximum undershoot voltage and overshoot voltage of the proposed control scheme in this study are 0.472 and 0.192 V. respectively. They are much lower compared to 1.296 and 0.584 V in the traditional control scheme. The maximum undershoot and overshoot recovery times are reduced from 10.86 to 1.29 ms and 126.3 to 53.68 ms. respectively. The proposed control scheme was then verified by a FPGA controlled prototype....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
81,This study proposes high-performance voltage controller design that employs a capacitor current control model for single-phase stand-alone inverters. The single-phase stand-alone inverter is analyzed via modeling. which is then used to design the controller. A design methodology is proposed to maximize the bandwidth of the feedback controller. Subsequently. to compensate for the problems caused by the bandwidth limitations of the controller. an error transfer function that includes the feedback controller is derived. and the stability of the repetitive control scheme is evaluated using the error transfer function. The digital repetitive controller is then implemented. The simulation and experimental results show that the performance of the proposed controller is high in a 1.5 kW single-phase stand-alone inverter prototype....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
82,This work presents a novel mixed-signal control scheme for a boost power factor correction (PFC) rectifier. The digital controller modulates the inductor peak current to produce a low-distortion ac line current in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and continuous conduction mode (CCM). without the need for average current sensing. A lookup table (LUT) optimizes efficiency at low input currents. by allowing operation at 125-500-kHz DCM based on calculated thresholds. At high input currents. the converter operates at 1-MHz CCM for reduced inductor footprint. An analog off-time generator with a digital frequency locked loop facilitates CCM operation. eliminating the need for slope compensation in the current loop and reduces frequency variations. The LUT is programmed with an adaptive output voltage of 250/450 V for low/highmains line voltage (85-265Vrms) to optimize efficiency over a broad range of conditions. The 150-W PFC prototype operates up to 1 MHz with a peak efficiency of 95% and a total harmonic distortion of 5%....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Single-phase electric power
83,The theoretical and experimental analysis of a modified version of the SEPIC dc-dc converter used as preregulator operating in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) is presented in this paper. The proposed converter presents a low input current ripple operating in DCM. and the switch voltage is lower than the output voltage. The switch voltage reduction increases the converter reliability and a low drain-to-source on-resistance (RDSon) MOSFET can be used depending on the converter specification. Moreover. a digital control technique is applied to the proposed converter in order to reduce the third-harmonic input current distortion resultant of the operation in DCM. Finally. a 100-W prototype was developed operating with efficiency equal to 95.6%....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
84,In high-performance magnetic resonance imaging systems. the gradient driver is required to supply the gradient coil with a large current (>600 A) and a high voltage (>2000 V) to achieve a strong gradient field and a fast slew rate. In addition. extremely high fidelity for reproducing the current command from the central system is very critical to imaging quality. This paper presents the solutions for the different elements of the driver: 1) high-bandwidth (BW) power inverter; 2) ripple cancelation filter; 3) multioutput power supply (PS); and 4) digital control. A high-BW power inverter requires a stacked-bridges structure to achieve a high output ripple frequency with the existing commercial power semiconductor modules. The high voltage and the high frequency for large power modules can be obtained easier and with lower loss using the new silicon carbide devices. The control needs a digital implementation and a very fast processor. Digital control provides compensation and feedforward to improve the response. A capability improvement is obtained by reducing the switching frequency when large currents with a very low-frequency variation are needed. The control can handle it very well. but the filter has to be designed to eliminate more than one ripple frequency. Finally. many PS solutions have been used for multiple isolated outputs. but digital control compensation permits the use of much simpler unregulated PS and keeps the performance. A 2 MVA. 900 A/1200 V. platform has been built and fully tested. The experimental results proved the validity of the proposed structure and the modulation technique....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Single-phase electric power
85,Drug release belongs to the most challenging aspects of nanoparticles addressing molecular biology and medicine. Besides targeted delivery. obvious challenges are related to high drug load and continuous slow drug release. Based on our recently developed concept of inorganic-organic hybrid nanoparticles (IOH-NP). we here present [ZrO](2+)[AAP](2-) IOH-NPs containing the analgetic phosphate prodrug acetaminophen phosphate for drug release. [ZrO](2+)[AAP](2-) combines an uncomplex synthesis in water with a high prodrug load of 68 wt.%.[ZrO](2+)[AAP](2-) nanoparticles exhibit a diameter of 37(11) nm and can be readily obtained as colloidally highly stable suspension in water. The chemical composition is studied in detail based on infrared spectroscopy. energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. thermogravimetry and elemental analysis. Moreover. the release of acetaminophen from [ZrO](2+)[AAP](2-) is studied by means of model experiments indicating the carbon content of the nanoparticles and. in alternative. the fluorescence of labeled nanoparticles.

86,We have reported that orally administrated acetate contributed to suppression of lipogenesis in the liver and to reduction of lipid accumulation in the adipose tissue of Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acetate on skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. Treatment with acetate showed a higher rate of oxygen consumption and a smaller size of lipid droplets in white adipose and brown adipose tissues. An analysis by Northern blotting revealed that the transcripts of myoglobin and Glut4 genes in the abdominal muscle of the OLETF rats were increased by acetate treatment. while the transcripts of lipolytic genes increased in the white adipose and brown adipose tissues. It is possible that acetate has effects on lipid metabolism in the skeletal muscles and the adipose tissues. and has functions that work against obesity and obesity-linked type 2 diabetes....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Weight Loss
87,Acetate has been found to have an inhibitory effect on the activity of carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) in cultured hepatocytes. this being a transcription factor that regulates several genes required for the conversion of glucose to fatty acids in the liver. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an oral administration of acetate would contribute to reducing lypogenic genes and protecting against obesity. We orally injected 5.2mg/kg BW of acetate to obesity-linked type 2 diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. The treatment with acetate showed a marked reduction in lipid accumulation in the adipose tissue. protection against accumulation of fat in the liver. and improved glucose tolerance. An analysis by Northern blotting revealed that the transcripts of several lipogenic genes in the liver of OLETF rats were decreased by the acetate treatment. On the basis of those results. it was indicated that acetate was a potential compound to improve obesity and obesity-linked type 2 diabetes....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Human Metabolism
88,Research was carried out for the appraisal of toxic and anti-enzymetic action of acetone extracts of Datura inoxia and Azadirachta indica against Tribolium castaneum. Trogoderma granarium and Sitophilus granarius in the grain research training and storage management cell of department of entomology and in protein molecular biology laboratory (PMBL) department of biochemistry (UAF) during the year 2014. Various dilution levels viz.. 5.0. 10.0. 15.0 and 20.0% of both plants extracts were assessed against test insects. Toxic effect of plant extracts in T. castaneum. T. granarium and S. granarius was observed after an exposure period of 2. 4. 6. 8 and 10 days while inhibition of different enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE). a-carboxylesterase (alpha-CE). beta-carboxylesterase (beta-CE). acid phosphatases (ACP) and alkaline phosphatases (ALP) were calculated spectrophotometrically in the survivors of toxicity assay. The results evidenced that both plant extracts had lethal effects against three stored grain insect species. Comparison of means of mortality in T. castaneum. T. granarium and S. granarius proved that A. indica extract was more effective. causing maximum 38.41. 24.35 and 28.56% mortality. respectively. D. inoxia resulted in 15.12. 13.52 and 14.07% maximum mortality in T. castaneum. T. granarium and S. granarius. respectively. The results also revealed significant inhibition of AChE. alpha-CE. beta-CE. ACP and ALP upon exposure to various concentrations of tested plants. Plant extract of A. indica proved more efficient for the inhibition of all test enzymes in three stored grain insect pests.

89,Bacterial community analyses of samples from a pilot plant for the treatment of acid mine drainage (AMD) from the lignite-mining district in Lusatia (East Germany) had previously demonstrated the dominance of two groups of acidophilic iron oxidizers: the novel candidate genus "Ferrovum" and a group comprising Gallionella-like strains. Since pure culture had proven difficult. previous studies have used genome analyses of co-cultures consisting of "Ferrovum" and a strain of the heterotrophic acidophile Acidiphilium in order to obtain insight into the life style of these novel bacteria. Here we report on attempts to undertake a similar study on Gallionella-like acidophiles from AMD. Isolates belonging to the family Gallionellaceae are still restricted to the microaerophilic and neutrophilic iron oxidizers Sideroxydans and Gallionella. Availability of genomic or metagenomic sequence data of acidophilic strains of these genera should. therefore. be relevant for defining adaptive strategies in pH homeostasis. This is particularly the case since complete genome sequences of the neutrophilic strains G. capsiferriformans ES-2 and S. lithotrophicus ES-1 permit the direct comparison of the metabolic capacity of neutrophilic and acidophilic members of the same genus and. thus. the detection of biochemical features that are specific to acidophilic strains to support life under acidic conditions. Isolation attempts undertaken in this study resulted in the microaerophilic enrichment culture ADE-12-1 which. based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. consisted of at least three to four distinct Gallionellaceae strains that appear to be closely related to the neutrophilic iron oxidizer S. lithotrophicus ES-1. Key hypotheses inferred from the metabolic reconstruction of the metagenomic sequence data of these acidophilic Sideroxydans strains include the putative role of urea hydrolysis. formate oxidation and cyanophycin decarboxylation in pH homeostasis....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,DNA/RNA sequencing

91,c-Myc overexpression has been implicated in several malignancies including gastric cancer. Here. we report that acidified bile acids enhance tumor progression and telomerase activity in gastric cancer via c-Myc activation both in vivo and in vitro. c-Myc mRNA and protein levels were assessed in ten primary and five local recurrent gastric cancer samples by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting analysis. The gastric cancer cell line MGC803 was exposed to bile salts (100mol/L glycochenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid) in anacidmedium (pH 5.5) for 10min daily for 60weeks to develop an MGC803-resistant cell line. Control MGC803 cells were grown without acids or bile salts for 60weeks as a control. Cell morphology. proliferation. colony formation and apoptosis of MGC803-resistant cells were analyzed after 60weeks. To determine the involvement of c-Myc in tumor progression and telomere aging in MGC803-resistant cells. we generated xenografts in nude mice and measured xenograft volume and in vivo telomerase activity. The c-Myc and hTERT protein and mRNA levels were significantly higher in local recurrent gastric cancer samples than in primary gastric cancer samples. MGC803-resistant cells showed a marked phenotypic change under normal growth conditions with more clusters and acini. and exhibited increased cell viability and colony formation and decreased apoptosis in vitro. These phenotypic changes were found to be dependent on c-Myc activation using the c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4. MGC803-resistant cells also showed a c-Myc-dependent increase in xenograft growth and telomerase activity in vivo. In conclusion. these observations support the hypothesis that acidified bile acids enhance tumor progression and telomerase activity in gastric cancer and that these effects are dependent on c-Myc activity. These findings suggest that acidified bile acids play an important role in the malignant progression of local recurrent gastric cancer....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
92,Thermoelectric (TE) materials are important for the sustainable development because they enable the direct harvesting of low-quality heat into electricity. Among them. conducting polymers have attracted great attention arising from their advantages. such as flexibility. nontoxicity. easy availability. and intrinsically low thermal conductivity. In this work. a novel and facile method is reported to significantly enhance the TE property of poly(3.4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films through sequential post-treatments with common acids and bases. Compared with the as-prepared PEDOT:PSS. both the Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivities can be remarkably enhanced after the treatments. The oxidation level. which significantly impacts the TE property of the PEDOT:PSS films. can also be well tuned by controlling the experimental conditions during the base treatment. The optimal PEDOT:PSS films can have a Seebeck coefficient of 39.2 mu V K-1 and a conductivity of 2170 S cm(-1) at room temperature. and the corresponding power factor is 334 mu W (m(-1) K-2). The enhancement in the TE properties is attributed to the synergetic effect of high charge mobility by the acid treatment and the optimal oxidation level tuned by the base treatment....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electric motor
93,Background: Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as an important cause of infection in burn patients. This study aimed to characterize the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. determine the prevalence of oxacillinase and metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) genes. and type the A. baumannii isolates obtained from burn patients. Methods: During a 1-year period. a total of 40 nonduplicated isolates of A. baumannii were obtained from burn patients who were hospitalized in the Taleghani Burn Hospital in Ahvaz. in the southwest of Iran. Testing for antimicrobial susceptibility was carried out by disk diffusion and E-test. To screen MBL production. a double disk synergy and MBL E-test were performed. The presence of bla(OXA-23-like). bla(OXA-24-like). bla(OXA-51-like) and bla(OXA-58-like). bla(VIM). bla(IMP) and bla(SPM). and bla(NDM) was sought by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR was carried out for determination of isolates clonality. Results: Overall. 92.5% of isolates were carbapenem-resistant. Polymyxin B. colistin. and ampicillin-sulbactam were the most effective agents in vitro. with a susceptibility rate of 100%. 97.5%. and 72.5%. respectively. According to the double disk synergy and E-test. 55.6% and 97.3% of isolates were MBL producers. respectively. Furthermore. 70% of isolates harbored bla(OXA-23-like) and 20% were positive for bla(OXA-24-like). However. no encoding genes were detected for bla(VIM). bla(IMP) and bla(SPM). bla(NDM). and bla(OXA-58-like). Repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR revealed that carbapenem-resistant isolates belonged to four clones. including A. B. C. and D; the predominant clones were B and C. Conclusion: The rate of carbapenem resistance was high. and it appeared that bla(OXA-23-like) and bla(OXA-24-like) contributed to the carbapenem resistance of A. baumannii isolates. This result suggests that the two predominant clones of A. baumannii were spread among burn patients. In order to prevent future dissemination of resistant isolates among burn patients. an effective infection control plan is necessary. Copyright (C) 2017.

94,The aim of the present study was to investigate the resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii. which was induced by cefepime (FEP). cefoperazone-sulbactam (SCF). tazobactam (TZP). levofloxacin (LEV). amikacin (AK). imipenem (IPM). and ciprofloxacin (CIP). in vitro. Multi-step drug resistance selection of 16 A. baumannii strains was performed using seven antibacterial agents (FEP. TZP. CIP. AK. IPM. SCF. and LEV). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the agar dilution method. Random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze the genotypes and the carrying rates of aac(3)-I. aac(6)-I. ant(3)-I. aph(3)-Via. OXA-23. OXA-24. AmpC. TEM-1. metallo--lactamase gene (IMP). armA. rmtA. rmtB. parC. gyrA and adeB. Expression of adeB was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Semi-qRT-PCR). Among the 16 strains. 15 strains with drug resistance (93.8%) were obtained following in vitro induction. Notable increases (8- to 128-fold) were noted in the MIC and different genotypes were showed in RAPD of the strains before and after performing the drug resistant test. PCR data revealed significant differences (P<0.05) between the carrying rates of resistant genes before and after drug induction. with the exception of rmtA. OXA-24. TEM-1. and IMP. Significant increases were demonstrated in the comparative adeB grayscale in strains that underwent drug induction when compared with the sensitive strains (55.69 +/- 43.11% vs. 10.08 +/- 26.35%; P=0.001). Findings of the present study suggest that the active efflux pump. adeB. has an important role in multidrug resistance of the A. baumannii induced by antibacterial agents in vitro....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Fungal Infection
95,We characterized 72 isolates with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems (50 Acinetobacter spp.. 13 Proteus mirabilis. five Escherichia coli. one Morganella morganii. one Enterobacter cloacae. one Providencia rettgeri. and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa) from a hospital in Sofia. Bulgaria. Different -lactamase genes were identified by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Bacterial strain typing was performed by enzymatic macrorestriction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing as well as multilocus sequence typing for selected isolates. The majority of Acinetobacter baumannii (46/50) and one Acinetobacter pittii isolate harbored carbapenemase genes bla(OXA-23) or bla(OXA-72); two A. baumannii contained both genes. PFGE typing of all A. baumannii showed the presence of nine different clones belonging to eight sequence types ST350. ST208. ST436. ST437. ST449. ST231. ST502. and ST579. Molecular characterization of the remaining isolates confirmed the presence of one NDM-1-producing E. coli-ST101 clone (five isolates) and one P. mirabilis clone (13 isolates) with VIM-1 and CMY-99. Furthermore. NDM-1 was identified in P. rettgeri and M. morganii and VIM-2 in the P. aeruginosa isolate. The permanent introduction of OXA-23/72 carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii clones into the hospital and the repeated occurrence of one VIM-1-producing P. mirabilis and one NDM-1-producing E. coli-ST101 clone over a period of more than 1 year is of concern and requires intensified investigations....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,HIV/AIDS
96,Background Acotiamide is widely used to improve symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD) in multiple large-scale clinical studies. but there are few reports about the drug's mechanism of action. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of acotiamide on gastric accommodation and gastric emptying. gastrointestinal symptoms. and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) in a placebo-controlled study. Methods We conducted a randomized. double-blind placebo-controlled study. Fifty Japanese FD patients were randomly assigned to either placebo (n = 25) or acotiamide 100 mg x 3/day for 2 weeks (n = 25). At baseline and at 2 weeks of treatment. we evaluated the patients' gastric motility using scintigraphy to determine the accommodation and emptying values. gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS). HR-QOL (SF-8). and anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Results Four patients failed to complete the medication regimen and were omitted from analysis; data from 24 placebo patients and 22 acotiamide patients were analyzed. Acotiamide significantly increased gastric accommodation compared to the placebo (p = 0.04 vs. p = 0.08; respectively). Acotiamide significantly accelerated gastric emptying (50 % half-emptying time) (p = 0.02 vs. p = 0.59). Acotiamide significantly improved the total GSRS scores compared to placebo (p = 0.0007 vs. p = 0.14). HR-QOL did not differ significantly between the two groups. but acotiamide significantly improved the HADS anxiety score compared to placebo (p = 0.04 vs. p = 0.20). Conclusions Our placebo-controlled study demonstrated that acotiamide significantly increased both gastric accommodation and gastric emptying in Japanese FD patients. Acotiamide also improved the patients' dyspeptic symptoms and anxiety score....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Digestive Health
97,The objective of this study was to determine global gene expression in relation to Vestibular schwannomas (VS) growth rate and to identify signal transduction pathways and functional molecular networks associated with growth. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to surgery determined tumor growth rate. Following tissue sampling during surgery. mRNA was extracted from 16 sporadic VS. Double stranded cDNA was synthesized from the mRNA and used as template for in vitro transcription reaction to synthesize biotin-labeled antisense cRNA. which was hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133A arrays and analyzed by dChip software. Differential gene expression was defined as a 1.5-fold difference between fast and slow growing tumors (>< 0.5 ccm/year). employing a p-value < 0.01. Deregulated transcripts were matched against established gene ontology. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used for identification of signal transduction pathways and functional molecular networks associated with tumor growth. In total 109 genes were deregulated in relation to tumor growth rate. Genes associated with apoptosis. growth and cell proliferation were deregulated. Gene ontology included regulation of the cell cycle. cell differentiation and proliferation. among other functions. Fourteen pathways were associated with tumor growth. Five functional molecular networks were generated. This first study on global gene expression in relation to vestibular schwannoma growth rate identified several genes. signal transduction pathways and functional networks associated with tumor progression.

99,Conversion of mechanical forces. vibrations and sound which have energy in the range of milli- to tens of watts (also referred to as "small kinetic energies" in this paper) into electricity has received global attention owing to the potential in powering electronic devices. However. most of the small kinetic energy generators can only generate electric power below 1 mu W/cm(3). As a result. an energy storage device is required to accumulate the energy generated until it reaches a sufficient level. Herein. we report the exceptionally-high acoustoelectric conversion ability of randomly-orientated electrospun poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) nanofiber nonwoven webs. The optimized device under sound is able to generate peak voltage and current of 14.5 V and 28.5 mu A with a volume power density output of 306.5 mu W/cm(3) (5.9 mW/cm(3) based on nanofiber web thickness). Without accumulation in any energy storage unit. the electricity generated by the nanofiber device is sufficient to light up tens of commercial LEDs. run electrochemical reactions and protect metals from corrosion. Such a novel acoustoelectric generator may offer an effective solution to recycling noise pollution into usable electricity....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electrical generator

1,Objective: To unravel the interplay between HIV-1 and its host cell. the effect of HIV-1 infection on cellular gene expression was investigated. Methods: HIV-1(SF33)-infected and uninfected H9 T cells were screened by differential display and RNase protection assay. The finding (PDS5A) was confirmed in HIV-1(Lai)-infected P4-CCR5 HeLa cells. which were also examined after PDS5A siRNA knockdown in regard to HIV-1 replication by quantitative RT-PCR. p24 ELISA and LTR-driven beta-galactosidase expression. The PDS5A knockdown effect on cellular gene expressions was studied by microarray analysis. PDS5A tissue expression was determined by Northern blotting. Results: Regulator of cohesion maintenance. homolog A (PDS5A) was found to be down-regulated by HIV-1. When PDS5A was suppressed by siRNA. HIV-1 replication was unaffected. PDS5A was found to be highly expressed in skeletal muscle tissue. and to lesser degrees in pancreas. heart. placenta. lung. kidney. liver and brain. Microarray analysis of PDS5A knockdown revealed 91 differential gene products over-representing cell cycle. transport and protein stability regulation. including 4 genes (PP2A. RANTES. PCAF. TCF7L2) previously reported to interact with HIV-1. Conclusion: The data show a downregulation of proliferation-associated host gene PDS5A and suggest a role of PDS5A in HIV-1-induced cellular pathogenesis but not viral replication.

2,Powder coatings have been receiving attention because they are environmentally friendly. They do not contain solvents in their composition. and their components have decorative and corrosion-protection functions. among many others. However. the presence of polymers in their composition increases the risk of combustion in adverse situations. In this context. this study aims to develop and characterize acrylic-based powder paints with the addition of 2 wt % and 4 wt % montmorillonite clays (MMT) as Cloisite 30B (MMT-30B) and Cloisite 15A (MTT-15A). employed as flame retardants. The characterization of the coatings was carried out by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). X-ray diffraction. and scanning electron microscopy. After application of the coatings on carbon steel substrates. flammability tests were performed. The coatings with 2 wt % MMT-30B showed overall better results. especially in the flammability tests. Flames spread less on these coatings than on the other systems. However. when the surface and bottom temperatures were analyzed by the cone calorimeter test. the samples prepared with 4 wt % MMT-15A were considered safer to be applied in fire scenarios.

3,Purpose/Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of quetiapine XR and lithium on actigraphy-measured circadian parameters in patients with bipolar II depression. Methods/Procedures: This was an 8-week. open-label. prospective. randomized comparative study. The assessments included the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score and actigraphic measures concerning the previous 7 days. collected at each visit (weeks 0 [baseline]. 1. 2. 4. 6. and 8); the actigraphic data were analyzed with a cosinor analysis. Findings/Results: Medication. time. and the interaction between medication and time were significantly associated with acrophase for the entire group (Ps = 0.003. 0.020. and 0.042. respectively). More specifically. acrophase was significantly delayed at weeks 1 and 6 (Ps = 0.004 and 0.039. respectively) in the quetiapine XR group. The F statistics significantly increased over time for the entire group (P < 0.001). and there was a significant increase in F statistics on weeks 4 and 6 in the quetiapine XR group (Ps = 0.016 and 0.020. respectively) and on weeks 4 and 8 in the lithium group (Ps = 0.001 and 0.016. respectively). In addition. scores on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were significantly associated with the F statistics during 8 weeks for the entire group (P = 0.008). Implications/Conclusions: Both quetiapine XR and lithium affected several circadian parameters. including peak activity time and robustness of circadian rhythm. but exerted different effects on acrophase in patients with bipolar II depression. In particular. clinical depressive symptoms were associated with robustness of circadian rhythm during the course of the 8-week treatment....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Bipolar Disorder
4,Actinobacteria are Gram-positive bacteria commonly found in soil. freshwater and marine ecosystems. In this investigation. bias in codon usages of ninety actinobacterial genomes was analyzed by estimating different indices of codon bias such as Nc (effective number of codons). SCUO (synonymous codon usage order). RSCU (relative synonymous codon usage). as well as sequence patterns of codon contexts. The results revealed several characteristic features of codon usage in Actinobacteria. as follows: 1) C- or G-ending codons are used frequently in comparison with A- and U ending codons; 2) there is a direct relationship of GC content with use of specific amino acids such as alanine. proline and glycine; 3) there is an inverse relationship between GC content and Nc estimates. 4) there is low SCUO value (<0.5) for most genes; and 5) GCC-GCC. GCC-GGC. GCC-GAG and CUC-GAC are the frequent context sequences among codons. This study highlights the fact that: 1) in Actinobacteria. extreme GC content and codon bias are driven by mutation rather than natural selection; (2) traits like aerobicity are associated with effective natural selection and therefore low GC content and low codon bias. demonstrating the role of both mutational bias and translational selection in shaping the habitat and phenotype of actinobacterial species.

5,Mirror neurons (MNs) are a fascinating class of cells originally discovered in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and. subsequently. in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) of the macaque. which become active during both the execution and observation of actions. In this review. I will first highlight the mounting evidence indicating that mirroring others' actions engages a broad system of reciprocally connected cortical areas. which extends well beyond the classical IPL-PMv circuit and might even include subcortical regions such as the basal ganglia. Then. I will present the most recent findings supporting the idea that the observation of one's own actions. which might play a role in the ontogenetic origin and tuning of MNs. retains a particular relevance within the adult MN system. Finally. I will propose that both cortical and subcortical mechanisms do exist to decouple MN activity from the motor output. in order to render it exploitable for high-order perceptual. cognitive. and even social functions. The findings reviewed here provide an original framework for envisaging the main challenges and experimental directions of future neurophysiological and neuroanatomical studies of the monkey MN system....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
6,In this paper a new framework is introduced to develop a coupled active and reactive market in distribution networks. Distributed energy resources (DERs) such as synchronous machine-based distributed generations and wind turbines offer their active and reactive powers to the proposed market. For the considered DERs. multicomponent reactive power bidding structures are introduced based on their capability curves. Also. the hourly speed variations of wind turbines are considered in the proposed model. A distribution company buys active and reactive powers from a wholesale market and sells them via this market. The demand side is active. and responsive loads or aggregators can participate in the market using a demand bidding/buyback program. The objective function of the proposed market is to minimize the active and reactive power costs of DERs and distribution companies. the penalty cost of CO2 emission. and the cost of running a demand bidding/buyback program. The effectiveness of the proposed method is examined on a 22-bus 20-kV radial distribution test system....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electrical network
7,A highly reconfigurable merged analog baseband (MABB) with not only tunable bandwidth (BW). gain. and order but also reconfigurable power. noise. and linearity is proposed for multistandard integrated wireless receivers in this brief. The MABB could arrange the total gain to different stages for noise and linearity tradeoffs by introducing the merged biquad topology. To save power. the operational amplifier (Opamp) for the proposed MABB can reduce the GBW. as long as it meets the GBW requirement for different BW. gain. and order. A flexible power-efficient high-GBW Opamp with an adaptive common-mode bias circuit is also proposed for the eighth-order active-RC MABB. The proposed MABB covers a cutoff frequency range from 200 kHz to 20 MHz. whereas the gain could be tuned between 0 and 72 dB. The proposed highly reconfigurable MABB is suitable for multistandard integrated wireless receivers....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing

9,This paper presents different state feedback approaches of finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) applied to a grid-connected voltage-source converter (VSC) with an LCL filter. Besides converter-side current feedback. two multivariable control approaches and line-side current control are introduced and compared based on theoretical and experimental evaluation. As the LCL filter introduces an additional resonance frequency to the system. the use of different active damping (AD) methods in combination with FCS-MPC is discussed. Furthermore. practical control implementation issues are discussed. The presented methods reveal the great potential. high dynamic performance. and flexibility of FCS-MPC. enabling multivariable control as well as both reduced switching losses and low harmonic current distortion at the same time. Eventually. the feasibility of the theoretical control concepts is shown in a laboratory environment....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Control engineering
10,Capacitor current feedback active damping is extensively used in grid-connected converters with an LCL filter. However. systems tends to become unstable when the digital control delay is taken into account. especially in low switching frequencies. This paper discusses this issue by deriving a discrete model with a digital control delay and by presenting the stable region of an active damping loop from high to low switching frequencies. In order to overcome the disadvantage of capacitor current feedback active damping. this paper proposes a modified approach using grid current and converter current for feedback. This can expand the stable region and provide sufficient active damping whether in high or low switching frequencies. By applying the modified approach. the active damping loop can be simplified from fourth-order into second-order. and the design of the grid current loop can be simplified. The modified approach can work well when the grid impedance varies. Both the active damping performance and the dynamic performance of the current loop are verified by simulations and experimental results....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
11,The high-power grid-connected inverters with LCL filters have been widely used. Current control plays a key role in the grid-connected inverter control system. To cope with the inherent resonance of the LCL filter. active damping (AD) methods are usually employed. However. the AD performance is impaired by control delays which are introduced in the digital control implementation process. Besides. the lag phase due to control delays limits the system bandwidth and stability margin. The effects of control delays are more noteworthy in the high-power grid-connected inverter due to its low switching frequency. This paper investigates the current control strategy based on multisampling for the high-power grid-connected inverter with the LCL filter. First. the multisampled AD scheme is studied. which can reduce control delays effectively and improve AD performance. Besides. the multisampled control without additional damping whether passive or active is researched. Through the inverter-side current feedback. the system can realize single-current-loop control based on multisampling. Thus. the control system is simplified and it can be stable. and achieve better dynamic performance. Finally. experimental results show that the proposed control schemes are effective....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Control engineering
12,Resonant poles of LCL filters may challenge the entire system stability especially in digital-controlled pulse width modulation (PWM) inverters. In order to tackle the resonance issues. many active damping solutions have been reported. For instance. a notch filter can be employed to damp the resonance. where the notch frequency should be aligned exactly to the resonant frequency of the LCL filter. However. parameter variations of the LCL filter as well as the time delay appearing in digital control systems will induce resonance drifting. and thus break this alignment. possibly deteriorating the original damping. In this paper. the effectiveness of the notch filter-based active damping is first explored. considering the drifts of the resonant frequency. It is revealed that when the resonant frequency drifts away from its nominal value. the phase lead or lag introduced by the notch filter may make itself fail to damp the resonance. Specifically. the phase lag can make the current control stable despite of the resonant frequency drifting. when the grid current is fed back. In contrast. in the case of an inverter current feedback control. the influence of the phase lead or lag on the active damping is dependent on the actual resonant frequency. Accordingly. in this paper. the notch frequency is designed away from the nominal resonant frequency to tolerate the resonance drifting. being the proposed robust active damping. Simulations and experiments performed on a 2.2-kW three-phase grid-connected PWM inverter verify the effectiveness of the proposed design for robust active damping using digital notch filters....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
13,Control of the LCL-type three-phase grid-connected converter is difficult due to high resonance peak of the LCL filter. Active damping is the state-of-the-art solution to this problem. but the damping performance will be affected by the inherent time delay of digital control. especially for high-power low switching frequency applications. Based on a discrete-time stability analysis of an LCL-type converter with capacitor-current-feedback active damping. a simple and effective time delay compensation method. which is based on area equalization concept. is proposed. The method can reduce the negative impact of the computation delay significantly. It has the potential to serve as a general solution to time delay compensation of a digitally controlled PWM converter. The validity of the proposed method is proved by experimental results....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
14,The wind power generation techniques are continuing to develop and increasing numbers of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind power systems are connecting to the on-shore and off-shore grids. local standalone weak networks. and microgrid applications. The impedances of the weak networks are too large to be neglected and require careful attention. Due to the impedance interaction between the weak network and the DFIG system. both subsynchronous resonance (SSR) and high-frequency resonance (HFR) may occur when the DFIG system is connected to the series or parallel compensated weak network. This paper will discuss the SSR and the HFR phenomena based on the impedance modeling of the DFIG system and the weak networks. and the cause of these two resonances will be explained in details. The following factors will be discussed in this paper: 1) transformer configuration; 2) different power scale of DFIG system with different parameters; 3) L or LCL filter adopted in the grid side converter (GSC); 4) rotor speed; 5) current closed-loop controller parameters; and 6) digital control delay. On the basis of the analysis. active damping strategies for HFR using virtual impedance concept will be proposed....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Electrical generator
15,Energy storage systems (ESSs) are generally planned based on the active power. While. reactive power is another important aspect of the ESSs that has not been adequately addressed and discussed. Moreover. ESSs are often managed individually. but coordinated planning on the ESSs and distributed generators (DGs) may result in more suitable outcomes. In order to address these issues. a coordinated ESS and DG planning is presented in this paper. In the proposed planning. the place and capacity of the ESSs and DGs are determined at the same time. The active and reactive powers are included in the planning for both the ESSs and DGs. In other words. the optimal active and reactive capacities are denoted for both the ESSs and DGs on the network. The proposed coordinated ESS and DG planning is carried out on a radial distribution network under deregulated electricity market. Objective function of the proposed planning is to maximize the profit of distribution company (DISCO) subject to the secure operation of the network. The planning is expressed as a nonlinear. mixed integer optimization problem and solved by advanced PSO as a strong Meta-heuristic optimization technique. Simulation results demonstrate the great impacts of the proposed planning on the network. The results demonstrate the priority of the proposed coordinated DG and ESS planning compared to the individual ESS planning. Additionally. it is verified that considering reactive power of the DGs and ESSs changes the results of the planning and provides more realistic and reasonable outputs. The proposed planning significantly increases DISCO profit while guarantees the safe operation of the network through satisfying several security constraints....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electrical network
16,In this paper we present an analysis of the voltage amplifier needed for double differential (DD) sEMG measurements and a novel. very simple circuit for implementing DD active electrodes. The three-input amplifier that standalone DD active electrodes require is inherently different from a differential amplifier. and general knowledge about its design is scarce in the literature. First. the figures of merit of the amplifier are defined through a decomposition of its input signal into three orthogonal modes. This analysis reveals a mode containing EMG crosstalk components that the DD electrode should reject. Then. the effect of finite input impedance is analyzed. Because there are three terminals. minimum bounds for interference rejection ratios due to electrode and input impedance unbalances with two degrees of freedom are obtained. Finally. a novel circuit design is presented. including only a quadruple operational amplifier and a few passive components. This design is nearly as simple as the branched electrode and much simpler than the three instrumentation amplifier design. while providing robust EMG crosstalk rejection and better input impedance using unity gain buffers for each electrode input. The interference rejection limits of this input stage are analyzed. An easily replicable implementation of the proposed circuit is described. together with a parameter design guideline to adjust it to specific needs. The electrode is compared with the established alternatives. and sample sEMG signals are obtained. acquired on different body locations with dry contacts. successfully rejecting interference sources....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
17,The performance of some Fourier transform based fundamental current detection algorithms is evaluated and compared in this paper. Some difficult conditions are imposed by a load which draws a highly distorted current with a slight fluctuation. i. e. with non-equal semi-periods.

18,A high-efficiency. high-power-density buffer architecture is proposed for power pulsation decoupling in power conversion between dc and single-phase ac. We present an active decoupling solution that yields improved efficiency and reduced circuit complexity compared to existing solutions. In the proposed architecture. the main energy storage capacitor is connected in series with an active buffer converter across the dc bus. The series-stacked capacitor blocks the majority of the dc bus voltage to reduce the voltage stress on the buffer converter. such that fast. low-voltage transistors can be employed for the buffer converter. Moreover. the series capacitor provides the majority of the power pulsation decoupling through a wide voltage swing. and the buffer converter only needs to process a small fraction of the total power of the entire architecture. allowing a very small active circuit volume and very high system efficiency. The circuit operation and design constraints are analyzed in detail. In the proposed buffer architecture. the series stacking of a nearly lossless capacitor and a lossy converter presents a challenge of capacitor voltage balancing and power loss compensation. We propose a control scheme exploiting the small ripple in the bus voltage and dc input current to compensate for the power loss in the buffer converter while maintaining the voltage balance. Light-load techniques are also introduced to ensure that the buffer architecture meets strict ripple requirements while providing sufficient loss compensation. A 2-kW hardware prototype based on low-voltage GaN switches has been built to demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution. A power density of 25W/cm(3) (410 W/in(3)) by rectangular box volume and an efficiency above 98.9% across a wide load range has been experimentally verified....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Single-phase electric power

20,Equivalently implementing a generalized memristor by using common components and then making a nonlinear circuit with a reliable property. are conducive to experimentally exhibit the nonlinear phenomena of the memristive chaotic circuit and show practical applications in generating chaotic signals. Firstly. based on a memristive diode bridge circuit. a new first-order actively generalized memristor emulator is constructed with no grounded restriction and ease to realize. The mathematical model of the emulator is established and its fingerprints are analyzed by the pinched hysteresis loops with different sinusoidal voltage stimuli. The results verified by experimental measurements indicate that the emulator uses only one operational amplifier and nine elementary electronic circuit elements and is an active voltage-controlled generalized memristor. Secondly. by parallelly connecting the proposed emulator to a capacitor and then linearly coupling with an RC bridge oscillator. a memristor based chaotic circuit without any inductance element is constructed. The dynamical model of the inductorless memristive chaotic circuit is established and the phase portraits of the chaotic attractor with typical circuit parameters are obtained numerically. The dissipativity. equilibrium points. and stabilities are derived. which indicate that in the phase space of the inductorless memristive chaotic circuit there exists a dissipative area where are distributed two unstable nonzero saddle-foci and a non-dissipative area containing an unstable origin saddle point. Furthermore. by utilizing the bifurcation diagram. Lyapunov exponent spectra. and phase portraits. the dynamical behaviors of the inductorless memristive chaotic circuit are investigated. Results show that with the evolution of the parameter value of the coupling resistor. the complex nonlinear phenomena of the coexisting bifurcation modes and coexisting attractors under two different initial conditions of the state variables can be found in the inductorless memristive chaotic circuit. Finally. a prototype circuit with the same circuit parameters for numerical simulations is developed. from which it can be seen that the prototype circuit has a simple circuit structure and is inexpensive and easy to practically fabricate with common components. Results of both the experimental measurements and the numerical simulations are consistent. verifying the validity of the theoretical analyses....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Electrical circuits

29,Aims: Activin E is a newly identified member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily. To assess the role of activin E in glucose/energy metabolism. we investigated the transcriptional regulation of activin E in the liver. Main methods: Northern blotting. Western blotting. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used in this study. Key findings: Insulin up-regulated activin E expression at the mRNA and protein level in HepG2 cells. Reporter assays revealed that the putative. functional. promoter sequence of human activin E gene was responsible for the effect of insulin. Mutational analysis of the promoter revealed that CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) play a key role in regulating activin E expression and in the stimulatory effect of insulin on activin E transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the C/EBPs can bind to the activin E promoter in HepG2 cells. The expression of activin E mRNA was up-regulated in the liver of diet-induced obese mice. Significance: These observations suggest that activin E plays a pathophysiological role in glucose metabolism. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

30,Background and purpose: Few studies have examined why some patients with dementia stop attending medical consultations. We conducted a retrospective study to investigate factors associated with discontinuous clinic attendance. Methods: Participants were 988 patients with dementia from university hospital (UH) clinics and affiliated local hospital (LH) clinics. We compared continuous and discontinuous attenders on cognitive and affective functions and activities of daily living (ADL). and also compared UH and LH patients (UH: continuous. n = 176; discontinuous. n = 207; LH: continuous. n = 418; discontinuous. n = 187). Results: The total annual rate of discontinuation was 8.0%. and the mean period of attendance before discontinuation was 2.2 2.4 years (UH. 2.8 +/- 3.0; LH. 1.5 +/- 1.3. P < 0.01).

Abe's behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) score. and ADL were significantly worse in the discontinuous group than the continuous group for both UH and LH patients (P < 0.01). The best predictor of discontinuation was ADL decline (UH and LH) and Abe's BPSD score (UH). The most common reason for discontinuation was returning to the family doctor (39.1% for UH). and cessation of hospital attendance at their own discretion (35.3% for LH).

Microgrids are clusters of loads and microsources that operate within a single controllable system. which provides electricity and heat to its local area even if they get separated from the distribution system. Several commercial solutions are addressing this topic using numerous methods; however. to keep the computing time required to solve the system when the size of the system grows represents a major challenge.

This paper also provides the design of a low input voltage (24 V) and variable high output voltage (0-2.5 kV) bidirectional dc-dc flyback converter for driving a capacitive incremental actuator. The incremental actuator consists of three electrically isolated-mechanically connected capacitive actuators. It requires three high-voltage (HV) (2-2.5 kV) bidirectional dc-dc converters to accomplish the incremental motion by charging and discharging the capacitive actuators. The bidirectional flyback converter employs a digital controller to improve the efficiency and charge/discharge speed using the valley switching technique during both charge and discharge processes. without the need to sense signals on the output HV side.

These liver disorders are pre-eclampsia. hemolysis. elevated liver enzymes. low platelet count (HELLP). acute fatty liver. hyperemesis gravidarum. and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. On the other hand. pre-existing autoimmune liver injury of the mother can be affected by pregnancy. This review intends to summarize current knowledge linking feto-maternal immunology and liver inflammation with a special emphasis on novel potential biomarkers....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Parenting
34,Background: Reporting new cases of enterovirus (EV)-D68-associated acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is essential to understand how the virus causes neurological damage and to characterize EV-D68 strains associated with AFM. Case presentation: A previously healthy 4-year-old boy presented with sudden weakness and limited mobility in his left arm. Two days earlier. he had an upper respiratory illness with mild fever. At admission. his physical examination showed that the child was febrile (38.5 degrees C) and alert but had a stiff neck and weakness in his left arm. which was hypotonic and areflexic. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed a mild increase in white blood cell count (80/mm(3). 41% neutrophils) and a slightly elevated protein concentration (76 gm/dL). Bacterial culture and molecular biology tests for detecting viral infection in CSF were negative. The patient was then treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and acyclovir. Despite therapy. within 24 h. the muscle weakness extended to all four limbs. which exhibited greatly reduced mobility. Due to his worsening clinical prognosis. the child was transferred to our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; at admission he was diagnosed with acute flaccid paralysis of all four limbs. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was negative. except for a focal signal alteration in the dorsal portion of the medulla oblongata. also involving the pontine tegmentum. whereas spine MRI showed an extensive signal alteration of the cervical and dorsal spinal cord reported as myelitis. Signal alteration was mainly localized in the central grey matter. most likely in the anterior horns. Molecular biology tests performed on nasopharyngeal aspirate and on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were negative for bacteria but positive for EV-D68 clade B3. Plasmapheresis was performed and corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulins were administered. After 4 weeks of treatment. the signs and symptoms of AFM were significantly reduced. although some weakness and tingling remained in the patient's four limbs. MRI acquired after 3 weeks showed that the previously reported alterations were no longer present. Conclusion: This case suggests that EV-D68 is a neurotropic agent that can cause AFM and strains are circulating in Europe. EV-D68 disease surveillance is required to better understand EV-D68 pathology and to compare various strains that cause AFM....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Children's Health
35,Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) remains a major complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. with a significant proportion of patients failing to respond to first-line systemic corticosteroids. Reliable biomarkers predicting disease severity and response to treatment are warranted to improve its management. Thus. we sought to determine whether pentraxin 3 (PTX3). an acutephase protein produced locally at the site of inflammation. could represent a novel acute GvHD biomarker. Using a murine model of the disease. we found increased PTX3 plasma levels after irradiation and at GvHD onset. Similarly. plasma PTX3 was enhanced in 115 pediatric patients on day of transplantation. likely due to conditioning. and at GvHD onset in patients experiencing clinical symptoms of the disease. PTX3 was also found increased in skin and colon biopsies from patients with active disease. Furthermore. PTX3 plasma levels at GvHD onset were predictive of disease outcome since they resulted significantly higher in both severe and therapyunresponsive patients. Multiple injections of rhPTX3 in the murine model of GvHD did not influence the disease course. Taken together. our results indicate that PTX3 constitutes a biomarker of GvHD severity and therapy response useful to tailor treatment intensity according to early risk-stratification of GvHD patients....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Myelofibrosis
36,Objective and design Cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been widely used in the perioperative period of cancer surgery. which exacerbates the risk of renal injury. In this study. we examined whether dexmedetomidine (DEX). a commonly used anesthetic adjuvant. shows a protective effect against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury. Materials Acute kidney injury in mice was induced by cisplatin. Treatments Mice were administered with DEX 25 mu g/kg or atipamezole 250 mu g/kg (once a day. for 3 days) after cisplatin treatment. Methods The renal function and tubular damage score were evaluated at 72 h following cisplatin administration. Apoptotic tubular cells were detected by TUNEL assay. Caspase-3. p53. Bax. F4/80(+) macrophages. CD3(+) T cells. and NF-kappa B were examined by immunohistochemistry staining or Western blot. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. interleukin (IL)-1 beta. IL-6. and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in kidney were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results DEX treatment preserved renal function and reduced tubular damage score of mice after cisplatin administration. Mice treated with DEX exhibited less apoptotic tubular cells in response to cisplatin insult. which was associated with decreased Bax and reduced activation of p53 and caspase-3. DEX suppressed the infiltration of macrophages and T cells into the kidneys following cisplatin treatment. which was involved in the inhibition of NF-kappa B activation and decreased expression of TNF-alpha. IL-1 beta. IL-6. and MCP-1. Furthermore. we showed that the renoprotective effect conferred by DEX may be related to alpha(2) adrenoceptor-dependent pathway. Conclusion We demonstrate that DEX protects the kidney against cisplatin-induced AKI by the regulation of apoptosis and inflammatory response....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Kidney Health
37,Background: Cell necrosis. oxidative damage. and fibrogenesis are involved in cirrhosis development. a condition in which insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels are diminished. This study evaluates whether the exogenous administration of low doses of IGF-1 can induce hepatoprotection in acute carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver damage compared to healthy controls (Wt Igf(+/+)). Additionally. the impact of IGF-1 deficiency on a damaged liver was investigated in mice with a partial deficit of this hormone (Hz Igf1(+/-)). Methods: Three groups of 25 +/- 5-week-old healthy male mice (Wt Igf(+/+)) were included in the protocol: untreated controls (Wt). Controls that received CCl4 (Wt + CCl4) and Wt + CCl4 were treated subcutaneously with IGF-1 (2 mu g/100 g body weight/day) for 10 days (Wt + CCl4 + IGF1). In parallel. three IGF-1-deficient mice (Hz Igf1(+/-)) groups were studied: untreated Hz. Hz + CCl4. and Hz + CCl4 + IGF-1. Microarray and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses. serum aminotransferases levels. liver histology. and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were assessed at the end of the treatment in all groups. All data represent mean +/- SEM. Results: An altered gene coding expression pattern for proteins of the extracellular matrix. fibrosis. and cellular protection were found. as compared to healthy controls. in which IGF-1 therapy normalized in the series including healthy mice. Liver histology showed that Wt + CCl4 + IGF1 mice had less oxidative damage. fibrosis. lymphocytic infiltrate. and cellular changes when compared to the Wt + CCl4. Moreover. there was a correlation between MDA levels and the histological damage score (Pearson's r = 0.858). In the IGF-1-deficient mice series. similar findings were identified. denoting a much more vulnerable hepatic parenchyma. Conclusions: IGF1 treatment improved the biochemistry. histology. and genetic expression of pro-regenerative and cytoprotective factors in both series (healthy and IGF-1-deficient mice) with acute liver damage. suggesting that low doses of IGF-1. in acute liver damage. could be a feasible therapeutic option....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Hepatitis C
38,Adenoviruses cause a variety of diseases that range from mild to fatal in vulnerable patients. Its evolution occurs as a process of selection pressure; for example. genetic recombination generates intermediate strains that can be more infectious or pathogenic than parental strains. This study sought to determine the diversity of circulating adenoviruses in Paraguayan children less than 5 years of age hospitalized with acute lower respiratory infection. by using molecular biology and bioinformatics tools. though amplification of penton. hexon and fiber genes in 26 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirates. It was demonstrated the circulation of three species: B (4/26). C (21/26). and D (1/26). as well as recombination events corresponding to the HAdV-D isolate. with at least three different genotypes (D49. D9 y D15). The HAdV-D are associated with gastrointestinal or ocular diseases. and less commonly with respiratory infections. Recently. however. it has been reported changes in behavior of these viruses due to recombination. allowing them to expand their host cell repertoire. These data extend the knowledge about the genetic diversity of HAdV in Paraguay and strongly support the importance of genomic analysis using bioinformatics tools in epidemiological surveillance of emerging recombinant strains of HAdV....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,HIV/AIDS
39,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children. While survival rates for ALL have improved. central nervous system (CNS) relapse remains a significant cause of treatment failure and treatment-related morbidity. Accordingly. there is a need to identify more efficacious and less toxic CNS-directed leukemia therapies. Extensive research has demonstrated a critical role of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in leukemia development. maintenance. and chemoresistance. Moreover. therapies to disrupt mechanisms of BM microenvironment-mediated leukemia survival and chemoresistance represent new. promising approaches to cancer therapy. However. in direct contrast to the extensive knowledge of the BM microenvironment. the unique attributes of the CNS microenvironment that serve to make it a leukemia reservoir are not yet elucidated. Recent work has begun to define both the mechanisms by which leukemia cells migrate into the CNS and how components of the CNS influence leukemia biology to enhance survival. chemoresistance. and ultimately relapse. In addition to providing new insight into CNS relapse and leukemia biology. this area of investigation will potentially identify targetable mechanisms of leukemia chemoresistance and self-renewal unique to the CNS environment that will enhance both the durability and quality of the cure for ALL patients....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
40,RNA-sequencing of the patient's bone marrow detected fusion transcripts in which the coding sequence of the FAM53B gene (from 10q26) was fused to a genomic sequence (from 19q13) that mapped upstream of the SLC7A10 locus. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction together with Sanger sequencing verified the presence of this fusion transcript. The FAM53B fusion transcript is not expected to produce any chimeric protein. However. it may code for a truncated FAM53B protein consisting of the first 302 amino acids of FAM53B together with amino acids from the 19q13 sequence. Functionally. the truncated FAM53B would be similar to the protein encoded by the FAM53B sequence with accession no. BC031654.1 (FAM53B protein accession no. AAH31654.1). Furthermore. the truncated protein contains the entire conserved domain of the FAM53 protein family. The chromosome aberration t(10;19)(q26;q13) detected in this study was previously reported in a single case of ALL. in which it was also the sole karyotypic change. Both patients entered complete hematological and cytogenetic remission following treatment....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Lymphoma
41,Purpose ETV6/RUNX1(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). which is the most common genetic subtype of pediatric ALL. has a favorable prognosis. In this study. we analyzed the outcome of ETV6/RUNX1 (+) ALL patients treated at our institution with the aim of identifying significant prognostic variables. Materials and Methods Sixty-three patients were diagnosed with ETV6/RUNX1(+) ALL from 2005 to 2011. Prognostic variables studied included minimal residual disease (MRD) as detected by ETI/6/RUNX1(+) fusion. and the presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Results The 5-year event-free survival was 84.1 +/- 4.6%. with 10 patients relapsing at a median of 28.3 months from diagnosis for a 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse of 15.9 4.6%. Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence MRD. as detected by real-time quantitative-polymerase chain reaction or fluorescence in situ hybridization for ETV6/RUNX1 fusion at end of remission induction. and the presence of additional structural abnormalities of 12p (translocations or inversions) negatively affected outcome. Despite treatment such as allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. eight of the 10 relapsed patients died from disease progression for overall survival of 82.5 +/- 6.9%. Conclusion ETV6/RUNX1(+) ALL may be heterogeneous in terms of prognosis. and variables such as MRD at end of remission induction or additional structural abnormalities of 12p could define a subset of patients who are likely to have poor outcome....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Lymphoma
42,IntroductionThe translocation t(12;21)(p13;q22) resulting in the fusion gene ETV6-RUNX1. is the most frequent gene fusion in childhood B lymphoblastic leukemia. In the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL-2008 treatment protocol. treatment stratification in B-lineage ALL is based on results of minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). In this study. we determined whether RT-qPCR of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion transcript can be a reliable alternative for MRD analysis. MethodsSeventy-eight bone marrow samples from 29 children at diagnosis and day 15. 29. and 78 during treatment were analyzed for MRD with FACS and with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Fusion transcript MRD was defined as the ETV6-RUNX1/GUSB ratio at the follow-up time point (day 15/29/78) divided with the ETV6-RUNX1/GUSB ratio at diagnosis (%). ResultsMRD analysis with FACS and with RT-qPCR of ETV6-RUNX1 fusion transcript showed strong correlation. All cases showed concordant results at the treatment stratifying time points day 29 and day 78. when comparing the two methods with a cutoff set to 0.1%. ConclusionRT-qPCR is a valuable addition and could also be an alternative to FACS in cases where FACS is not achievable for MRD analysis....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
43,Glucocorticoids (GCs) induce apoptosis in lymphoid lineage cells and are therefore used in the therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and related malignancies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and the related mirtrons are similar to 22 nucleotide RNAs derived from polymerase-II transcripts and implicated in the control of essential biological functions. including apoptosis. Whether GCs regulate miRNA-encoding transcription units is unknown. We investigated miRNA/mirtron expression and GC regulation in 8 leukemia/lymphoma in vitro models and 13 ALL children undergoing systemic GC monotherapy using a combination of expression profiling techniques. real time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and northern blotting to detect mature miRNAs and/or their precursors. We found that mature miRNA regulations can be inferred from expression data of their host genes. Although a simple miRNA-initiated canonical pathway to GC-induced apoptosis or cell cycle arrest did not emerge. we identified several miRNAs/mirtrons that were regulated by GC in patients and cell lines. including the myeloid-specific miR-223 and the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest-inducing miR15 similar to 16 clusters. In an in vitro model. overexpression of miR15b similar to 16 mimics increased and silencing by miR15b similar to 16 inhibitors decreased GC sensitivity. Thus. the observed complex changes in miRNA/mirtron expression during GC treatment might contribute to the anti-leukemic GC effects in a cell context-dependent manner....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Cancer
44,Treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) over the past four decades remains mostly unchanged and the prognosis for the majority of patients remains poor. Most of the significant advances that have been observed are in defining cytogenetic abnormalities. as well as the genetic and epigenetic profiles of AML patients. While new cytogenetic and genetic aberrations such as the FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations are able to guide prognosis for the majority of patients with AML. outcomes are still dismal and relapse rates remain high. It is thought that relapse in AML is in part driven by minimal residual disease (MRD) that remains in the patient following treatment. Thus. there is a need for sensitive and objective methodology for MRD detection. Methodologies such as multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC). quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). digital PCR (dPCR). or next-generation sequencing (NGS) are being employed to evaluate their utility in MRD assessment. In this review. we will provide an overview of AML and the clinical utility of MRD measurement. We will discuss optimal timing to MRD measurement. the different approaches that are available. and efforts in the standardization across laboratories....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
45,The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has recently been implicated in leukaemic cell growth. tumour-associated angiogenesis and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We examined whether mTOR plays a role as regulator of growth and VEGF-expression in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Three mTOR-targeting drugs. rapamycin. everolimus (RAD001) and CCI-779. were applied. The effects of these drugs on growth. survival. apoptosis and VEGF expression in primary AML cells and various AML cell lines were examined. Growth of AML cells and AML-derived cell lines was assessed by (3)H-thymidine incorporation. survival was examined by light- and electron microscopy. by Tunel assay and by AnnexinV-staining. and the expression of VEGF by Northern blotting. RT-PCR and ELISA. Rapamycin was found to counteract growth in the AML cell lines U937 and KG1a as well as in primary AML cells in 14/18 patients examined. The effects of rapamycin and its derivatives were dose-dependent (IC(50): 10 pM-100 nM). It was also found that exposure to mTOR-targeting drugs resulted in apoptosis and in decreased expression of VEGF in leukaemic cells. mTOR-targeting drugs exert antileukaemic effects on AML cells in vitro through multiple actions. including direct inhibition of proliferation. induction of apoptosis and suppression of VEGF. Based on this study and other studies. mTOR can be regarded as a potential drug target in AML....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Cancer
46,Background/Purpose: Mutations in the tet oncogene family member 2 gene (TET2) are frequently found in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Reports of TET2 mutations in children are limited. We assessed the prevalence of TET2 mutations in Taiwanese children with AML and analyzed their prognosis. Methods: Between 1997 and 2010. a total of 69 consecutive children with AML were enrolled at the National Taiwan University Hospital. The analysis for TET2 mutations was performed using direct sequencing. Clinical characteristics and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients with and without TET2 alterations. Results: Intronic and missense mutations were identified. No nonsense or frameshift mutations were observed. Two putative disease-causing missense mutations (S609C and A1865G) were identified in one patient. We estimated the prevalence of TET2 mutations in the current patient population to be 1.4%. The most common polymorphism was I1762V (45%). followed by V218M (12%). P29R (6%). and F868L (6%). Patients with polymorphism I1762V had an increased 10-year survival rate compared with patients without I1762V (48.4% vs. 25.7%. p = 0.049) by Chi-square test; OS was not different when examined using the Kaplan-Meier method (p = 0.104). Conclusion: The prevalence of TET2 mutations in children with AML compared with adults with AML was lower and less complex. Patient prognosis associated with TET2 mutations in children requires further investigation. Copyright (C) 2015. Formosan Medical Association.

47,Several studies have reported previously that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may express WT1 detected by RT-PCR and/or Northern blotting. The diagnostic utility of WT1 expression in AML using immunohistochemistry has not been reported previously. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 55 AML. 12 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). and 10 normal bone marrow specimens were immunostained for WT1 (anti-N terminus antibody). 22/55 AML cases (40%) demonstrated nuclear immunopositivity for WT1. including 20/47 bone marrow trephines and 2/4 granulocytic sarcomas. All the ALL and normal bone marrow specimens were negative. A significant proportion of AML expresses nuclear immunostaining for WT1. a finding that has only been described previously in Wilms' tumor and desmoplastic small round cell tumor. This finding is important for the correct interpretation of immunohistochemical findings in the diagnosis of "small round cell'' tumors of childhood. especially in cases of extramedullary deposits of AML. in which traditional myeloid markers may be negative....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Cancer
48,The karyotype is critical for the evaluation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at diagnosis. Cytogenetic abnormalities detected in AML are one of the most powerful independent prognostic factors. It impacts on the choice of treatment in clinical trials. All chromosomes can be targeted. common chromosomal abnormalities are recurrent and may be associated with a cytological well-defined type. In 40% of the cases. the karyotype is normal and must be associated with molecular biology studies that can refine the prognosis. The usefulness of the karyotype is more limited during the follow-up of the patient due to its limited sensitivity. but it is still useful in the clinical management of relapse. Since 2001. the WHO (World Health Organization) classification of hematological malignancies integrates cytogenetic data in the classification of AML. Karyotype is therefore mandatory in the diagnosis of AML....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
49,Purpose: To correlate visual acuity outcomes and clinical features with quantitative PCR DNA copy number in patients with acute retinal necrosis (ARN). Methods: Retrospective. consecutive case series. Results: In total. 14 eyes of 13 patients were diagnosed with ARN. based on the American Uveitis Society criteria. and were followed for a mean of 324.5 days (median 250.5 days. SD +/- 214 days). Anterior chamber fluid analyzed by quantitative PCR identified viral DNA in 11 of 14 eyes (78.5%). Varicella zoster virus (VZV) was identified in seven eyes (50%) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) in four eyes (28.5%). Mean DNA copy number was 7.9 x 10(6)/mL (median 2.10 x 10(6)/mL. range: 0-5.60 x 10(7)/mL). Eyes with quantitative PCR DNA copy number of 5.0 x 10(6)/mL (n = 6 eyes) had worse baseline visual acuity (logMAR 1.48 +/- 0.71 vs 0.94 +/- 0.76. p = 0.196) and final visual acuity (logMAR 2.10 +/- 0.60 vs 0.82 +/- 0.81. p = 0.007) compared with patients with a DNA copy number <5.0 x 10(6)/mL (n = 8 eyes). Patients with a DNA copy number of 5.0 x 10(6)/mL were more likely to have at least 5 clock hours of retinitis on funduscopic exam (p = 0.03) and developed retinal detachment more frequently (p = 0.08). Conclusions: Quantitative DNA copy number of 5.0 x 10(6)/mL is associated with more extensive retinitis. worse visual acuity. and development of retinal detachment in patients with acute retinal necrosis....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,HIV/AIDS
50,This review summarizes present evidence for the role of YKL-40 in the diagnosis. prognosis and cause of cardiovascular and alcoholic liver disease. The question of whether YKL-40 is merely a marker or a causal factor in the development of cardiovascular and liver disease is addressed. with emphasis on the Mendelian randomization design. The Mendelian randomization approach uses genetic variants associated with lifelong high plasma YKL-40 levels that are largely unconfounded and not prone to reverse causation. Thus. the approach mimics a controlled double-blind randomized trial. but it uses genetic variants rather than a drug and placebo. and like a blinded trial. it allows inference about causality. Moreover. the review also covers background on the molecular biology and functions of YKL-40. YKL-40 levels in healthy individuals and reference range. and the role of YKL-40 as a biomarker of cardiovascular and alcoholic liver disease. YKL-40 is a plasma protein named after its three N-terminal amino acids. Y (tyrosine). K (lysine) and L (leucine). and its molecular weight of 40kDa. It is produced by local inflammatory cells in inflamed tissues. such as lipid-laden macrophages inside the vessel wall and perhaps also hepatic stellate cells. Observational studies show that plasma YKL-40 levels are elevated in patients with cardiovascular and liver disease and are associated with disease severity and prognosis. Furthermore. elevated plasma YKL-40 levels in apparently healthy individuals are associated with a 2-fold increased risk of future ischemic stroke and venous thromboembolism. but not with myocardial infarction. suggesting that YKL-40 could play a role in the formation of embolisms rather than atherosclerosis per se. Further. elevated YKL-40 levels combined with excessive alcohol consumption are associated with 10-years risk of alcoholic liver cirrhosis of up to 7%. suggesting that YKL-40 can be used as a strong noninvasive marker of predicting alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Importantly. in Mendelian randomization studies. genetically elevated plasma YKL-40 levels were not associated with risk of cardiovascular and alcoholic liver disease. thus suggesting that plasma YKL-40 does not play a causal role in the development of these diseases. Despite this. plasma YKL-40 levels may play a role in disease progression after diagnosis. and inhibition of YKL-40 activity might be a novel therapy in some cardiovascular and liver diseases....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Heart Disease
51,Acyclovir resistance is rarely seen in herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I encephalitis. Prevalence rates vary between 0.5 % in immunocompetent patients (Christophers et al. 1998; Fife et al. 1994) and 3.5-10 % in immunocompromised patients (Stranska et al. 2005). We report a 45-year-old. immunocompetent (negative HIV antigen/antibody testing). female patient. without previous illness who developed-after a febrile prodromal stage-aphasia and psychomotor slowing. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) showed right temporal and insular T2-hyperintense lesions with spreading to the contralateral temporal lobe. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis yielded lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein level. Polymerase chain reaction testing for HSV type I showed a positive result in repeat lumbar puncture. HSV type I encephalitis was diagnosed and intravenous acyclovir treatment was initiated (750 mg t.i.d.). Acyclovir treatment was intensified to 1000 mg t.i.d.. due to clinical deterioration. ongoing pleocytosis and progression on cMRI 5 days after initiation of antiviral therapy. In parallel. acyclovir resistance testing showed mutation of thymidine kinase gene at position A156V prompting foscarnet therapy (60 mg t.i.d.). Patient's condition improved dramatically over 2 weeks. Acyclovir resistance is rare but should be considered in case of clinical worsening of patient's condition. To our knowledge. this is the first report of acyclovir resistance in HSV type I encephalitis of an immunocompetent and previously healthy patient in Austria....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,HIV/AIDS
52,Introduction: The recent approval of adalimumab (trade name Humira. Abbvie inc.) by the FDA for the treatment of noninfectious intermediate. posterior and panuveitis marks the first on label' non-corticosteroid drug available to ophthalmologists. Immunomodulatory (IMT) and biologic agents have long been shown to be effective in inducing remission of chronic uveitis but have remained as orphan drugs due to lack of financial incentive and perceived need. Areas covered: Here we provide detail into the background and use of adalimumab for uveitic patients. Topics include pharmacology. therapeutic indications and usage. dosage. drug safety. physician monitoring. side effects and adverse events. Expert opinion: We see the approval of adalimumab for uveitis as an important milestone improving upon the accepted standards of care for patients with this severe. sight threatening disease. We implore medical professionals to consider the use of IMT and biologic treatments for patients with recurrent non-infectious uveitis. referring to ocular immunology and uveitis specialists when necessary....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Ankylosing Spondylitis
53,Aims: Trophoblast fusion in the placenta is prerequisite to successful pregnancy and the pathological conditions related to it. The presence of syncytin-1. is not sufficient to explain the complete event and ADAM12 is a major co-player candidate. Via differential splicing. the ADAM12 gene produces a short and a long form. being the ADAM12-S and the ADAM12-L respectively. Methods and results: We investigated the localisation of both variants in the human placenta using whole mount in situ hybridisation. immunohistochemistry and Northern blotting in 1st (n = 8) and 3rd (n = 8) trimester placentae and in the case of NB in several cell lines. In Northern blotting. 1st and 3rd trimester placentae were positive for the ADAM12-S and Bewo. 293HEK. JAR. leucocytes. macrophages. 1st and 3rd trimester placentae were positive for ADAM12-L. In whole mount in situ hybridisation. the 1st and 3rd trimester placental syncytium was positive for both variants. In immunohistochemistry. ADAM12-L localised in the cytotrophoblast of both 1st and 3rd trimester placentae. while ADAM12-S localised in the complete syncytium. often including the cytotrophoblast. Conclusion: The different localisation of ADAM12-S and ADAM12-L indicates a possible different role making ADAM12-L a candidate for the fusion event. while the syncytial localisation of the ADAM12-S makes it a candidate for cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions between the placental syncytium and the maternal interface.

54,This paper proposes an adaptive controller with an improved high-frequency injection method for sensorless synchronous reluctance drive systems. A mathematical model is presented to show that the use of a high-frequency injection method that takes into account the effects of unequal mutual-inductances and the influence of speed reduces the rotor position estimation error. The adaptive speed control algorithm offers improved transient performance in comparison to typical proportional-integral (PI) controllers that are employed in sensorless drive systems. To demonstrate the viability. the proposed adaptive controller and the modified high-frequency injection method are implemented using a TMS-320F-28335A digital signal processor to control a 500 W prototype synchronous reluctance motor drive. Experimental results are presented to show that the transient. load disturbance. and tracking responses of the proposed drive system are superior in comparison to a drive that uses a PI controller. Both experimental and theoretical analyses clearly indicate that the proposed high-frequency injection method with an adaptive speed-loop controller offers improved performance in adjustable speed synchronous reluctance drive systems....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
55,In this paper. a current sensorless adaptive secondary-side control is proposed for the series resonant converter (SRC). making it a good candidate for MHz 48 voltage regulators. By means of varying ac equivalent resistance. the output voltage regulation is achieved by controlling the duty cycle of the synchronous MOSFET. By taking advantage of the secondary-side control. SRCs can operate under zero-voltage switching at any input voltage and load conditions. A current sensorless adaptive digital control is proposed to control the current-type synchronous MOSFETs. which automatically compensates the delay caused by the current-sensor circuit and the gate driver. and also eliminates the current sensor in the power path. A hybrid control strategy is introduced to overcome the efficiency degradation caused by the secondary-side control....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
56,A recursive smoothing filter employing a bank of fading-memory polynomial sub-filters is presented. Variance estimates are used to mix the outputs of the sub-filters. imparting variable gain and phase characteristics that permit it to automatically adapt to signal parameter changes. The proposed adaptive technique does not involve the estimation of plant parameters; therefore. it may be used in both open-loop and closed-loop configurations. In open-loop estimation problems. variable gain/bandwidth allows it to reduce the impact of random errors caused by sensor noise and the impact of bias errors caused by model mismatch during ` maneuvers'. In feedback control problems. variable phase/delay allows it to act as a lag filter for an improved steady-state response (i.e. greater noise attenuation) and act as a lead filter. or a proportionalderivative controller. for an improved transient response (i.e. increased closed-loop damping) for input discontinuities.

57,In this paper. a novel mixed iterative adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm is developed to solve the optimal battery energy management and control problem in smart residential microgrid systems. Based on the data of the load and electricity rate. two iterations are constructed. which are P-iteration and V-iteration. respectively. The V-iteration is implemented based on value iteration. which aims to obtain the iterative control law sequence in each period. The P-iteration is implemented based on policy iteration. which updates the iterative value function according to the iterative control law sequence. Properties of the developed mixed iterative ADP algorithm are analyzed. It is shown that the iterative value function is monotonically nonincreasing and converges to the solution of the Bellman equation. In each iteration. it is proven that the performance index function is finite under the iterative control law sequence. Finally. numerical results and comparisons are given to illustrate the performance of the developed algorithm....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Control engineering
58,This paper proposes a dimmable energy-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) driver for applications in interior lighting. High efficiency is achieved by an adaptive voltage regulation. which minimizes power losses in the linear current regulator. A digital control mechanism employing a resistive digital-to-analog converter for feeding the analog feedback input of a dc-dc converter is introduced. It is shown that the digital control methodology gives maximum design flexibility and enhances control over regulation speed and stability. In an experimental setup. the proposed concept is verified and evaluated. Operating at an input voltage of 24 V. the LED driver provides a relatively wide output voltage range of 3.5-38 V. Output current is regulated to 700 mA with a steady-state precision of more than 98.8%. whereas pulsewidth modulation dimming with a frequency of 1 kHz and shortest on-time of 4 mu s is employed. A peak efficiency of the complete system of 93.9% is achieved....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
59,Environmental governance systems are under greater pressure to adapt and to cope with increased social and ecological uncertainty from stressors like climate change. We review principles of social cognition and decision making that shape and constrain how environmental governance systems adapt. We focus primarily on the interplay between key decision makers in society and legal systems. We argue that adaptive governance must overcome three cooperative dilemmas to facilitate adaptation: (1) encouraging collaborative problem solving. (2) garnering social acceptance and commitment. and (3) cultivating a culture of trust and tolerance for change and uncertainty. However. to do so governance systems must cope with biases in people's decision making that cloud their judgment and create conflict. These systems must also satisfy people's fundamental needs for self-determination. fairness. and security. ensuring that changes to environmental governance are perceived as legitimate. trustworthy. and acceptable. We discuss the implications of these principles for common governance solutions (e.g.. public participation. enforcement) and conclude with methodological recommendations. We outline how scholars can investigate the social cognitive principles involved in cases of adaptive governance....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
60,Adjuvants are substances added to vaccines to improve their immunogenicity. Used for more than 80years. aluminum. the first adjuvant in human vaccines. proved insufficient to develop vaccines that could protect against new challenging pathogens such as HIV and malaria. New adjuvants and new combinations of adjuvants (Adjuvant Systems) have opened the door to the delivery of improved and new vaccines against re-emerging and difficult pathogens. Adjuvant Systems concept started through serendipity. The access to new developments in technology. microbiology and immunology have been instrumental for the dicephering of what they do and how they do it. This knowledge opens the door to more rational vaccine design with implications for developing new and better vaccines....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,HIV/AIDS
61,In recent years. immunotherapy has gained renewed interest as an alternative therapeutic approach for solid tumors. Its premise is based on harnessing the power of the host immune system to destroy tumor cells. Development of immune-mediated therapies. such as vaccines. adoptive transfer of autologous immune cells. and stimulation of host immunity by targeting tumor-evasive mechanisms have advanced cancer immunotherapy. In addition. studies on innate immunity and mechanisms of immune evasion have enhanced our understanding on the immunology of liver cancer. Preclinical and clinical studies with immune-mediated therapies have shown potential benefits in patients with liver cancer. In this review. we summarize current knowledge and recent developments in tumor immunology by focusing on two main primary liver cancers: hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Cancer
62,Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are thought to be predominant proteases and protease inhibitors involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) through their ability to remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) in response to inflammatory stimuli and by their immunomodulating effects. An imbalance between MMPs and TIMPs has been linked with acute and chronic inflammation and aberrant tissue remodeling. as seen in IBD. Moreover. recurrent phases of tissue destruction and subsequent tissue repair can cause serious complications in IBD patients such as fistulas and fibrosis. The aims of this review are (i) to summarize current literature on genetic association. mRNA. and protein expression studies with regard to MMPs and TIMPs in IBD patients and various animal models. including those with transgenic and knockout mice; (ii) to compare biochemical and molecular biological data in humans with those obtained in animal model studies and (iii) to critically evaluate and translate how this knowledge may be used in practical terms to understand better the pathophysiology and mechanisms operating in IBD and to apply this for improvement of clinical outcomes at diagnostic. prognostic and therapeutic levels....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Crohn's Disease
63,CRISPR-Cas are self-/nonself-discriminating systems found in prokaryotic cells. They represent a remarkable example of molecular memory that is hereditarily transmitted. Their discovery can be considered as one of the first fruits of the systematic exploration of prokaryotic genomes. Although this genomic feature was serendipitously discovered in molecular biology studies. it was the availability of multiple complete genomes that shed light about their role as a genetic immune system. Here we tell the story of how this discovery originated and was slowly and painstakingly advanced to the point of understating the biological role of what initially was just an odd genomic feature....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Immunology
64,In this chapter has been proposed a robust sensorless cascade control scheme for a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) drive. A Discrete Time Variable Structure Control (DTVSC) is considered and the rotor position and speed are obtained through an Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF). The performance of the filter is improved by an on line adjustment of the input and measurement noise covariances obtained by a suitably defined estimation algorithm. The proposed solution is experimentally tested on a commercial PMSM drive equipped with a control system based on a floating point Digital Signal Processor (DSP)....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
65,This paper presents a power system harmonic elimination using the mixed adaptive linear neural network and variable step-size leaky least mean square (ADALINE-VSSLLMS) control algorithm based active power filter (APF). The weight vector of ADALINE along with the variable step-size parameter and leakage coefficient of the VSSLLMS algorithm are automatically adjusted to eliminate harmonics from the distorted load current. For all iteration. the VSSLLMS algorithm selects a new rate of convergence for searching and runs the computations. The adopted shunt-hybrid APF (SHAPF) consists of an APF and a series of 7th tuned passive filter connected to each phase. The performance of the proposed ADALINE-VSSLLMS control algorithm employed for SHAPF is analyzed through a simulation in a MATLAB/Simulink environment. Experimental results of a real-time prototype validate the efficacy of the proposed control algorithm....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Single-phase electric power
66,The proposed frequency-locked loop (FLL) utilizes the flat frequency response characteristics of the moving window filter (MWF) in closed-loop and adaptive sampling pulse adjustment for capacitance measurement. An operational amplifier (op-amp) based relaxation oscillator generates a square wave whose fundamental sine wave is extracted by MWF. Then. the fundamental sine wave is tracked by the FLL to estimate its frequency which is inversely proportional to the unknown capacitance. The FLL employs another MWF to track the center frequency and its variation due to capacitance. The MWF offers an almost flat frequency response around the center frequency in closed-loop. However. the small magnitude and phase errors observed in the flat frequency response had been corrected by adjusting the sampling pulses adaptively. Experimental investigation demonstrates the capabilities of the scheme for wider and accurate capacitance measurement....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing

68,In comparison with conventional operational amplifier. ring amplifier can achieve better power efficiency for switched capacitor circuits. However. the cascade-inverter architecture of ring amplifier may suffer from undesirable oscillation which has a great impact on transient stability. This paper presents a latched-based ring amplifier which is capable of decreasing the probability of oscillation. Besides. two auto-zero schemes are employed in different pipelined stages to reduce the common-mode voltage offset and to increase the stability. The prototype ADC was fabricated in a 90-nm CMOS technology. The measured SNDR and SFDR are 52.06 dB and 63.15 dB. respectively. for a Nyquist frequency input sampled at 35 MS/s. and the ADC consumes 3.65 mW....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
69,Background/Aims: The organization of actin cytoskeleton in podocyte foot processes plays a critical role in the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. The cAMP pathway is an important regulator of the actin network assembly in cells. However. the role of the cAMP pathway in podocytes is not well understood. Type 1 adenylate cyclase (Adcy1). previously thought to be specific for neuronal tissue. is a member of the family of enzymes that catalyses the formation of cAMP. In this study. we characterized the expression and role of Adcy1 in the kidney. Methods: Expression of Adcy1 was studied by RT-PCR. Northern blotting and in situ hybridization. The role of Adcy1 in podocytes was investigated by analyzing Adcy1 knockout mice (Adcy1-/-). Results and Conclusion: Adcy1 is expressed in the kidney specifically by podocytes. In the kidney. Adcy1 does not have a critical role in normal physiological functioning as kidney histology and function are normal in Adcy1-/-mice. However. albumin overload resulted in severe albuminuria in Adcy1-/-mice. whereas wild-type control mice showed only mild albumin leakage to urine. In conclusion. we have identified Adcy1 as a novel podocyte signaling protein that seems to have a role in compensatory physiological processes in the glomerulus. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG.

70,The endogenous oxytocin system plays a vital role in facilitating parturition. lactation and social interaction in humans and other mammals. It also impacts on a number of important endocrine. immune and neurotransmitter systems. A well-regulated oxytocin system has been proposed to increase resilience. and therefore reduce the likelihood of an individual developing mental illness or substance dependence. This review discusses the adverse external influences that can modulate oxytocin receptor and protein levels and impact on substance use and mental health. The paper highlights the impact of adversity such as poor maternal care. parental substance use and child abuse or neglect. We review clinical and preclinical data on the impact of adversity on the basis of the time of exposure from infancy and early childhood. to adolescence. adulthood to older age. Previous research suggests that dysregulation of the endogenous oxytocin system may be implicated in determining susceptibility to stress. anxiety. addiction and mental health conditions. The impact of external influence seems to be strongest in specific time periods where the system shows experience-based development or natural fluctuations in oxytocin levels. Interventions that target the oxytocin system during or soon after exposure to adversity may prove protective. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health. Inc.

71,Background and aims Deficits in social cognitive abilities including emotion recognition and theory of mind (ToM) can play a significant role in interpersonal difficulties observed in alcohol use disorder (AUD). This meta-analysis aims to estimate mean effect sizes of deficits in social cognition inAUD and examines the effects of demographic and clinical confounding factors on the variability of effect sizes across studies. Methods A literature review was conducted on research reports published from January 1990 to January 2016. Twenty-five studies investigating ToM and facial emotion recognition performances of 756 individuals with AUD and 681 healthy controls were selected after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Weighted effect sizes (d) were calculated for ToM. decoding and reasoning aspects of ToM. total facial emotion recognition and recognition of each of six basic emotions. Results Facial emotion recognition was significantly impaired [d=0.65.95% confidence interval (CI)=0.42-0.89]. particularly for disgust and anger. AUDwas also associated with deficits in ToM (d=0.58. 95% CI=0.36-0.81). These deficits were evident in tasks measuring both decoding (d=0.46. 95% CI=0.19-0.73) and reasoning (d=0.72. 95% CI=0.37-1.06) aspects of ToM. The longer duration of alcohol misuse and more depressive symptoms were associated with more severe deficits in recognition of facial emotions. Conclusions Alcohol use disorder appears to be associated with significant impairment in facial emotion recognition and theory of mind....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
72,Aims To investigate whether: (1) childmaltreatment is associated with life-time cannabis use. early-onset cannabis use. daily cannabis use and DSM-IV cannabis abuse in young adulthood; and (2) behaviour problems. tobacco use and alcohol use at age 14 are associated with cannabis use. Design Birth cohort using linked government agency child protection data to define exposure to child maltreatment. Setting The Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy in Brisbane. Australia. Participants Of the original cohort of 7223 mother and child pairs. obtained from consecutive presentations for prenatal care at a hospital serving a cross-section of the community. 3778 (52.3%) of the young people participated at age 21 years. Measurements Exposure to child maltreatment was established by substantiated government agency reports. Cannabis outcomes were by self-report questionnaire and Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)-Auto at age 21. Associations were adjusted for a range of potential confounders. Additional adjustment was carried out for variables measured at age 14-youth behaviour problems [Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)]. tobacco use and alcohol use. Findings After adjustment. substantiated child maltreatment was associated with any life-time cannabis use [odds ratio (OR) = 1.60. 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08-2.39]. cannabis use prior to age 17 (OR = 2.47. 95 % CI = 1.67-3.65). daily cannabis use (OR = 2.68. 95% CI = 1.49-4.81) and DSM-IV cannabis abuse/dependence (OR = 1.72. 95% CI = 1.07-2.77). Externalizing behaviour and tobacco and alcohol use at age 14 were associated significantly with almost all cannabis outcomes (P < 0.05). with internalizing behaviour associated inversely (P < 0.05). Conclusions Children in Australia who are documented as having been maltreated are more likely to go on to use cannabis before the age of 17. use cannabis as an adult. use cannabis daily and meet DSM-IV criteria for cannabis dependence. Externalizing behaviour in adolescence appears partly to mediate the association with adult cannabis use....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Addiction
73,The purpose of this project was to examine the emotional health and wellbeing of Canadian caregivers of persons with significant mental health or addictions problems. We assessed the emotional health of caregivers by care-receiver condition type (i.e. mental health or addictions vs. physical or other health problems). levels of caregiver stress and methods particularly for reducing stress among caregivers of persons with mental health or addictions disorders. Weighted cross-sectional data from the 2012 General Social Survey (Caregiving and Care Receiving) were modelled using weighted descriptive and logistic regression analyses to examine levels of stress and the emotional health and well-being of caregivers by care-receiver condition type. Caregivers of persons with mental health or addictions problems were more likely to report that caregiving was very stressful and that they felt depressed. tired. worried or anxious. overwhelmed; lonely or isolated; short-tempered or irritable; and resentful because of their caregiving responsibilities. The results of this study suggest that mental health and addictions caregivers may experience disparate stressors and require varying services and supports relative to caregivers of persons with physical or other health conditions....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Depression
74,Defined as sexually explicit material that elicits erotic thoughts. feelings. and behaviours. internet pornography is a prevalent form of media that may facilitate problematic use and craving for engagement. Research suggests that superordinate cognitions and information processing. such as desire thinking and metacognition. are central to the activation and escalation of craving in addictive behaviours. The current study aimed to contribute to the literature by testing the proposed metacognitive model of desire thinking and craving in a sample of problematic pornography users. while revising the model by incorporating negative affect. From a theoretical perspective. environmental cues trigger positive metacognitions about desire thinking that directly influence desire thinking. resulting in the escalation of craving. negative metacognitions. and negative affect. Participants were recruited via an online survey and screened for problematic internet pornography use. Path analyses were used to investigate relationships among the aforementioned constructs in a final sample of 191 participants. Consistent with previous research. results of this study validated the existence of metacognitive processes in the activation of desire thinking and escalation of craving. while indicating that desire thinking has the potential to influence negative affect. Additionally. results supported the role of significant indirect relationships between constructs within the revised model of metacognition. desire thinking. and psychopathology. Collectively. the findings demonstrate the clinical value of a metacognitive conceptualisation of problematic pornography use. Exploring the metacognitive mechanisms that underpin problematic internet pornography use may give rise to the development of new treatment and relapse prevention strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

75,In many low-to-mid power applications. critical mode boost power factor corrector converters are widely used because of its low switching loss and simple control. However. near the zero crossing of the input line voltage. an input current distortion and a low power factor are caused by delayed switching period and negative input currents. Generally. an additional on-time method according to the input voltage is used to compensate the input current distortion. However. a detailed quantitative analysis for the exact additional on time has not been studied till now. In this paper. the explicit form of the optimized additional on time has been obtained using a quantitative analysis and the advantage of the digital control. From a state trajectory and "net input charge" analysis. it is shown that the optimized on time should be related to not only the input voltage. but also the output power. Also. in order to improve the efficiency in a high input and light load condition. circulating currents are reduced in the inevitable dead angle with a gate turning-off technique. By using digital control. the optimized additional on time and the gate turn-off technique have been implemented with the 90-230 V-rms input and 380 V/200 W output prototype....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
76,For Siewert type II adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEJ). the optimal surgical approach and extent of lymph nodes dissection remain controversial. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been reported to be available for identifying lymph node micrometastasis (LNMM) in patients with AEJ. This was a prospective case series of patients who underwent R0 resection and lower mediastinal lymphadenectomy from January 2010 to June 2015 in Fujian Medical University Union Hospital for Siewert type II AEJ. The outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 1325 lymph nodes were collected from 49 patients. grouped into 3 groups: lower mediastinal. paracardial. and abdominal. The former 2 groups were examined by monoclonal antibodies against Ber-Ep4 and CD44v6. The incidence of LNMM in mediastinal group was 37% (18/49) for Ber-Ep4 and 33% (16/49) for CD44v6. While in routine histological diagnosis. the number of patients with the positive lymph nodes was 7 (14%). When combining IHC with histopathology (HE) staining. the incidence of positive mediastinal lymph nodes was increased to 24%. with a total number of 37 lymph nodes from 28 patients (57%). Micrometastases indicated by Ber-Ep4 and CD44v6 were associated with the depth of tumor invasion (P=0.020 and 0.037. respectively). histopathological nodal status (P=0.024 and 0.01. respectively). and Lauren classification (P=0.038 and. respectively). Expression of CD44v6 and Ber-Ep4 was positively correlated (r=0.643. P<0.001). The 3- and 5-year survival rates for all patients were 66% and 50%. respectively. The patients with LNMM had a lower 3-year survival rate of 51%. compared to 80% from no LNMM group; 5-year survival rate was also lower in LNMM group. which is 29% versus 68% (P=0.006) in the no LNMM group. Patients with positive Ber-Ep4 cells had a lower survival. but not statistically significant (P=0.058). CD44v6-positive group had a significantly reduced survival (P<0.001). In patients group with negative lower mediastinal lymph nodes. patients without LNMM obtained a significant survival benefit (P=0.021). Our study demonstrated that routine test for LNMM is necessary for patients with negative lymph nodes. As a positive prognostic factor. thorough lower mediastinal lymphadenectomy in an invasive approach should be considered when necessary. Ber-Ep4 and CD44v6 were shown to be great markers for detecting LNMM....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
77,Aims: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is known as causative for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oropharynx. but is also found not infrequently in carcinomas of the sinonasal tract. Recently. a subset of these carcinomas was recognized to harbour HPV33 and have a significant morphological overlap with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). a rare and aggressive carcinoma originating in the minor salivary glands. Termed 'HPV-related carcinoma with ACC-like features'. only nine cases have been reported. To clarify the occurrence of these tumours we screened a large material for the presence of HPV-related ACC-like carcinoma. The identified tumours were characterized immunohistochemically and with fluorescence in-situ hybridization. and clinicopathological information for all cases is presented. Methods and results: Forty-seven candidate cases were screened for presence of HPV. Six cases were identified and genotyped as HPV types 33. 35. and 56. All six cases had areas of dysplastic mucosal lining and showed remarkable heterogeneous morphologies. MYB. MYBL1. and NFIB genes were intact and. interestingly. staining for MYB protein was largely negative in contrast to what was found in ACC. One patient experienced a local recurrence 11 years after initial treatment and the remaining five patients were alive without evidence of disease. Conclusion: We report six new cases of HPV-related ACC-like carcinoma and found that. although in a small material. the prognosis for these patients seems more favourable than for ACC. For the distinction between ACC and HPV-related ACC-like carcinoma. p16. MYB immunohistochemistry or investigation of MYB.

78,The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) and its receptor. chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis (AD). Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to measure the protein and mRNA expression of CXCL12 and CXCR4 in eutopic endometrial and ectopic foci tissue samples. Samples from a total of 36 patients with AD (study group) were compared with endometrial tissue samples from 33 patients who underwent uterine fibroids surgery (control group) during the same period. All data are presented as the mean +/- standard deviation and were analyzed with SPSS software (version 16.0). Analysis of variance was used for between group analysis and pairwise comparison was performed using Fisher's least significant difference post hoc test. The results of the present study revealed that CXCL12 and CXCR4 protein expression was significantly increased in ectopic foci tissue compared with eutopic endometrial tissue samples from patients with AD. CXCL12 and CXCR4 protein expression in ectopic foci and eutopic endometrial tissue samples were significantly increased compared with the control group (P< 0.05 for between group comparisons). No significant differences were identified in CXCL12 and CXCR4 protein expression between the proliferative and secretory phases within each group. Furthermore. CXCL12 and CXCR4 mRNA expression was significantly increased in ectopic foci tissue and eutopic endometrial tissue compared with the control group (P< 0.05 for between group comparisons). CXCL12 mRNA expression was markedly increased in ectopic foci tissue compared with eutopic endometrial tissue of patients with AD. The expression of CXCR4 mRNA was significantly increased in eutopic endometrial tissue compared with ectopic foci tissue and the control group (P< 0.05 for between group comparisons). No significant differences were identified in CXCL12 and CXCR4 mRNA expression between proliferative and secretory phase within each group. In conclusion. CXCL12 and CXCR4 may induce the ectopia. and promote the spread and localized growth of endometrial cells in the development of AD....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
79,Objective: We investigated the expression and potential roles of interleukin (IL)-2. IL-4. IL-6. IL-10. IL-17A. IL-37. Interferon (IFN)-gamma. and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) in patients with adenomyosis. Materials and methods: This prospective study examined 16 women with histologically proven adenomyosis and 52 women without adenomyosis. all of whom were undergoing a hysterectomy for non-endometrial pathology at the Department of Gynaecology. the First Hospital of Jilin University. Changchun. China. from December 2011 to September 2012. Serum samples were collected from the patients. and the concentrations of serum IL-2. IL-4. IL-6. IL-10. IL-17A. IL-37. IFN-gamma. and TNF were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). We then calculated specificity and sensitivity of cytokines. taking Cancer Antigen (CA) 125 as a reference. distinguishing cases from controls by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The correlation between individual cytokines and CA 125 was also analysed. Results: IL-37 was detectable in 69.2% and the other cytokines in 30.8% of sera samples from the 52 controls. All the eight cytokines were detectable in the sera samples from 16 patients with adenomyosis. Significantly higher levels of serum IL-37 and IL-10 and significantly lower levels of serum IL-17A and TNF were detected in adenomyosis patients when compared with controls (p< 0.05). Conclusions: Serum levels of IL-10. IL-17A.

80,Objectives: Inflammatory response and cytokine activation are markedly stimulated in skeletal muscle during various conditions. Interleukin-6 (IL-6). a pro-inflammatory cytokine. has pleiotropic effects on skeletal muscle. Adenosine. released by all cell types. binds to a class of G protein-coupled receptors to induce various skeletal muscle effects. The aim of this work was to investigate whether activation of adenosine receptors. particularly adenosine A2B receptors. could stimulate IL-6 gene expression in rat L6 skeletal muscle cells. Materials and Methods: The rat L6 skeletal muscle cells were cultured in 25 cm2 flasks. These differentiated cells were treated and then quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Probe-based) was used to analyze IL-6 gene expression level among different treatment conditions. Results: Adenosine-5'-N-ethyluronamide (NECA). a stable adenosine analogue. concentration-and time-dependently stimulates IL-6 gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. The effect of NECA is inhibited by a selective adenosine A2B receptor antagonist. PSB 603. By using cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-arising reagent forskolin. cAMP is found to be involved in the up-regulation of IL-6 induction. Conclusion: Here. a novel relationship between adenosine and IL-6 up-regulation has been demonstrated for the first time; IL-6 up-regulation induced by NECA is mediated by adenosine A2B receptor activation in skeletal muscle and is dependent on mainly a cAMP pathway. Adenosine A2B receptors are. thus. potentially important pharmacological targets in treating inflammation and related diseases in skeletal muscle tissues....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Rheumatoid Arthritis
81,Adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette proteins constitute a large family of active transporters through extracellular and intracellular membranes. Increased drug efflux based on adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette protein activity is related to the development of cancer cell chemoresistance. Several articles have focused on adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette gene expression profiles ( signatures). based on the expression of all 49 human adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette genes. in individual tumor types and reported connections to established clinicopathological features. The aim of this study was to test our theory about the existence of adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette gene expression profiles common to multiple types of tumors. which may modify tumor progression and provide clinically relevant information. Such general adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette profiles could constitute a new attribute of carcinogenesis. Our combined cohort consisted of tissues from 151 cancer patients- breast. colorectal. and pancreatic carcinomas. Standard protocols for RNA isolation and quantitative real- time polymerase chain reaction were followed. Gene expression data from individual tumor types as well as a merged tumor dataset were analyzed by bioinformatics tools. Several general adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette profiles. with differences in gene functions. were established and shown to have significant relations to clinicopathological features such as tumor size. histological grade. or clinical stage. Genes ABCC7. A3. A8. A12. and C8 prevailed among the most upregulated or downregulated ones. In conclusion. the results supported our theory about general adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette gene expression profiles and their importance for cancer on clinical as well as research levels. The presence of ABCC7 ( official symbol CFTR) among the genes with key roles in the profiles supports the emerging evidence about its crucial role in various cancers....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
82,Background:To perform a molecular epidemiological analysis of viral conjunctivitis among excess conjunctivitis cases recorded at the University Hospital of Patras. Greece. for the period March to June 2012. Methods: A structured questionnaire containing demographic and clinical data was developed in order to collect retrospective data on the cases. Eye swab specimens were collected and molecular detection of adenoviruses was performed by nested PCR. Positive results were confirmed by sequencing. To determine the relatedness between the isolated sequences. a phylogenetic analysis was conducted. Results: The epidemiological analysis (including retrospective data) included 231 conjunctivitis cases (47.1% male. and 52.8% female). Based on clinical features 205 of the cases were diagnosed of viral origin (46.3% male and 53.7% female). 4 of bacterial origin (50% male and 50% female) while 22 were undefined conjunctivitis. The outbreak excess cases (included 156 cases) affected all age groups regardless gender predilection. For the positive samples indicated that 29 samples (72.5%) were AdV17. and 5 (12.5%) as AdV54. Conclusions: Molecular analysis could define the cause of viral conjunctivitis. while epidemiological data contributed to the assessment of the risk factors and underlined possible preventive measures. This study is one of the very few on viral conjunctivitis in Greece. This outbreak underscores the need for a national surveillance system for acute infectious conjunctivitis outbreaks. The epidemiological as well as molecular investigation on HAdV ocular infections is rather absent in Greece. which has no surveillance system for viral conjunctivitis....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,HIV/AIDS

The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR-delta) in endothelial activation remains poorly understood. In this study. we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of PPAR-delta and the mechanism involved. Methods and Results-In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). the synthetic PPAR-delta ligands GW0742 and GW501516 significantly inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin (assayed by real-time RT-PCR and Northern blotting). as well as the ensuing endothelial-leukocyte adhesion. Activation of PPAR-delta upregulated the expression of antioxidant genes superoxide dismutase 1. catalase. and thioredoxin and decreased reactive oxygen species production in ECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that GW0742 switched the association of BCL-6. a transcription repressor. from PPAR-delta to the vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM)-1 promoter. Small interfering RNA reduced endogenous PPAR-delta expression but potentiated the suppressive effect of GW0742 on EC activation. which suggests that the nonliganded PPAR-delta may have an opposite effect. Conclusions-We have demonstrated that ligand activation of PPAR-delta in ECs has a potent antiinflammatory effect. probably via a binary mechanism involving the induction of antioxidative genes and the release of nuclear corepressors. PPAR-delta agonists may have a potential for treating inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Heart Disease
85,Aims/hypothesis The aim of this study was to investigate changes in insulin sensitivity and expression of the gene encoding resistin (Retn) in adipocytes from long-term nitric oxide (NO)-deficient rats. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats received N-omega-nitro-Larginine methyl ester (L-NAME 0.5 mg/ml) in their drinking water for 4 weeks. while control rats received plain drinking water. During the experimental period. changes in plasma glucose. insulin and C-peptide levels were measured. After administration of L-NAME for 4 weeks. insulin sensitivity was evaluated in vivo and in vitro. An insulin binding assay was also performed to determine the number and binding affinity of insulin receptors in adipocytes. Adipocyte Retn mRNA levels were examined using northern blotting. Results Successful induction of NO deficiency was demonstrated by an increase in systemic blood pressure. No difference in plasma glucose levels was found between the two groups. Compared with the control rats. plasma insulin and C-peptide levels were significantly decreased in the NO-deficient rats. and insulin sensitivity was significantly increased. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and insulin binding capacity. but not binding affinity. were significantly increased in adipocytes isolated from NO-deficient rats. In addition. adipocyte Retn mRNA levels. but not plasma resistin levels. were significantly decreased in NO-deficient rats. and the Retn mRNA levels were negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity. Conclusions/interpretation Insulin sensitivity was increased in NO-deficient rats and this was associated with insulin binding capacity and downregulated Retn expression. These findings suggest that NO plays a regulatory role in metabolism. Dysregulation of NO production may result in the development of metabolic disorders....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Diabetes
86,Leptin is an adipocytokine that regulates body weight. and maintains energy homeostasis by promoting reduced food intake and increasing energy expenditure. Leptin expression and secretion is regulated by various factors including hormones and fatty acids. Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid that acts as source of energy in humans. We determined whether this fatty acid can play a role in leptin expression in fully differentiated human adipocytes. Mature differentiated adipocytes were incubated with or without increasing concentrations of butyrate. RNA was extracted and leptin mRNA expression was examined by Northern blot analysis. Moreover. the cells were incubated with regulators that may affect signals which may alter leptin expression and analyzed with Northern blotting. Butyrate stimulated leptin expression. and stimulated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phospho-CREB signaling in a time-dependent manner. Prior treatment of the cells with signal transduction inhibitors as pertusis toxin. G(i) protein antagonist. PD98059 (a MAPK inhibitor). and wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor) abolished leptin mRNA expression. These results suggest that butyrate can regulate leptin expression in humans at the transcriptional level. This is accomplished by: 1) G(i) protein-coupled receptors specific for short-chain fatty acids. and 2) MAPK and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (P13K) signaling pathways....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Human Metabolism
87,Expression of the GLUT4 (glucose transporter type 4 isoform) gene in adipocytes is subject to hormonal or metabolic control. In the present study. we have characterized an adipose tissue transcription factor that is influenced by fasting/refeeding regimens and insulin. Northern blotting showed that refeeding increased GLUT4 mRNA levels for 24 h in adipose tissue. Consistent with an increased GLUT4 gene expression. the mRNA levels of SREBP (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein)-1c in adipose tissue were also increased by refeeding. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. insulin treatment increased the mRNA levels of GLUT4 in adipose tissue. Serial deletion. luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility-shift assay studies indicated that the putative sterol response element is located in the region between bases - 109 and - 100 of the human GLUT4 promoter. Transduction of the SREBP-1c dominant negative form to differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes caused a reduction in the mRNA levels of GLUT4. suggesting that SREBP-1c mediates the transcription of GLUT4. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that refeeding increased the binding of SREBP-1 to the putative sterol-response element in the GLUT4. Furthermore. treating streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats with insulin restored SREBP-1 binding. In addition. we have identified an Sp1 binding site adjacent to the functional sterol-response element in the GLUT4 promoter. The Sp1 site appears to play an additive role in SREBP-1c mediated GLUT4 gene upregulation. These results suggest that upregulation of GLUT4 gene transcription might be directly mediated by SREBP-1c in adipose tissue....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Human Metabolism
88,Background: Autologous fat grafting is a prevalent technique used for softtissue augmentation; however. the poor survival rate of the grafted tissue remains a drawback of this method. Although adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are an attractive candidate for enhancing graft retention. the poor posttransplantation viability of these cells limits their application. Here we investigated whether overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) could enhance ASCs' therapeutic potential for fat transplant survival. Methods: Recombinant adenoviral vectors were used to overexpress Hsp70 in ASCs isolated from a healthy woman. The Hsp70 expression was assessed by quantitative real- time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses. The adipose tissue granules aspirated from anotherwomanweremixed with ASCs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Hsp70 (group A) or GFP alone (group B). untreated ASCs (group C). and phosphate-buffered saline (group D). Fat mixtures were then injected subcutaneously into the backs of nude mice. and graft survival was compared after 3 months. Results: Adipose-derived stem cells transduced with recombinant adenoviral vectors exhibited significantly increased Hsp70 expression in vitro. Meanwhile. weight retention analyses demonstrated that fat grafts using the group A cell population exhibited significantly higher survival rates than the other treatment groups in vivo. Moreover. histological analyses revealed that fat grafts containing GFP-Hsp70-expressing ASCs yielded significantly lower levels of tissue fibrosis and fat cysts/vacuoles. higher capillary densities. and increased numbers of viable adipocytes than the control groups. Conclusions: Our data indicate that Hsp70 overexpression enhances the efficacy of ASC therapy by improving the survival and quality of the transplanted fat tissues....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Osteoarthritis
89,Angiogenesis. a process induced by hypoxia in visceral white adipose tissues (vWAT) in the context of obesity. mediates obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance. Chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH) and sustained hypoxia (SH) induce body weight reductions and insulin resistance of different magnitudes. suggesting different hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha-related activity. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (n = 10-12/group) were exposed to either IH. SH. or room air (RA). vWAT were analyzed for insulin sensitivity (phosphorylated (pAKT)/AKT). HIF-1 alpha transcription using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing. angiogenesis using immunohistochemistry. and gene expression of different fat cell markers and HIF-1 alpha gene targets using quantitative polymerase chain reaction or microarrays. Body and vWAT weights were reduced in hypoxia (SH >IH >RA; P>>SH = RA; P < 0.001). IH induces preferential whitening of vWAT. as opposed to prominent browning in SH. Unlike SH. IH elicits early HIF-1 alpha activity that is unsustained over time and is accompanied by concurrent vascular rarefaction. inflammation. and insulin resistance. Thus. the dichotomous changes in HIF-1 alpha transcriptional activity and brown/beige/white fat balance in IH and SH should enable exploration of mechanisms by which altered sympathetic outflow. such as that which occurs in apneic patients. results in whitening. rather than the anticipated browning of adipose tissues that occurs in SH....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Diabetes
90,Adipose tissue is a rich source of multipotent mesenchymal stem-like cells. located in the perivascular niche. Based on their surface markers. these have been assigned to two main categories: CD31(-)/CD45(-)/CD34(+)/CD146(-) cells (adventitial stromal/stem cells [ASCs]) and CD31(-)/CD45(-)/CD34(-)/CD146(+) cells (pericytes [PCs]). These populations display heterogeneity of unknown significance. We hypothesized that aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. a functional marker of primitivity. could help to better define ASC and PC subclasses. To this end. the stromal vascular fraction from a human lipoaspirate was simultaneously stained with fluorescent antibodies to CD31. CD45. CD34. and CD146 antigens and the ALDH substrate Aldefluor. then sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Individual ASCs (n=67) and PCs (n=73) selected from the extremities of the ALDH-staining spectrum were transcriptionally profiled by Fluidigm single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reaction for a predefined set (n=429) of marker genes. To these single-cell data. we applied differential expression and principal component and clustering analysis. as well as an original gene coexpression network reconstruction algorithm. Despite the stochasticity at the single-cell level. covariation of gene expression analysis yielded multiple network connectivity parameters suggesting that these perivascular progenitor cell subclasses possess the following order of maturity: (a) ALDH(br)ASC (most primitive); (b) ALDH(dim)ASC; (c) ALDH(br)PC; (d) ALDH(dim)PC (least primitive). This order was independently supported by specific combinations of class-specific expressed genes and further confirmed by the analysis of associated signaling pathways. In conclusion. single-cell transcriptional analysis of four populations isolated from fat by surface markers and enzyme activity suggests a developmental hierarchy among perivascular mesenchymal stem cells supported by markers and coexpression networks.

91,Extensive research has been performed to determine the effect of freezing protocol and cryopreservation agents on the viability of adipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) as well as other cells. Unfortunately. the conclusion one may draw after decades of research utilizing fundamentally similar cryopreservation techniques is that a barrier exists. which precludes full recovery. We hypothesize that agents capable of inducing a subset of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and chaperones will reduce the intrinsic barriers to the post-thaw recovery of ASCs. ASCs were exposed to 43 degrees C for 1 h to upregulate HSPs. and the temporal HSP expression profile postheat shock was determined by performing quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting assays. The expression levels of HSP70 and HSP32 were found to be maximum at 3 h after the heat shock. whereas HSP90 and HSP27 remain unchanged. The heat shocked ASCs cryopreserved during maximal HSPs expression exhibited increased post-thaw viability than the nonheat shocked samples. Histochemical staining and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR indicated that the ASC differentiation potential was retained. Thus. suggesting that the upregulation of HSPs before a freezing insult is beneficial to ASCs and a potential alternative to the use of harmful cryoprotective agents....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Osteoarthritis
92,The long-term effect of feeding the catecholamine analog ractopamine (RAC; ractopamine hydrochloride. Elanco Animal Health. Indianapolis. IN) on the expression of genes involved in energy and lipid metabolism in subcutaneous adipose tissue was studied. Large White pigs (84 kg) were fed corn- and soybean meal-based diets supplemented with 0. 20. or 60 mg/kg of RAC for 14. 28. or 42 d. Expression (mRNA abundance) in adipose tissue of sterol regulatory binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). PPAR alpha. PPAR gamma 2. fatty acid synthase (FAS). glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). and stearoyl-CoA desaturase was determined by Northern blotting. Feed intakes did not differ. and RAC (20 and 60 mg/kg) improved BW gain at d 14. 28. and 42 (P < 0.05) and increased loin eye area (measured on d 42 only; P < 0.05). Expression of SREBP-1 and PPAR gamma 2 declined (P < 0.05) with RAC by d 28 and 42. whereas expression of PPAR alpha was increased (P < 0.05) on d 14. 28. and 42. After 14 d. expression of FAS and GLUT4 was decreased (P < 0.05) with 60 mg/kg of RAC. whereas both RAC concentrations attenuated FAS expression on d 28 and 42. Overall. adipose tissue stearoyl-CoA desaturase expression was not affected by RAC but showed somewhat less expression (P < 0.15) on d 28 at 60 mg/kg of RAC. Although prolonged. chronic RAC feeding most likely downregulates adipose tissue membrane beta-adrenergic receptors. mRNA abundances of anabolic lipid metabolism transcription factors. glucose transporters. and enzymes (SREBP-1. PPAR gamma 2. FAS. GLUT4) were still attenuated up to d 42. Conversely. a transcription factor related to oxidative metabolism expression (PPAR alpha) was enhanced. We conclude that even after 42 d. RAC still decreased expression of lipogenic genes in adipose tissue by yet undefined cyclic adenosine monophosphate-directed mechanisms. but in contemporary lean pigs. this effect is likely of limited practical significance....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
93,Conveyor systems allow quick and efficient transportation for a wide variety of materials. which make them very popular in the material handling and packaging industries. Many kinds of conveying systems are available and used according to the various needs of different industries. Adjustable speed drives are used for the operation of the conveyors used in a number of industries. We can use adjustable electric drives in a number of industrial applications. A typical adjustable speed drive consists of an induction motor and a power electronic converter. In most cases. motor speed is commanded so that the control system requires an actual speed signal for closing the speed loop. In industrial applications. speed sensors. as well as sensorless solutions. are used. Due to the possibility of current speed sensor noises and for maintenance and economic aspects. the trend is to substitute speed sensors by computational solutions. Comprehensive reviews of the sensorless drives show that there are still some persistent problems associated with the sensorless control. that needs new solutions. In ASDs. the advanced control approach of IM is the FOC method. used in modern industrial drives. The current stator controller is the integral part of various FOC systems. In the classical FOC solution. PI or hysteresis controllers are generally used. However. PCCs are reported to have better properties. System sensitivity to inaccuracy and changes of motor equivalent circuit parameters are another problem in electrical drives. Almost all of the FOC systems are very sensitive to such inaccuracies; therefore. some parameters should be estimated online. and a robust structure of the control is required. The real-time implementation of the system is an important task even for electric drives or power converters....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Control engineering

95,Despite the immense public health successes of immunization over the past century. effective vaccines are still lacking for globally important pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus. malaria. and tuberculosis. Exciting recent advances in immunology and biotechnology over the past few decades have facilitated a shift from empirical to rational vaccine design. opening possibilities for improved vaccines. Some of the most important advancements include (i) the purification of subunit antigens with high safety profiles. (ii) the identification of innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and cognate agonists responsible for inducing immune responses. and (iii) developments in nano- and microparticle fabrication and characterization techniques. Advances in particle engineering now allow highly tunable physicochemical properties of particle-based vaccines. including composition. size. shape. surface characteristics. and degradability. Enhanced collaborative efforts between researchers in immunology and materials science are expected to rise to next-generation vaccines. This process will be significantly aided by a greater understanding of the immunological principles guiding vaccine antigenicity. immunogenicity. and efficacy. With specific emphasis on PRR-targeted adjuvants and particle physicochemical properties. this review aims to provide an overview of the current literature to guide and focus rational particle-based vaccine design efforts....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,HIV/AIDS
96,Critical issues about scientific reproducibility have been raised about biomedical research. including the reliability of data and analyses within a given study. The case example in this article examined a reproducibility issue pertaining to the use of administrative data systems for evaluation of child maltreatment (CM) prevention. making use of a prevention study conducted over a decade ago that provided a unique opportunity. The place-randomization study. which randomized counties to condition. found that community-wide implementation of a parenting and family support intervention produced positive impact on county-wide rates for substantiated CM cases and out-of-home placements. documented through a state information system. The key consideration is whether and to what extent the administrative record data re-examined retroactively a decade later for the original study's time period would yield comparable results to those based on data acquired at the time of the study. The results indicated that despite small changes over time. the same data patterns and statistical effects were reproducible for the two archival outcome variables. For substantiated CM. the reproduced analyses reflected higher effect sizes and a clear pattern of reduction as a function of intervention. For out-of-home placements. effect sizes were quite comparable to the original ones. reflecting preventive impact. Overall. this case study illustrated the verifiability of data reproducibility in the context of a population outcome evaluation. which underscores the importance of reliable population-prevalence measurement as an essential part of a comprehensive public health strategy aimed at the prevention of CM.

97,Aims: Ancient DNA (aDNA) extracted from historical bones is damaged and fragmented into short segments. present in low quantity. and usually copurified with microbial DNA. A wide range of DNA quantification methods are available. The aim of this study was to compare the five most common DNA quantification methods for aDNA. Materials and Methods: Quantification methods were tested on DNA extracted from skeletal material originating from an early medieval burial site. The tested methods included ultraviolet (UV) absorbance. real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) based on SYBR (R) green detection. real-time qPCR based on a forensic kit. quantification via fluorescent dyes bonded to DNA. and fragmentary analysis. Differences between groups were tested using a paired t-test. Results: Methods that measure total DNA present in the sample (NanoDrop (TM) UV spectrophotometer and Qubit (R) fluorometer) showed the highest concentrations. Methods based on real-time qPCR underestimated the quantity of aDNA. The most accurate method of aDNA quantification was fragmentary analysis. which also allows DNA quantification of the desired length and is not affected by PCR inhibitors. Conclusions: Methods based on the quantification of the total amount of DNA in samples are unsuitable for ancient samples as they overestimate the amount of DNA presumably due to the presence of microbial DNA. Real-time qPCR methods give undervalued results due to DNA damage and the presence of PCR inhibitors. DNA quantification methods based on fragment analysis show not only the quantity of DNA but also fragment length....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Polymerase chain reaction
98,Considerable evidence suggests that adolescent exposure to delta-9-tetrahydrocanabinol (THC). the psychoactive component in marijuana. increases the risk of developing schizophrenia-related symptoms in early adulthood. In the present study. we used a combination of behavioral and molecular analyses with in vivo neuronal electrophysiology to compare the long-termeffects of adolescent versus adulthood THC exposure in rats. We report that adolescent. but not adult. THC exposure induces long-term neuropsychiatric-like phenotypes similar to those observed in clinical populations. Thus. adolescent THC exposure induced behavioral abnormalities resembling positive and negative schizophrenia-related endophenotypes and a state of neuronal hyperactivity in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway. Furthermore. we observed profound alterations in several prefrontal cortical molecular pathways consistent with sub-cortical DAergic dysregulation. Our findings demonstrate a profound dissociation in relative risk profiles for adolescent versus adulthood exposure to THC in terms of neuronal. behavioral. and molecular markers resembling neuropsychiatric pathology....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Schizophrenia
99,Several studies have confirmed that maltreatment and abuse in childhood are related to conduct problems. Less is known about such relationships with concurrent adversities in adolescence and. also. when compared with other severe adversities and possible multiple additive effects. The study encompassed a community population of 4881 adolescents 15-16 years of age 50.1 % boys and 49.9 % girls. Youth with and without conduct problem scores within the deviant range on the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was compared on 12 concurrent adversities. Based on self-reports. 4.4 % of the adolescents had conduct problem scores within the deviant range and more girls (5.1 %) than boys (3.7 %). In the deviant conduct problem group. 65.1 % had experienced two or more concurrent adversities compared with 26.3 % of youths in the non-deviant group (OR 5.23. 95 % CI 3.91-7.01). Likewise. the deviant conduct problem group was from 1.71 to 8.43 times more at the risk of experiencing the different adversities. Parental mental health problems and experiences of violence were multivariately strongest associated with conduct problem scores within the deviant range on the SDQ. A strong multiple additive relationship with adversities was found. Two-thirds of youth with SDQ conduct problem scores within the deviant range reported two or more concurrent adversities. Clinicians should seek information about kinds and amount of possible traumatic adversities in youth with conduct problems and offer evidence based treatment....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
0,Objective: To investigate the association between the perception of expressed emotion and psychopathology of school-going adolescents in a non-clinical sample. Methods: The cross-sectional field study was conducted in Kocaeli. Turkey. and comprised high-school students during the 2014-15 school years. Data was collected using the Information Collection Form. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Shortened Level of Expressed Emotion Scale. SPSS 21 was used for data analysis. Results: Of the 487 subjects. 295(60.57%) were girls and 192(39.43%) were boys. The overall median age was 16 (inter-quartile range: 15-17 years). There were significant positive relationships between the scales in terms of emotional problems (p<0.001). behavioural problems (p<0.001). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (p<0.001). and peer relationship problems (p<0.001). There was also a negative significant relationship between pro-social behaviours and expressed emotion (p<0.001). Conclusion: The concept of perceived expressed emotion in non-clinical adolescents is useful in alarming clinicians and preventing mental disorders....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Child abuse

Specifically. we test for mediating effects of perceived spirituality on religion-health relations. Using data from the 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development. we find that perceived spirituality mediates religion-health relations. but that varies based on youths' conceptualisation of spirituality. With findings confirming that perceived spirituality potentially promote youths' psychosocial health. we offer some future research directions and implications regarding relations between youths' spirituality. religion and health behaviours....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Prosocial behavior
2,Purpose The aim of this study is to find out the overall prevalence rates for the major forms of abuse among adolescents in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the differences in prevalence by age. gender and living arrangement. Methods The cross-sectional study was conducted in secondary high schools in five of the 13 main regions of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during 2012. Through a multistage stratified sampling technique. a sample (n = 16 939) of adolescents (15-19 years) were identified and invited to participate. The ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tool-Child was used for data collection. The previous year's occurrence of violence exposure. psychological. physical and sexual abuse. and neglect were assessed. Results Nearly 90% of the adolescents were between 16 and 18 years of age. and over 80% were cared for by both of their biological parents. Annual prevalence of various forms of abuse in the year before the 2012 assessment ranged between 0.10 and 0.65. with the lowest rate for sexual abuse and the highest for psychological abuse. Significantly. greater rates of all forms of abuse/exposure were found when participants lived with their mother or father only (versus with both). and even greater rates for all when they lived with their biological parent and a step-parent. Rates for violence exposure. psychological abuse and neglect were significantly greater for girls. and rate of sexual abuse was greater for boys. Conclusions More attention should be given to the effect of adolescent maltreatment particularly among girls. In addition. sexual abuse prevention programme should be targeted among boys....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
3,Background Studies of children with food allergy typically only include the mother and have not investigated the relationship between the amount of allergen needed to elicit a clinical reaction (threshold) and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Our aims were (i) to compare self-reported and parent-reported HRQL in different age groups. (ii) to evaluate the impact of severity of allergic reaction and threshold on HRQL. and (iii) to investigate factors associated with patient-reported and parent-reported HRQL. Methods Age-appropriate Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaires (FAQLQ) were completed by 73 children. 49 adolescents and 29 adults with peanut. hazelnut or egg allergy. Parents (197 mothers. 120 fathers) assessed their child's HRQL using the FAQLQ-Parent form. Clinical data and threshold values were obtained from a hospital database. Significant factors for HRQL were investigated using univariate and multivariate regression. Results Female patients reported greater impact of food allergy on HRQL than males did. Egg and hazelnut thresholds did not affect HRQL. but lower peanut threshold was associated with worse HRQL. Both parents scored their child's HRQL better than the child's own assessment. but whereas mother-reported HRQL was significantly affected by limitations in the child's social life. father-reported HRQL was affected by limitations in the family's social life. Severity of allergic reaction did not contribute significantly to HRQL. Conclusion The risk of accidental allergen ingestion and limitations in social life are associated with worse HRQL. Fathers provide a unique perspective and should have a greater opportunity to contribute to food allergy research....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
4,Pre-ejection period (PEP) reactivity to reward has been posited as a specific index of behavioral approach and incentive motivation. suggesting it might be uniquely associated with the affective and motivational deficits of anhedonia. This study evaluated PEP reactivity to a reward task as a predictor of depressive symptoms among adolescents. examining global depressive symptoms as well as specific anhedonic and nonanhedonic symptoms clusters. Participants included 76 adolescents. ages 11-15 years (52% female). This study found marginal support for an association between PEP reactivity to reward and concurrent anhedonia symptoms. but no association with nonanhedonic or the global scale. Findings are discussed in terms of potential associations between peripheral psychophysiological measures and dopaminergic functioning and also the utility of this measure for future research on anhedonia....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Depression
5,Several studies have recently demonstrated that the volumes of specific brain regions are reduced in children and adolescents with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared with those of healthy controls. Our study investigated the potential association between early traumatic experiences and altered brain regions and functions. We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature regarding functional magnetic resonance imaging and a meta-analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging studies that investigated cerebral region volumes in pediatric patients with PTSD. We searched for articles from 2000 to 2014 in the PsycINFO. PubMed. Medline. Lilacs. and ISI (Web of Knowledge) databases. All data regarding the amygdala. hippocampus. corpus callosum. brain. and intracranial volumes that fit the inclusion criteria were extracted and combined in a meta-analysis that assessed differences between groups. The meta-analysis found reduced total corpus callosum areas and reduced total cerebral and intracranial volumes in the patients with PTSD. The total hippocampus (left and right hippocampus) and gray matter volumes of the amygdala and frontal lobe were also reduced. but these differences were not significant. The functional studies revealed differences in brain region activation in response to stimuli in the post-traumatic stress symptoms/PTSD group. Our results confirmed that the pediatric patients with PTSD exhibited structural and functional brain abnormalities and that some of the abnormalities occurred in different brain regions than those observed in adults....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health
6,Childhood maltreatment is strongly associated with depression. which is characterized by reduced reactivity to reward. Identifying factors that mitigate risk for depression in maltreated children is important for understanding etiological links between maltreatment and depression as well as improving early intervention and prevention. We examine whether high reward reactivity at behavioral and neurobiological levels is a marker of resilience to depressive symptomology in adolescence following childhood maltreatment. A sample of 59 adolescents (21 with a history of maltreatment; Mean Age = 16.95 years. SD = 1.44) completed an fMRI task involving passive viewing of emotional stimuli. BOLD signal changes to positive relative to neutral images were extracted in basal ganglia regions of interest. Participants also completed a behavioral reward-processing task outside the scanner. Depression symptoms were assessed at the time of the MRI and again 2 years later. Greater reward reactivity across behavioral and neurobiological measures moderated the association of maltreatment with baseline depression. Specifically. faster reaction time (RT) to cues paired with monetary reward relative to those unpaired with reward and greater BOLD signal in the left pallidum was associated with lower depression symptoms in maltreated youth. Longitudinally. greater BOLD signal in the left putamen moderated change in depression scores over time. such that higher levels of reward response were associated with lower increases in depression over time among maltreated youths. Reactivity to monetary reward and positive social images. at both behavioral and neurobiological levels. is a potential marker of resilience to depression among adolescents exposed to maltreatment. These findings add to a growing body of work highlighting individual differences in reactivity to reward as a core neurodevelopmental mechanism in the etiology of depression....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Depression
7,While exposure to adverse family experiences (AFEs). subset of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). has been associated with childhood obesity. less is known about the impact of exposures to each type of AFE. Using 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health data. we evaluated associations between exposure to individual AFEs and overweight/obesity status in children 10 years or older. adjusting for socio-demographic factors. Caregivers reported their child's height. weight. and exposure to nine AFEs; body mass index (BMI) was classified by Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) guidelines. At Mayo Clinic. we calculated frequencies and weighted estimates of socio-demographic factors and AFEs. Unadjusted and adjusted weighted multinomial logistic regression models were employed to assess the independent associations of each AFE and the different AFE composite scores with BMI category. Exposure to two or more AFEs was independently associated with increased odds of overweight (odds ratio [OR]. 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]. 1.13. 1.56) and obese (OR. 1.45; 95% CI. 1.21. 1.73) status after adjustment for age. household income. parents' education-level. race and sex. Death of parent (OR. 1.59; 95% CI. 1.18. 2.15) and hardship due to family income (OR. 1.26; 95% CI. 1.06. 1.50) were independently associated with obesity status with adjustment for other AFEs and socio-demographic factors. Our results suggest that. in addition to cumulative exposure to AFEs. exposure to certain childhood experiences are more strongly associated with childhood obesity than others. Death of parent and hardship due to family income are individual AFEs. which are strongly predictive of obesity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

8,BackgroundIncreasing evidence supports that mentalization deficits may have a role in the genesis of young age depression; however. few studies examined this issue in clinical populations. MethodsOutpatients aged 14-21. suffering from various psychiatric disorders. were assessed using the Mentalization Questionnaire (MZQ). the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). using data from age-matched healthy students for comparison. The relationship between CTQ. MZQ. and BDI scores was examined at the cross-sectional level. including mediation analyses. and longitudinally. in a subsample who underwent a psychotherapy intervention. ResultsOf 83 subjects. 33 (39.8%) had mentalization levels that were 1 standard deviation below those of comparison subjects. In the whole sample. the levels of mentalization were inversely associated with BDI (r=-.68. p<.001) and CTQ scores (r=-.30. p=.006). Moreover. MZQ scores mediated a large part of the effect of childhood trauma on depression (total effect: 10.6. 95% CI: 5.3. 15.9; direct effect: 6.5. 95% CI: 2.1. 10.8; indirect effect: 4.1. 95% CI: 1.5. 7.4). This effect was almost entirely explained by the Affect Regulation subscale. In patients re-evaluated after four sessions (n=37). the decrease in BDI scores correlated with the increase in MZQ scores (r=.40. p=.02). ConclusionsIn a juvenile clinical sample. deficits of mentalization abilities were associated with the severity of depression and explained part of the depressogenic effects of childhood trauma....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Depression
9,Social network sites (SNSs) are relatively new phenomena. and the relationship between SNSs and psychopathology remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the type of SNSs depressed adolescents use and the incidence of depressive disclosure on SNSs among them. The study was designed to be cross-sectional. The sample consisted of 53 adolescents diagnosed with depressive disorder. as confirmed by K-SADS-PL. and 55 non-depressed adolescents. The Children's Depression Inventory. Social Anxiety Scale and Social Network Use Questionnaire were administered. The primary finding was that the amount of time spent on the Internet and on SNSs was significantly higher among depressed adolescents than non-depressed adolescents. Additionally. depressed adolescents reported significantly higher disclosure of anhedonia. worthlessness. guilt. loss of concentration. irritability and thoughts of suicide on SNSs. The intensity of the depression sharing was significantly higher in the depressed group. Depressed young people use social networks to express their symptoms. Adolescents' disclosure on social networks may be able to guide relatives. friends and mental health professionals....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Depression
10,Introduction: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety are frequently comorbid disorders associated with different types of abnormal performance on neuropsychological tests. Although some studies have shown that comorbid anxiety alters ADHD test performance. results inconsistently show both improvements and worsening of different abilities. with failures to replicate across different anxiety disorders. Alternatively. trait anxiety may reflect a more stable influence on ADHD test performance than various diagnosable anxiety disorders. Method: To better understand the possible enhancing or deleterious effects of anxiety on ADHD cognitive impairments. this study examined the effect of individual differences in trait anxiety measured by the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) on a battery of computerized. rapid-performance tests measuring attention and impulsivity-related performance in 98 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) Combined-Subtype ADHD adolescents and 123 healthy controls. It was hypothesized that trait anxiety would attenuate response inhibition and attention deficits in ADHD. Results: ADHD-diagnosed adolescents with higher trait anxiety performed better on indices of sustained attention. reaction time. and motor variability. and had altered overall test-performance strategy. while response inhibition was affected in both ADHD and non-ADHD. Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that pathological levels of anxiety are not needed to see differences in ADHD neuropsychological test performance. Instead. mildly elevated trait anxiety confers a protective influence by reducing the degree of impairment seen in ADHD. These findings suggest that better performing ADHD adolescents might have optimized levels of cortical arousal. and raise new questions about how best to identify the neurobiological substrates responsible for the beneficial effects....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Attention
11,BackgroundNeglect is often overlooked in adolescence. due in part to assumptions about autonomy and misinterpretation of behaviors being part of normal adolescent development. Emotional maltreatment (abuse or neglect) has a damaging effect throughout the lifespan. but is rarely recognized amongst adolescents. Our review aims to identify features that adolescents experiencing neglect and/ or emotional maltreatment report. MethodA rapid review methodology searched 8 databases (1990-2014). supplemented by hand searching journals. and references. identifying 2.568 abstracts. Two independent reviews were undertaken of 279 articles. by trained reviewers. using standardised critical appraisal. Eligible studies: primary studies of children aged 13-17 years. with substantiated neglect and/ or emotional maltreatment. containing self-reported features. Results19 publications from 13 studies were included. demonstrating associations between both neglect and emotional maltreatment with internalising features (9 studies) including depression. post traumatic symptomatology and anxiety; emotional maltreatment was associated with suicidal ideation. while neglect was not (1 study); neglect was associated with alcohol related problems (3 studies). substance misuse (2 studies). delinquency for boys (1 study). teenage pregnancy (1 study). and general victimization for girls (1 study). while emotionally maltreated girls reported more externalising symptoms (1 study). Dating violence victimization was associated with neglect and emotional maltreatment (2 studies). while emotional abuse of boys. but not neglect. was associated with dating violence perpetration (1 study). and neither neglect nor emotional maltreatment had an association with low self-esteem (2 studies). Neither neglect nor emotional maltreatment had an effect on school performance (1 study). but neglected boys showed greater school engagement than neglected girls (1 study). ConclusionsIf asked. neglected or emotionally maltreated adolescents describe significant difficulties with their mental health. social relationships. and alcohol or substance misuse. Practitioners working with youths who exhibit these features should recognize the detrimental impact of maltreatment at this developmental stage. and identify whether maltreatment is a contributory factor that should be addressed....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Child abuse
12,Background: Rumination predicts depression in adults and adolescents. The development of rumination has been linked to parenting practices. but only limited research has investigated this and research has tended to rely on self-report parenting measures. Aims: To investigate the relationship between female adolescent rumination and maternal modelling. criticism and positivity using an observational measure of parental behaviour. Method: A cross-sectional design was used. Daughters aged 16-18 years and their mothers (n = 154 dyads) completed questionnaire measures of rumination and affect. Mothers of girls with rumination scores in the upper and lower quartile (both n = 26) also completed the Five Minute Speech Sample. which was used to measure maternal criticism and positivity. Results: Mothers of low rumination girls made significantly more positive comments about their daughters than the mothers of high ruminators. Mothers made very few critical comments. Self-reported rumination was not correlated in mothers and daughters. suggesting a lack of support for the potential role of modelling. Conclusion: Overall. low maternal positivity was associated with rumination in female adolescents. There was no evidence that maternal rumination or criticism were associated with adolescent rumination. The results suggest a number of implications for future research. including the need for prospective longitudinal studies using observational parenting measures....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Depression
13,An Internet-based relapse prevention supplement to adolescent substance abuse treatment programming is a promising modality to reinforce treatment gains and enhance recovery; however. an evidence base is lacking. To assess the efficacy of the online Navigating my Journey (NmJ) program. 129 adolescent-aged participants (ages 13-23) receiving substance abuse treatment participated in a randomized parallel group study comparing two conditions: experimental (NmJ) versus attention control (viewed wellness articles from the Nemours Foundation at their discretion). Participants in the experimental condition were asked to complete 12 core lessons over 3 months. Lesson content was developed to teach evidence-based relapse prevention skills. Data were collected at four time points: baseline. 1-month follow up. 3-month follow up. and 6-month follow up. We used a linear mixed modeling approach to test for differences between conditions on each outcome. Participants in the experimental condition reported a significantly greater increase in motivation to reduce or not misuse drugs from baseline to 3-month follow up and from baseline to 6-month follow up. compared to the control participants. Participants in the experimental condition also reported a greater decrease in drug use score from baseline to 3-month follow up. compared to the control participants. An analysis of age as a potential moderator suggested that the intervention may be more effective for older adolescents. Greater use of the program was associated with greater self-efficacy and lower self-reported substance use over time. Relapse prevention treatment with adolescents may be facilitated by theory-based online interventions. NCT02125539....,Psychology,Medical,Attention,Addiction
14,Carotenoids are plant secondary metabolites that comprise two main groups: carotenes and xanthophylls. The latter group includes zeaxanthin which is synthesized by beta-carotene hydroxylase catalyzing the hydroxylation of the beta-rings of beta-carotene molecules. To develop tools to alter carotenoid biosynthesis in plants. we isolated a cDNA clone encoding a candidate beta-carotene hydroxylase. CrtH1. from the flower petals of Adonis aestivalis. CrtH1 protein has homology to beta-carotene hydroxylases from other organisms. and possesses the four histidine motifs conserved in this family of enzymes. Sequence analysis predicted the presence of a putative plastid transit peptide at the amino terminus and four transmembrane helical regions. Southern-blot analysis showed CrtH1 to be encoded by a multicopy gene family with at least three members in A. aestivalis. Analysis of CrtH1 transcript abundance by Northern blotting indicates it is highly expressed in flower petals. roots and stems. with relatively low expression in leaves and developing seeds. CrtH1 was able to catalyze the formation of zeaxanthin and its intermediate precursor beta-cryptoxanthin from beta-carotene in functional assays conducted in E. coli. Expression of CrtH1 in Arabidopsis thaliana wild type and a mutant deficient for endogenous beta-carotene hydroxylases enhanced the biosynthesis of violaxanthin in the seeds....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Enzymology
15,The cDNA AmphiARF . encoding a novel member of ARF family was for the first time identified from the gut cDNA library of amphioxus Branchiostoma becheri tsingtauense . The deduced amino acid sequence includes the motifs involved in GTP binding (DVGG. NKQD and SAK) and hydrolysis (GXDXXGK). and a glycine at position 2 for N-terminal myristoylation. which are all characteristic of ARFs. However. it has a 46 amino acid C-terminal extension (positions 183-227). which was not found in any ARF family previously described including ARF-like proteins. This suggests that AmphiARF is a new member of ARF family. which was also supported by the phylogenetic analysis. It is highly likely that the extended C-terminal of AmphiARF is a novel addition occurring after cephalochordate/vertebrate split. Northern blotting analysis revealed that AmphiARF transcript was present in all tissues examined. consistent with the involvement of ARFs in the fundamental role like vesicular trafficking of proteins....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
16,In whole cell patch-clamp recordings. we characterized the L-type Ca2+ currents in bovine adrenal zona fasciculata (AZF) cells and explored their role. along with the role of T-type channels. in ACTH- and angiotensin II (ANG II)-stimulated cortisol secretion. Two distinct dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type currents were identified. both of which were activated at relatively hyperpolarized potentials. One activated with rapid kinetics and. in conjunction with Northern blotting and PCR. was determined to be Ca(v)1.3. The other. expressed in approximately one-half of AZF cells. activated with extremely slow voltage-dependent kinetics and combined properties not previously reported for an L-type Ca2+ channel. The T-type Ca2+ channel antagonist 3.5-dichloro-N-[1-(2.2-dimethyl-tetrahydro-pyran-4-ylmethyl)-4-fluoro-piperidin-4-ylmethyl]-benzamide (TTA-P2) inhibited Ca(v)3.2 current in these cells. as well as ACTH- and ANG II-stimulated cortisol secretion. at concentrations that did not affect L-type currents. In contrast. nifedipine specifically inhibited L-type currents and cortisol secretion. but less effectively than TTA-P2. Diphenylbutylpiperidine Ca2+ antagonists. including pimozide. penfluridol. and fluspirilene. and the dihydropyridine niguldipine blocked Ca(v)3.2 and L-type currents and inhibited ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion with similar potency. This study shows that bovine AZF cells express three Ca2+ channels. the voltage-dependent gating and kinetics of which could orchestrate complex mechanisms linking peptide hormone receptors to cortisol secretion through action potentials or sustained depolarization. The function of the novel. slowly activating L-type channel is of particular interest in this respect. Regardless. the well-correlated selective inhibition of T- and L-type currents and ACTH- and ANG II-stimulated cortisol secretion by TTA-P2 and nifedipine establish the critical importance of these channels in AZF cell physiology....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Hereditary Angioedema
17,Background Although it has been well established that atrial natriuretic peptide gene-disrupted (ANPS(-/-)) mice are a useful model of salt-sensitive hypertension. surprisingly little is known about the control of their intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and pressure-natriuresis mechanism. key components in blood pressure. fluid and electrolyte regulation. The aim of this study was to determine whether ANP disruption results in changes in the renal and adrenal local RAS and the acute pressure natriuresis mechanism. Methods Renal and adrenal renin. angiotensin type 1 (AT(1))((A and B)) and angiotensin type 2 (AT(2)) receptor messenger RNA expression levels were determined by northern blotting or real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Plasma aldosterone and renal and adrenal angiotensin II peptide levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. To examine the acute pressure natriuresis response. changes in renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure (RIHP) were assessed after manipulations of renal arterial pressure (RAP) in anaesthetized mice. Results Renal and adrenal renin mRNA and angiotensin II levels were lower in ANPS(-/-) and (+/-) mice compared with (+/+) mice. ANP(-/-) mice also had greater renal AT(1A) and adrenal AT2 mRNA levels compared with the other genotypes. RAP and RIHP were significantly higher in (-/-) mice compared with (+/+) mice. Furthermore. there was a blunted slope of the RAP-RIHP relationship after increases in RAP in ANP(-/-) mice. Conclusion These data indicate that ANP disruption results in a blunting of the dynamic properties of the acute pressure-natriuresis mechanism at increased levels of RAP. as well as a reduced expression of renal and adrenal local RAS....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Kidney Health
18,Background: Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening emergency of which reliable epidemiological data are lacking. This study aimed to analyze how quickly patients presenting with anaphylaxis were treated in emergency and whether treatment followed the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) guidelines. Methods: Patient data were collected between April 2009 and April 2013. Emergency doctors completed a questionnaire for adult patients presenting at the emergency department (ED) of the St. Pierre hospital in Brussels with anaphylaxis. Inclusion criteria were based on the Sampson criteria of anaphylaxis. Data were analyzed using a Microsoft Excel database. Results: About 0.04% (100/230878) of all emergency visits in adults presented with anaphylaxis. 64% of patients received their first medical help later than 30 min after symptom onset. 67% of patients received adrenaline. 85% oral antihistamines. and 89% received IV glucocorticosteroids. 46/100 patients were discharged directly from the ED. of which 87% received further medical prescriptions for self-administration: 67% corticosteroids. 83% antihistamines. and 9% intramuscular adrenaline. 74% were instructed to consult an allergologist for adequate diagnosis. 54/100 patients were hospitalized. Conclusion: The majority of patients were treated according to the EAACI guidelines for management of anaphylaxis. but only a minority received the recommended adrenaline auto-injector for self-administration at discharge. Because the majority of patients received medical help later than 30 min after symptom onset. adrenaline auto-injector prescription is a necessity. The low rate of doctors prescribing adrenaline auto-injectors in the ED setting underlines the need to train doctors of various backgrounds in prevention and treatment of anaphylaxis and the close collaboration with allergologists....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
19,BACKGROUND: Allergy immunotherapy can result in systemic allergic reactions and even life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring epinephrine administration. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe epinephrine use in the clinical trial development programs of 3 rapidly dissolving sublingual immunotherapy tablets (SLITtablets; Merck & Co.. Inc.. Kenilworth. NJ/ALK. Horsholm. Denmark/Torii Pharmaceutical Co.. Ltd.. Tokyo. Japan). METHODS: Data on epinephrine use were collected from 13 timothy grass SLIT-tablet trials (MK-7243; <= 2800 bioequivalent allergen units/75.000 SQ-T dose. n =2497; placebo. n = 2139). 5 short ragweed SLIT-tablet trials (MK-3641; <= 12 Amb a 1-U. n =1725; placebo. n =770). and 11 house dust mite (HDM) SLIT-tablet trials (MK-8237; <= 12 SQ-HDM; n=3930; placebo. n =2246). RESULTS: In grass SLIT-tablet trials. epinephrine was used 13 times (grass SLIT-tablet. n =10; placebo. n =3). Eight administrations were for grass SLIT-tablet-related adverse events (AEs): 4 for systemic allergic reactions and 4 for local mouth and/or throat swelling. In ragweed SLIT-tablet trials. epinephrine was used 9 times in 8 subjects (ragweed SLIT-tablet. n =7; placebo. n =1 =2 administrations for protracted anaphylaxis]). Four administrations were for ragweed SLIT-tablet-related AEs: 1 for systemic allergic reaction and 3 for local mouth and/or pharynx/throat swelling. In HDM SLIT-tablet trials. epinephrine was administered 13 times (HDM SLIT-tablet. n =8; placebo. n =5). Four administrations were for HDM SLITtablet- related AEs: 1 for systemic allergic reaction and 3 for local events. Of the 16 epinephrine administrations for events related to SLIT-tablet treatment. 11 occurred within the first week of treatment (7 administrations on day 1) and 5 were subject self-administered. CONCLUSIONS: Epinephrine administrations in response to SLIT-tablet-related reactions in clinical trials are uncommon. typically occur within the first week of treatment. and are rarely self-administered. All SLIT-tablet-related events treated with epinephrine were nonserious. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy. Asthma & Immunology...,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
20,3 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II deficiency (3 beta HSD2) congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a rare cause of ambiguous genitalia. resulting in abnormal virilisation in both 46XY and 46XX. We describe a case of 46XY ambiguous genitalia that was misdiagnosed as androgen insensitivity syndrome. The correct diagnosis was made after adrenarche. Genotyping demonstrated compound heterozygosity in two alleles. the previously described c.244G >A (p.Ala82Thr). and a novel 931C >.T(p. Gln311*) variant. We suggest that adrenarche unmasked the condition by driving cortisol production to rates that caused the mutant 3bHSD2 enzyme to become rate limiting for cortisol production. This case illustrates how markedly different the effects of this condition may be on androgen production compared with glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production. It also demonstrates how current guidelines based on urinary steroids and cortisol sufficiency may not arrive at the correct diagnosis. and underlines the importance of gene testing in the work-up of disorders of sexual differentiation....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Low Testosterone
21,Background: Attachment anxiety and avoidance have been found to be associated with worry. A substantial body of research suggests that intolerance of uncertainty (IOU) is a phenomenon which predicts level of worry. yet the relationship between attachment. IOU and worry remains to be investigated. Methods: The present study recruited 281 participants from the community within Australia to complete an online survey incorporating the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale. the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale-Revised. and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire. Results: The analyses revealed attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were positively correlated with IOU. and that attachment anxiety. attachment avoidance and IOU were positively correlated with worry. Furthermore. IOU was found to mediate the relationship between attachment anxiety and worry. even when attachment avoidance was entered as a covariate. By contrast. for the relationship between attachment avoidance and worry. intolerance of uncertainty only mediated the association if attachment anxiety was ignored. Conclusions: The results of the study suggest that IOU may play a key role in the relationship between adult attachment difficulties and the experience of worry. These findings may have significant implications for the conceptualisation and psychological treatment of attachment related difficulties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

22,Context: Psychosocial factors can impact lung transplant outcomes. However. it is currently unknown whether abuse survivorship influences lung transplant survival. Objective: To characterize the abuse history of adult lung transplant patients and determine whether such history is associated with mortality. Patients and Other Participants: Adult lung transplant recipients evaluated from 2000 to 2004. Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome was post-lung transplantation survival. The secondary outcomes included demographic. transplantation. or psychological assessment differences between those with a history of abuse survivorship and those without. Results: Thirty-three lung transplant recipients (35.5% male. median age: 55 years) were included. A history of abuse survivorship was common (24.2%) and was associated with decreased survival following lung transplantation (P = .003). There was no difference in sex. marital status. or smoking history between abuse survivors and those who denied being the victim of abuse. Abuse survivors had a higher Personality Assessment Screener total score. a measure of maladaptive personality traits (P = .02). Conclusion: Abuse survivorship is common in lung transplant patients and associated with increased posttransplant mortality and increased maladaptive personality traits. This preliminary evidence suggests that lung transplant patients should be screened for abuse history and provided with appropriate treatment of survivorship issues to potentially improve their health outcomes from transplantation....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Parkinson's Disease
23,Background: Symptom clusters have not previously been explored among individuals with atrial fibrillation of any type. Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine the number of symptom clusters present among adults with chronic atrial fibrillation and to explore sociodemographic and clinical factors potentially associated with cluster membership. Methods: This was a cross-sectional secondary data analysis of 335 Australian community-dwelling adults with chronic (recurrent paroxysmal. persistent. or permanent) atrial fibrillation. We used self-reported symptoms and agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis to determine the number and content of symptom clusters present. Results: There were slightly more male (52%) than female participants. with a mean (SD) age of 72 (11.25) years. Three symptom clusters were evident. including a vagal cluster (nausea and diaphoresis). a tired cluster (fatigue/lethargy. weakness. syncope/dizziness. and dyspnea/breathlessness). and a heart cluster (chest pain/discomfort and palpitations/fluttering). We compared patient characteristics among those with all the symptoms in the cluster. those with some of the symptoms in the cluster. and those with none of the symptoms in the cluster. The only statistically significant differences were in age. gender. and the use of antiarrhythmic medications for the heart cluster. Women were more likely to have the heart symptom cluster than men were. Individuals with all of the symptoms in the heart cluster were younger (69.6 vs 73.7 years; P = .029) than those with none of the symptoms in the heart cluster and were more likely to be on antiarrhythmic medications. Conclusion: Three unique atrial fibrillation symptom clusters were identified in this study population....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Atrial Fibrillation
24,This review discusses the unmet needs of patients with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who are transitioning into adulthood. Although awareness and recognition of ADHD in children. adolescents. and adults have improved in recent years. there is often an interruption in management of the disorder when adolescent patients transition to adult health care services. This review has the following objectives: (1) to identify key issues patients with ADHD (with or without an early diagnosis) face during transition into adulthood; (2) to review the current clinical practice and country-specific approaches to the management of the transition into adulthood for patients with ADHD; (3) to discuss challenges facing clinicians and their patients when drug treatment for ADHD is initiated; (4) to review current ADHD guidelines on transition management in Hong Kong. Singapore. South Korea. Turkey. and Africa; and (5) to examine economic consequences associated with ADHD. The review suggests that the transition period to adult ADHD may be an underresearched and underserved area. The transition period plays an important role regarding how ADHD symptoms may be perceived and acted upon by adult psychiatrists. Further studies are needed to explore the characteristics of the transition period. If only a fraction of adolescents go on to have mental disorders during adulthood. especially ADHD. it is crucial to identify their characteristics to target appropriate interventions at the beginning of the course of illness. There continues to be low recognition of adult ADHD and a severe lack of medical services equipped to diagnose and care for patients with ADHD transitioning from child to adult services....,Psychology,Medical,Attention,Autism
25,Recent studies have examined non-suicidal self-injury in community and clinical samples. but there is no published research on non-suicidal self-injury in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. This lack of research is surprising. since individuals with autism spectrum disorder have high rates of risk factors for non-suicidal self-injury. including depression and poor emotion regulation skills. Using an online survey. we examined non-suicidal self-injury methods. frequency. severity. functions. and initial motivations in adults with autism spectrum disorder (n=42). We also compared their non-suicidal self-injury characteristics to those of a gender-matched group of adults without autism spectrum disorder (n=42). Of the participants with autism spectrum disorder. 50% reported a history of non-suicidal self-injury. This proportion is higher than non-suicidal self-injury rates previously reported for college students. adult community samples. and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. which suggests that adults with autism spectrum disorder have increased risk for engaging in non-suicidal self-injury. Women with autism spectrum disorder were significantly more likely to endorse non-suicidal self-injury. relative to men with autism spectrum disorder. A history of non-suicidal self-injury was not related to current depression or emotion dysregulation for the participants with autism spectrum disorder. Non-suicidal self-injury characteristics among the adults with autism spectrum disorder were similar to non-suicidal self-injury in adults without autism spectrum disorder. These preliminary findings highlight the need for increased awareness and further research about non-suicidal self-injury within autism spectrum disorder....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Borderline personality disorder
26,Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have established themselves as one of the preferred digital implementation platforms in a plethora of current industrial applications. and extensions and improvements are still continuously being included in the devices. This paper reviews recent advancements in FPGA technology. emphasizing the novel features that may significantly contribute to the development of more efficient digital systems for industrial applications. Special attention is paid to the design paradigm shift caused by the availability of increasingly powerful embedded (and soft) processors. which transformed FPGAs from hardware accelerators to very powerful system-on-chip (SoC) platforms. New analog resources. floating-point operators. and hard memory controllers are also described. because of the great advantages they provide to designers. Software tools are being strongly influenced by the design paradigm shift. which requires fromthem a much better support for software developers. Focusing mainly on this issue. recent advancements in software resources [intellectual property (IP) cores and design tools] are also reviewed. The impact of new FPGA features in industrial applications is analyzed in detail in three main areas. namely digital real-time simulation. advanced control techniques. and electronic instrumentation. with focus on mechatronics. robotics. and power systems design. The way digital systems are being currently designed in these areas is comprehensively reviewed. and a critical analysis of how they could significantly benefit from new FPGA features is presented....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
27,Research documents how exposure to adversity in childhood leads to negative health outcomes across the lifespan. Less is known about protective factors - aspects of the individual. family. and community that promote good health despite exposure to adversity. Guided by the Resilience Portfolio Model. this study examined protective factors associated with physical health in a sample of adolescents and adults exposed to high levels of adversity including child abuse. A rural community sample of 2565 individuals with average age of 30 participated in surveys via computer assisted software. Participants completed self-report measures of physical health. adversity. and a range of protective factors drawn from research on resilience. Participants reporting a greater burden of childhood victimization and current financial strain (but not other adverse life events) had poorer physical health. but those with strengths in emotion regulation. meaning making. community support. social support. and practicing forgiveness reported better health. As hypothesized. strengths across resilience portfolio domains (regulatory. meaning making. and interpersonal) had independent. positive associations with health related quality of life after accounting for participants' exposure to adversity. Prevention and intervention efforts for child maltreatment should focus on bolstering a portfolio of strengths. The foundation of the work needs to begin with families early in the lifespan.

28,Background: Given growing numbers of older adults with mental and substance use disorders (MSUDs). this study examined the association between ten types of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and lifetime MSUDs among those aged 50+. Methods: Data (N=14.738 for the 50+ age group) came from the 2012 to 2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Using multivariable binary logistic regression analyses. we examined relationships between ten ACEs and six lifetime MSUDs (major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety. post-traumatic stress. alcohol use. drug use. and nicotine use disorders). Gender differences were examined using tests of interaction effects and gender-separate logistic regression models. Results: Of the sample. 53.2% of women and 50.0% of men reported at least one ACE. For both genders. parental/other adult's substance abuse was the most prevalent (22.6%). followed by physical abuse. and emotional neglect. Child abuse and neglect and parental/other adult's mental illness and substance abuse had small but consistently significant associations with MSUDs (e.g.. odds ratio = 1.28. 95% CI= 1.12-1.46 for parental/other adult's substance misuse and MDD). Although the relationship between total number of ACEs andMSUDs was cumulative for both men and women. the associations of physical abuse. sexual abuse. emotional neglect. and parental separation/divorce with MSUDs were stronger among men. Conclusions: This study underscores the significant yet modest association between ACEs and lifetime MSUDs in late life. More research is needed to investigate why ACEs seem to have greater effects on older men and to discern the sources of gender differences in ACEs' effects....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
29,Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been associated with an increased risk of a variety of diseases. including cancer. However. research has largely ignored how ACEs impact cancer screening. a potential intermediate outcome. As such. the present study examined the association between ACEs and ever and recent use of Papanicolaou (Pap) test. among women aged 21 and older. Materials and Methods: Analyses used the 2009 Tennessee Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (n = 1527) to model odds of ever and recently (within the last 3 years) engaging in Pap tests screening from nine different adversities. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were run to accomplish this. Results: In bivariate and multivariate models. living in a household in which adults treated each other violently increased odds of ever receiving a Pap test. In bivariate models. physical and sexual abuse was associated with decreased odds of receiving a recent Pap test. After accounting for confounders. only the latter association remained significant. Conclusions: Results highlight a potential mechanism by which early childhood experiences can impact the development of cervical cancer. Providers of care should consider modifications to their screening practices. including screening for child abuse. to better serve all women....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Cancer
30,Substantial research shows that early adversity. including child abuse and neglect. is associated with diminished health across the life course and across generations. Less well understood is the relationship between early adversity and adult socioeconomic status. including education. employment. and income. Collectively. these outcomes provide an indication of overall life opportunity. We analyzed data from 10 states and the District of Columbia that used the adverse childhood experiences (ACE) module in the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to examine the association between ACEs and adult education. employment. and income. Compared to participants with no ACEs. those with higher ACE scores were more likely to report high school non-completion. unemployment. and living in a household below the federal poverty level. This evidence suggests that preventing early adversity may impact health and life opportunities that reverberate across generations. Current efforts to prevent early adversity might be more successful if they broaden public and professional understanding (i.e.. the narrative) of the links between early adversity and poverty. We discuss our findings within the context of structural policies and processes that may further contribute to the intergenerational continuity of child abuse and neglect and poverty.

31,Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been linked to increased use of tobacco products later in life. However. studies to date have ignored smokeless tobacco products. To address this. data from the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. which interviewed adults 18 years and over (N = 102.716) were analyzed. Logistic regression models were fit to estimate odds ratios of ever smoking. current smoking and current smokeless tobacco use in relation to ACEs. Results showed that less than 4 % of respondents currently used smokeless tobacco products. while 44.95 and 18.57 % reported ever and current smoking. respectively. Physical abuse (OR 1.40; 95 % CI 1.14. 1.72). emotional abuse (OR 1.41; 95 % CI 1.19. 1.67). sexual abuse (OR 0.70; 95 % CI 0.51. 0.95). living with a drug user (OR 1.50; 95 % CI 1.17. 1.93). living with someone who was jailed (OR 1.50; 95 % CI 1.11. 2.02) and having parents who were separated or divorced (OR 1.31; 95 % CI 1.09. 1.57) were associated with smokeless tobacco use in unadjusted models. After accounting for confounders. physical abuse (OR 1.43; 95 % CI 1.16. 1.78). emotional abuse (OR 1.32; 95 % CI 1.10. 1.57). living with a problem drinker (OR 1.30; 95 % CI 1.08. 1.58). living with a drug user (OR 1.31; 95 % CI 1.00. 1.72) and living with adults who treated each other violently (OR 1.30; 95 % CI 1.05. 1.62) were associated with smokeless tobacco use. Living with someone who was mentally ill (OR 0.70; 95 % CI 0.53. 0.92) was associated with smokeless tobacco use after accounting for confounders and all ACEs. Results indicated that some childhood adversities are associated with use of smokeless tobacco products. Special attention is needed to prevent tobacco use of different types among those experiencing ACEs....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Addiction
32,Objective: To ascertain efficacy and tolerability of carbamazepine (CBZ). sodium valproate (VPA). lamotrigine (LTG) and levetiracetam (LEV) using the UKAED register (www.ukaed.info). Methods: Patients on CBZ (n=91). VPA (n=61). LTG (n=105). LEV (n=72) and healthy control subjects (CTR) on no medication (n=51) were extracted. All patients had anonymously provided information on seizure type and frequency and completed the Liverpool Adverse Event Profile (LAEP). Results: The number of seizure-free patients in the last 4 weeks was overall CBZ/VPA /LTG/LEV=60%/79%/67%/67%. for generalized epilepsy was CBZ/VPA/LTG/LEV=67%/89%/65%/94%. and for localization-related epilepsy was CBZ/VPA/LTG/LEV=59%/71%/67%/57%. Mean LAEP scores were CBZ/VPA/LTG/LEV/CTR=42.21/39.66/39.86/43.01/29.69. The mean LAEP was significantly higher in patients reporting depression and in patients with active epilepsy than in patients without depression and remission. Central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects including memory problems. difficulty concentrating. depression. unsteadiness. restlessness. feelings of anger. shaky hands and dizziness were significantly more frequent in CBZ. VPA. LTG and LEV than in CTR. The feeling of anger was significantly more frequent in LEV. and depression was significantly more frequent in CBZ compared to the other drugs. Conclusion: In this Internet-based register of self-reported efficacy and tolerability. CBZ. VPA. LTG and LEV were similar. Self-reported CNS adverse effects were significantly more frequent than in controls. In addition. anger was associated with LEV and depression with CBZ. Confounding factors were depression and uncontrolled epilepsy....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Depression
33,Background: Aeluropus lagopoides is a salt and drought tolerant grass from Poaceae family. distributed widely in arid regions. There is almost no information about the genetics or genome of this close relative of wheat that stands harsh conditions of deserts. Objectives: The main aim of this research was to isolation and characterization of salt and drought inducible genes from A. lagopoides by Differential Display Amplified fragment length polymorphism (DD-AFLP) method. Material and Methods: In this research A. lagopoides was grown under salt or drought conditions and after modifying the DD-AFLP method several fragments were isolated and after nomination their induction was studied by reverse northern blotting. Results: DD-AFLP led to the improvement of a non-radioactive method for which many parameters were optimized. Having screened approximately 1600 transcript-derived fragments. 1.4 percent of them showed varied expression levels in response to high salt or drought treatments. The relative abundance of twenty one selected differentially expressed fragments was inspected by reverse northern blotting that affirmed the potential of this applied method. Sequence comparisons revealed that some of the isolated genes are involved in osmotic adjustment. regulation of transcription. cation transportation and stress responses. These data clearly show that the modified DD-AFLP method was a successful and reliable approach for the isolation of differentially expressed genes....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
34,We had previously reported that Vibrio hollisae produces aerobactin in response to iron starvation. In the present study. we identified in V hollisae ATCC33564 the aerobactin system cluster which consists of eight genes. hatCDB. iucABCD and iutA. The hatCDB genes encode proteins homologous to components of bacterial ATP binding cassette transport systems for ferric aerobactin. The iucABCD and iutA orthologs code for aerobactin biosynthesis enzymes and the ferric aerobactin receptor. respectively. In accordance with their iron-regulated expression. putative Fur box sequences were found within the respective promoter regions of hatC. iucA and iutA. The monocistronic iutA transcript was detected by northern blotting. Moreover. phenotypic comparison between the wild-type strain and its targeted gene disruptants supported the biological functions that were expected for the respective operons and genes on the basis of the homology search. The arrangement of the aerobactin gene clusters thus far found in Vibrio and enterobacterial species was compared and discussed from an evolutionary point of view. (c) 2006 Elsevier SAS.

35,Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology will enable next generation radars achieve better jamming resistance capability and low probability of intercept by spreading their emissions over a wide frequency range. These radars systems consist of a large number of transmit/receive modules (TRMs) which are electronically scanned in a tight time-synchronized manner. This requires digital control to move closer to the radio front end on the antennas. Other emerging technologies. such as cognitive radars and MIMO radars. will continue to drive the need for complex timing. synchronization. and high mix RF and digital measurement requirements. To meet these challenges. radar engineers will need a platform based approach which delivers capabilities such as multi-channel phase aligned measurements over wide bandwidths and high-throughput streaming. This paper discusses the fundamentals of AESA radars and trends in radar systems. It analyzes the impact of these trends on test system architecture and explains how the advances in PXI modular instrumentation can meet these challenging requirements....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
36,Obesity continues to be a major global problem. Various cancers are related to obesity and proper understanding of their aetiology. especially their molecular tumour biology is important for early diagnosis and better treatment. Genes play an important role in the development of obesity. Few genes such as leptin. leptin receptor encoded by the db (diabetes). pro-opiomelanocortin. AgRP and NPY and melanocortin-4 receptors and insulin-induced gene 2 were linked to obesity. MicroRNAs control gene expression via mRNA degradation and protein translation inhibition and influence cell differentiation. cell growth and cell death. Overexpression of miR-143 inhibits tumour growth by suppressing B cell lymphoma 2. extracellular signal-regulated kinase-5 activities and KRAS oncogene. Cancers of the breast. uterus. renal. thyroid and liver are also related to obesity. Any disturbance in the production of sex hormones and insulin. leads to distortion in the balance between cell proliferation. differentiation and apoptosis. The possible mechanism linking obesity to cancer involves alteration in the level of adipokines and sex hormones. These mediators act as biomarkers for cancer progression and act as targets for cancer therapy and prevention. Interestingly. many anti-cancerous drugs are also beneficial in treating obesity and vice versa. We also reviewed the possible link in the mechanism of few drugs which act both on cancer and obesity. The present review may be important for molecular biologists. oncologists and clinicians treating cancers and also pave the way for better therapeutic options....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
37,ObjectiveThe aim of our study was to investigate. in bipolar patients. whether affect lability was associated with suicidal ideation incidence during 2-year follow-up. and which subtype of affect lability was associated with suicidal ideation. MethodA total of 319 euthymic or mildly depressed bipolar outpatients recruited in the French FondaMental Advanced Centres of Expertise for Bipolar Disorder were divided into two subgroups according to the occurrence of suicidal ideation during a 2-year follow-up. Affect lability was assessed by the French version of the Affect Lability Scale. ResultsBipolar patients with high affect lability were more likely to report suicidal ideation during follow-up. even after adjustment for age. study level. rapid cycling. current depression level. anxiety disorder. and lifetime history SA (OR = 2.47; 95% CI [1.15-5.30]. P = 0.01). The risk of suicidal ideation increased with the level of affect lability. More specifically. the propensity to switch from neutral to elation affect. from anxious to depressive affect (or inversely). and from neutral to anger affect predicted suicidal ideation. ConclusionReducing affective lability could become a new therapeutic target of suicidal prevention in bipolar disorder....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Alzheimer's Disease
38,Objective: To examine the association between gestational age (GA) at birth across the normal GA spectrum (37-41 weeks) and the temperament and health of 3-month old infants.Methods: The sample comprised 242 low-risk mothers and infants without chronic illnesses or severe pregnancy complications. Infant temperament was defined by three constructs: Negative Affectivity (NA). Extraversion. and Regulation. assessed by parents' reports on the Infant Behavior Questionnaire. Infants' health was defined as the number of nonroutine doctors' visits attended by the infants since their release from the hospital after birth. Analyses employed a continuous measure of GA to assess outcomes across GAs and a categorical measure (37. 38. 39-41 weeks GA) to examine contrasts.Results: Extraversion was positively related to GA primarily due to the lower scores of infants born at 37 weeks compared to infants born at 39-41 weeks GA. NA showed a similar effect. The odds of infants born at 37 weeks attending a nonroutine medical visit were 2.8 times that of infants born full-term.Discussion: Infants born at 37 weeks GA express less affect and use more nonroutine medical services than do infants born at 39-41 weeks GA. The findings underscore the importance of considering the risks of pregnancy prolongation with the developmental risk associated with early-term delivery....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Children's Health
39,Background: The ability to recognize emotional expression is essential for social interactions. adapting to the environment. and quality of life. Emotion recognition is impaired in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). thus rehabilitation of these skills has the potential to elicit significant benefits. Objective: This study sought to establish whether emotion recognition capacity could be rehabilitated in people with AD. Methods: Thirty-six participants with AD were assigned to one of three conditions: an experimental group (EG) that received 20 sessions of rehabilitation of emotion recognition and 20 sessions of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST). a control group (CG) that received 40 sessions of CST. and a treatment as usual group (TAU). Results: A positive treatment effect favoring the EG was found; participants were better able to correctly identify emotions (p = 0.021). made fewer errors of commission (p = 0.002). had greater precision of processing (p = 0.021). and faster processing speed (p = 0.001). Specifically. the EG were better able to identify sadness (p = 0.016). disgust (p = 0.005). and the neutral expression (p = 0.014). with quicker processing speed for disgust (p = 0.002). These gains were maintained at one month follow-up with the exception of processing speed for surprise. which improved. Conclusion: Capacity to recognize facial expressions of emotions can be improved through specific rehabilitation in people with AD. and gains are still present at a one month follow up. These findings have implications for the design of rehabilitation techniques for people with AD that may lead to improved quality of life and social interactions for this population....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Alzheimer's Disease
40,In response to Palermo (2016. Australian Psychologist. in press) comments. some aspects of the target paper are further elaborated here. In particular. given Palermo's timely emphasis on the potential social and cultural implications of research demonstrating the beneficial consequences of negative affect. the historical background. and practical implications of the experimental evidence are elaborated. Furthermore. the reviewer also comments on the applicability of alternative theoretical conceptualizations to the data reported here. and this issue also receives further attention. Overall. it is concluded that there is now strong and convergent evidence for the often beneficial consequences of mild negative affect. and these findings deserve serious consideration in practical applications of psychology. and in our conceptions of what represents a healthy and balanced emotional life. Embracing and accepting periods of negative affectivity should be recognised as a normal and healthy part of the human condition. and the cultural bias towards positive affect should be tempered by an appreciation of the adaptive benefits of dysphoria....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Depression
41,The subtle relationship between feeling and thinking. affect and cognition has fascinated philosophers and writers since time immemorial. yet. empirical research on this topic was relatively neglected by psychologists until recently. There have been many claims emphasising the beneficial cognitive and behavioural consequences of positive affect. Many recent works suggest that negative affect may also facilitate optimal performance in many situations. consistent with evolutionary theories suggesting the adaptive signalling function of various affective states. This paper reviews traditional and current psychological theories linking affect to social thinking and behaviour. A variety of empirical studies from our laboratory will also be presented. demonstrating that in many situations. negative affect promotes optimal performance in cognitive and social tasks. including tasks such as memory. social judgements. motivation. and strategic interpersonal behaviours. These results will be interpreted in terms of a dual-process theory that predicts that negative affect promotes a more accommodative. vigilant. and externally focused thinking strategy. The relevance of these findings for recent affect-cognition theories will be discussed. and the practical implications of negative affect promoting improved social thinking and performance in a number of applied fields will be considered....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
42,Background: One in twenty-five people suffer from a mood disorder. Current treatments are sub-optimal with poor patient response and uncertain modes-of-action. There is thus a need to better understand underlying mechanisms that determine mood. and how these go wrong in affective disorders. Systems biology approaches have yielded important biological discoveries for other complex diseases such as cancer. and their potential in affective disorders will be reviewed. Scope of review: This review will provide a general background to affective disorders. plus an outline of experimental and computational systems biology. The current application of these approaches in understanding affective disorders will be considered. and future recommendations made. Major conclusions: Experimental systems biology has been applied to the study of affective disorders. especially at the genome and transcriptomic levels. However. data generation has been slowed by a lack of human tissue or suitable animal models. At present. computational systems biology has only be applied to understanding affective disorders on a few occasions. These studies provide sufficient novel biological insight to motivate further use of computational biology in this field. General significance: In common with many complex diseases much time and money has been spent on the generation of large-scale experimental datasets. The next step is to use the emerging computational approaches. predominantly developed in the field of oncology. to leverage the most biological insight from these datasets. This will lead to the critical breakthroughs required for more effective diagnosis. stratification and treatment of affective disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

43,Individuals can apply different processing strategies to deal with situations they encounter. One central question in social-cognition research refers to the factors that determine reliance on different processing strategies. Parting from a functional perspective. which holds that processing strategies need to be adjusted to the requirements of the situation. we argue that individuals' mood carries information about the benign versus problematic nature of the situation and thus that mood can regulate cognitive processing. Focusing on mental abstraction. we propose that positive mood contributes to a processing style characterized by reliance on prior knowledge in the form of general knowledge structures. whereas negative mood elicits a processing style characterized by attention to details and consideration of new situation-specific information....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
44,Most broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs) elicited in response to HIV-1 infection are extraordinarily mutated. One goal of HIV-1 vaccine development is to induce antibodies that are similar to the most potent and broad BNAbs isolated from infected subjects. The most effective BNAbs have very high mutation frequencies. indicative of the long periods of continual activation necessary to acquire the BNAb phenotype through affinity maturation. Understanding the mutational patterns that define the maturation pathways in BNAb development is critical to vaccine design efforts to recapitulate through vaccination the successful routes to neutralization breadth and potency that have occurred in natural infection. Studying the mutational changes that occur during affinity maturation. however. requires accurate partitioning of sequence data into B-cell clones and identification of the starting point of a B-cell clonal lineage. the initial V(D)J rearrangement. Here. we describe the statistical framework we have used to perform these tasks. Through the recent advancement of these and similar computational methods. many HIV-1 ancestral antibodies have been inferred. synthesized and their structures determined. This has allowed. for the first time. the investigation of the structural mechanisms underlying the affinity maturation process in HIV-1 antibody development. Here. we review what has been learned from this atomic-level structural characterization of affinity maturation in HIV-1 antibodies and the implications for vaccine design....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,HIV/AIDS
45,Alterations in mitochondrial respiration contribute to the development and progression of cancer via abnormal biogenesis. including generation of reactive oxygen species. Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase hinge protein (UQCRH) consists of the cytochrome bc1 complex serving respiration in mitochondria. In the present study. we analyzed UQCRH abnormalities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its association with clinical outcomes of patients. UQCRH expression in HCC was determined via semiquantitative and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of 96 surgically resected HCC tissues positive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen. UQCRH was frequently overexpressed in HCC tissues (46.8%. based on 2.1-fold cutoff). UQCRH overexpression was observed in HCCs with larger tumor size. poorer differentiation. or vascular invasion. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significantly shorter overall (P=0.005) and recurrence-free survival (P=0.027) in patients with tumors overexpressing UQCRH. The prognostic impact of UQCRH was significant in subgroups of patients divided according to the -fetoprotein (AFP) level. The patient subgroup with higher AFP levels (20ng/mL) exhibited significant differences in 5-year overall (18.5% vs. 67.9%) and recurrence-free survival rates (11.1% vs. 46.4%) between groups with and without UQCRH overexpression. In contrast. no marked survival differences were observed between subgroups with lower AFP levels (<20ng/mL). Multivariate analysis defined UQCRH as an independent poor prognostic factor. Conclusively. our results indicate that UQCRH overexpression is correlated with poor outcomes of HCC patients. Furthermore. in patients grouped as high risk based on elevated AFP. lack of UQCRH overexpression could be a useful indicator for clinical treatment....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
46,Recent forecasts suggest that African countries must triple their current electricity generation by 2030. Our multicriteria assessment of wind and solar potential for large regions of Africa shows how economically competitive and low-environmental-impact renewable resources can significantly contribute to meeting this demand. We created the Multicriteria Analysis for Planning Renewable Energy (MapRE) framework to map and characterize solar and wind energy zones in 21 countries in the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) and the Eastern Africa Power Pool (EAPP) and find that potential is several times greater than demand in many countries. Significant fractions of demand can be quickly served with "no-regrets" options-or zones that are low-cost. low-environmental impact. and highly accessible. Because no-regrets options are spatially heterogeneous. international interconnections are necessary to help achieve low-carbon development for the region as a whole. and interconnections that support the best renewable options may differ from those planned for hydropower expansion. Additionally. interconnections and selecting wind sites to match demand reduce the need for SAPP-wide conventional generation capacity by 9.5% in a high-wind scenario. resulting in a 6-20% cost savings. depending on the avoided conventional technology. Strategic selection of low-impact and accessible zones is more cost effective with interconnections compared with solutions without interconnections. Overall results are robust to multiple load growth scenarios. Together. results show that multicriteria site selection and deliberate planning of interconnections may significantly increase the economic and environmental competitiveness of renewable alternatives relative to conventional generation....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electrical generator
47,X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) has been associated with a broad range of infections. but enteroviral disease represents one of the most damaging infections. The risk of enteroviral infection in XLA is lower now than in the setting of intramuscular immunoglobulin or in patients without immunoglobulin replacement. but the rate of infection has not declined significantly in the era of intravenous immunoglobulin replacement. Enteroviruses can cause inflammation of nearly every organ. but in XLA. infections often manifest as dermatomyositis or chronic meningoencephalitis. Difficulty and delay in recognizing symptoms and lack of specific therapy contribute to the poor outcomes. Furthermore. cerebrospinal fluid detection of enteroviruses is not very sensitive. Reluctance to perform brain biopsies can lead to significant delays. The other feature compromising outcomes is the lack of specific therapy. High-dose peripheral and intraventricular immunoglobulin have been used. but failure is still common. New antienteroviral drugs are in development and show promise for immunodeficient patients with life-threatening infections with enterovirus. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy.

48,This paper presents a 1V -70dB THD audio Automatic Gain Control (AGC) circuits. The proposed AGC is based on feedback topologies and the gain is digital controlled. A pi-type resistors network is used in the Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) as the passive feedback device to realize gain linearity in decibels and increase the gain accuracy. The hysteresis comparator eliminate the chattering effects when the output signal of Peak Detector changes rapidly around the threshold. The design is implemented in 0.18 mu m CMOS and occupies an active area of 0.41mm2. The power consumption of AGC is about 0.17mW at 1V supply voltage. The gain of PGA in the AGC loop ranges from 0dB to 40dB in 2dB step with gain error not more than 0.2dB. The integrated noise in the audio range (20 Hz similar to 20 kHz) is 2.28 mu VRMS when the gain is set at 40dB. The total harmonic distortion (THD) is below -70dB over the audio frequencies at 0.4-Vpp differential output....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Analog signal processing
49,Background: Age might affect the change in care needs in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after treatment during their transition process from hospital to home. However. there have been no studies that focus on this. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine changes in unmet supportive care needs in young (G65 years old) and elderly (Q65 years old) groups of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma from before discharge to 2 months after discharge. Methods: A longitudinal prospective study design was used with recruited participants at a teaching hospital in Taiwan. Data were collected 3 times: within 3 days before discharge and at 1 and 2 months after discharge. A set of questionnaires was used to assess participants' levels of supportive care needs. symptom distress. anxiety. and depression. Results: A total of 104 patients completed the data collection process. Supportive care needs decreased monthly after discharge. with health system and information being the domain with the highest level of unmet needs in the 2 groups. The young group had a higher level of overall unmet needs before discharge. but they had a lower level of overall needs compared with the elderly group after 2 months of discharge. Conclusions: Age could be a significant potential factor to affect change in unmet needs during transition. Implications for Practice: Comprehensive assessment in care needs especially in the health system and information and physical and daily living domains before discharge is recommended to design personalized education programs before discharge....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Cancer
50,The proportion of workers in their 50s. 60s. and 70s is larger than ever before. Current work-force trends indicate global increases in retirement ages and that many individuals are working until later ages than in decades past. and older people are applying for jobs and at later ages. Research to date on age discrimination in selection has focused primarily on disparate treatment or intentional discrimination. However. based on accumulated knowledge about age-related changes in cognitive and physical abilities as well as changes in personality and work motivation across the life course. we suggest that more attention be paid to the possibility of age-based subgroup differences on selection procedures. manifested as adverse impact and differential prediction. We provide recommendations to guide future human resource management research and practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved....,Psychology,Psychology,Attention,Prejudice
51,Objective: Patients over 60 years of age have higher mortality and morbidity after major liver resections. Nitric oxide (NO) derived from the catalytic activity of Nos2 plays a beneficial role in liver regeneration (LR) after partial hepatectomy (PH). In this experiment. we evaluated the effect of Nos2 knockout (KO) on LR in aged mice after PH. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study. 52 two-year-old Nos2 KO and 46 the same age wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 2/3 PH. Liver tissues were collected at 11 time points after PH. Mice survival ratio and liver coefficient (liver-weight/ body-weight) was calculated. Transcript and protein levels were estimated by reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. respectively. Results: The aged Nos2 KO mice had lower survival ratio (P=0.039) and liver coefficient (P=0.002) at the termination phase. Nos2 transcript level was obviously increased after PH in WT mice and undetected in the Nos2 KO mice. During LR. the expression at the transcript level of Cyclin D1. Cyclin A2 and Cyclin B1 and protein expression level of proliferation marker Ki67 and proliferation-associated transcription factors JNK1. NF-kB and STAT3 were decreased or delayed. The expression of pro-apoptotic proteins. CAS-PASE3. CASPASE9 and BAX. was increased in the Nos2 KO mice. Conclusion: Decreased survival ratio and impaired LR in aged Nos2 KO mice is probably due to decreased liver cell proliferation and increased liver cell apoptosis....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Kidney Health
52,The health benefits of playing football and the importance of exercise and social contact for healthy ageing are well established. but few older adults in the UK take enough exercise. Football is popular. flexible in format and draws players into engrossing. effortful and social exercise. but the physical demands of play at full speed may make it unsustainable for some older adults. Restricted to walking pace. will play still be engaging? Will health benefits be retained? Will physical demands remain manageable? This pilot study aims to investigate: (1) the experience of older adults playing walking football every week. is it sustainable and rewarding. (2) the intensity and locomotor pattern of walking football. (3) the scale and nature of walking football health benefits and (4) possible cognitive benefits of playing walking football through measures of processing speed. selective and divided attention and updating and inhibition components of executive function. 'Walking football' and 'waiting list' groups were compared before and after 12 weeks of one-hour per week football. Walking football was found to be engaging. sustainable for older adults and moderately intensive; however. selective health and cognitive benefits were not found from this brief intervention....,Psychology,Medical,Attention,Senior Health
53,The question of specific properties of life compared to nonliving things accompanied biology throughout its history. At times this question generated major controversies with largely diverging opinions. Basically. mechanistic thinkers. who tried to understand organismic functions in terms of nonliving machines. were opposed by those who tried to describe specific properties or even special forces being active within living entities. As this question included the human body. these controversies always have been of special relevance to our self-image and also touched practical issues of medicine. During the second half of the twentieth century. it seemed to be resolved that organisms are explainable basically as physicochemical machines. Especially from the perspective of molecular biology. it seemed to be clear that organisms need to be explained solely by the chemical functions of their component parts. although some resistance to this view never ceased. This research program has been working quite successfully. so that science today knows a lot about the physiological and chemical processes within organisms. However. again new doubts arise questioning whether the mere continuation of this analytical approach will finally generate a fundamental understanding of living entities. At the beginning of the twenty-first century the quest for a new synthesis actually comes from analytical empiricists themselves. The hypothesis of the present paper is that empirical research has been developed far enough today. that it reveals by itself the materials and the prerequisites to understand more of the specific properties of life. Without recourse to mysterious forces. it is possible to generate answers to this age-old question. just using recent. empirically generated knowledge. This view does not contradict the results of reductionistic research. but rather grants them meaning within the context of organismic systems and also may increase their practical usefulness. Although several of these properties have been discussed before. different authors usually concentrated on a single one or some of them. The paper describes ten specific properties of living entities as they can be deduced from contemporary science. The aim is to demonstrate that the results of empirical research show both the necessity as well as the possibility of the development of a new conception of life to build a coherent understanding of organismic functions....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Molecular biology
54,Important energy reductions can be achieved in the building sector by providing occupants with feedback about their energy-consumption levels. Recent studies link the success of energy-feedback methods to the level of occupant engagement with people in their social circles and the resulting peer pressure to conform to certain social norms. Despite promising results. the literature remains limited in scope to individual rather than groups of buildings. This has limited the design of feedback initiatives leveraging social connections that exist. or that can be induced. within and between buildings. The current paper addresses the identified gap by proposing a multilayer agent-based model that serves as a test bed to simulate and optimize feedback methods applied on any building stock (e.g..community and city). Monte Carlo and sensitivity analyses show that connecting occupants of different buildings. while increasing their engagement with the feedback mechanism. can lead to energy reductions exceeding 10%. The findings confirm the role of social networks in energy-conservation diffusion. setting the stage for large-scale and socially engaging energy-conservation initiatives.

55,Extensively employed in reproductive science. the term fetal-maternal interface describes how maternal and fetal tissues interact in the womb to produce the transient placenta. purporting a theory of pregnancy where mother'. fetus'. and placenta' are already-separate entities. However. considerable scientific evidence supports a different theory. which is also elaborated in feminist and new materialist literatures. Informed by interviews with placenta scientists as well as secondary sources on placental immunology and the developmental origins of health and disease. I explore evidence not of interfacing during pregnancy. but of intra-action. or the mutual emergence of entities in simultaneous practices of differentiation and connection. I argue that attending to evidence that can be figured as intra-action enables us to recognize. account for. and attend to diffuse responsibilities for fetal-maternal outcomes that extend beyond mothers to the biosocial milieus of pregnancy. In reimaging the intra-action of placentas. a new understanding of what constitutes a healthy pregnancy' becomes possible....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Parenting
56,Background: The collection of subgingival plaque samples with paper points is time-consuming and accident-sensitive. However. the collection of saliva is simple and contains pathogens of all intraoral surfaces. The aim of this study is to investigate whether a sampling strategy with mouthrinse (mouthrinse sample [MSP]; test) leads to results comparable with standard sampling method (multiple site test from the deepest pocket of each quadrant [MT4]; control). Methods: In 50 patients with periodontitis. subgingival plaque was sampled from the deepest pocket of each quadrant by using paper points and by gaining saliva with saline mouthrinse. Analysis was performed using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test for 11 periodontal pathogens. Results: Detection frequency of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (MT4/MSP: 42%/36%). Porphyromonas gingivalis (78%/66%). Tannerella forsythia (98%/84%). Treponema denticola (94%/74%). Parvimonas micra (86%/62%). Campylobacter rectus (90%/76%). Eubacterium nodatum (64%/30%). Prevotella intermedia (58%/54%). and Eikenella corrodens (90%/82%) was higher with MT4 than MSP. For Fusobacterium nucleatum (100%/100%). there was no difference between test and control. Only detection frequency of Capnocytophaga species (68%/74%) was higher with MSP than MT4. Differences were significant for P. gingivalis. T. forsythia. T. denticola. P. micra. C. rectus. and E. nodatum. Conclusions: There is no significant difference between MT4 and MSP for detection frequency of key pathogen A. actinomycetemcomitans. Key pathogens P. gingivalis. T. forsythia. T. denticola. P. micra. C. rectus. and E. nodatum show statistically higher detection frequencies with MT4....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Ankylosing Spondylitis
57,This paper proposes a probabilistic optimization method that produces optimal bidding curves to be submitted by an aggregator to the day-ahead electricity market and the intraday market. considering the flexible demand of his customers (based in time dependent resources such as batteries and shiftable demand) and taking into account the possible imbalance costs as well as the uncertainty of forecasts (market prices. demand. and renewable energy sources (RES) generation). The optimization strategy aims to minimize the total cost of the traded energy over a whole day. taking into account the intertemporal constraints. The proposed formulation leads to the solution of different linear optimization problems. following the natural temporal sequence of electricity spot markets. Intertemporal constraints regarding time dependent resources are fulfilled through a scheduling process performed after the day-ahead market clearing. Each of the different problems is of moderate dimension and requires short computation times. The benefits of the proposed strategy are assessed comparing the payments done by an aggregator over a sample period of one year following different deterministic and probabilistic strategies. Results show that probabilistic strategy reports better benefits for aggregators participating in power markets....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electricity
58,This paper examines the association between the Great Recession and four measures of the risk for maternal child abuse and neglect: (1) maternal physical aggression; (2) maternal psychological aggression; (3) physical neglect by mothers; and (4) supervisory/exposure neglect by mothers. It draws on rich longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. a longitudinal birth cohort study of families in 20 U.S. cities (N = 3177; 50% African American. 25% Hispanic; 22% non-Hispanic white; 3% other). The study collected information for the 9 year follow-up survey before. during. and after the Great Recession (2007-2010). Interview dates were linked to two macroeconomic measures of the Great Recession: the national Consumer Sentiment Index and the local unemployment rate. Also included are a wide range of socio-demographic controls. as well as city fixed effects and controls for prior parenting. Results indicate that the Great Recession was associated with increased risk of child abuse but decreased risk of child neglect. Households with social fathers present may have been particularly adversely affected. Results also indicate that economic uncertainty during the Great Recession. as measured by the Consumer Sentiment Index and the unemployment rate. had direct effects on the risk of abuse or neglect. which were not mediated by individual-level measures of economic hardship or poor mental health.

59,A growing body of research suggests that bipolar spectrum disorders (BSDs) are associated with high aggression. However. little research has prospectively examined how aggression may affect time to onset of hypomanic/manic versus major depressive episodes. In a longitudinal study. we tested the hypothesis that aggression would prospectively predict a shorter time to the onset of hypomanic/manic episodes and a longer time to the onset of major depressive episodes. based on the behavioral approach system theory of BSDs. Young adults (N=120) diagnosed with cyclothymia. bipolar II disorder. or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified were followed every 4 months for an average of 3.55 years. Participants completed measures of depressive and manic symptoms. family history of mood disorder. impulsivity. and aggression at baseline and were followed prospectively with semistructured diagnostic interview assessments of hypomanic/manic and major depressive episodes and treatment seeking for mood problems. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses indicated that overall. physical. and verbal aggression predicted a longer time to major depressive episode onset. even after controlling for baseline depressive and manic symptoms. family history of mood disorder. treatment seeking for mood problems. and impulsivity. Aggression. however. did not significantly predict time to onset of hypomanic/manic episodes. controlling for the same covariates. The findings suggest that approach-related behaviors may be utilized to delay the onset of major depressive episodes among people with BSDs....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Borderline personality disorder
60,Fipronil is an important member of the phenylpyrazole group of insecticides and is widely used for various crops and vegetables to control insects. thereby exposing birds. animals. and humans to fipronil. Currently. there is limited information on the effects of fipronil exposure in Japanese quail. Therefore. our aim was to assess the reproductive toxicological effects of fipronil in the Japanese quail in a 15-day gavage study and then its recovery over a period of 60 days. Fipronil-administration led to significant losses in both feed intake and body weight. Whereas. the gonadosomatic index was not affected. and histological changes observed in the testes were reversible. particularly by day 45 and day 60 of recovery. Cloacal gland atrophy. reduced foam quantity and a reduction in fertility. sexual and aggressive behaviors. and serum testosterone with elevated estradiol (E2) hormone levels were also observed. All these changes gradually reversed during various recovery periods. Further. alterations in hepatic vitellogenin (Vtg) and estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) gene expression. assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. were also observed. Specifically. ER alpha 1 was induced after fipronil administration. while the Vtg transcript was elevated during both exposure and recovery periods. Our results showed that fipronil exposure has a profound negative influence on reproductive traits in the male Japanese quail and exhibits an estrogenic activity that can raise the incidence of infertility in males. Nevertheless. most of the changes could be reversed after a recovery period of 30-45 days. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

61,Although previous studies in inmates. forensic and psychiatric samples suggest the relation between childhood trauma and suicide behavior as well as between childhood trauma and violent delinquency. the understanding of possible underlying mechanisms is still fragmentary. In a naturalistic study design. we tested if suicidal attempts and violent crimes are differently associated with adverse childhood experiences and levels of appetitive aggression in male forensic psychiatry inpatients. Adverse childhood experiences and appetitive aggression styles were collected by means of self-report measures. suicide attempts were taken from the medical history and violent crimes were appraised by official court records. The data were analyzed by the means of generalized linear models. Results revealed that appetitive aggression and adverse childhood experiences were significant predictors of suicide attempts. whereas violent crimes were associated solely with appetitive aggression. Suicide attempts and violent delinquency in forensic patients seem to be both positively associated with high levels of appetitive aggression. whereas their etiological pathways might differ with regard to adverse childhood experiences. Considering these interrelations to a greater extent might improve both diagnostics and treatment of forensic patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

62,Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (Smpd3). which encodes neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2). is a key molecule for skeletal development as well as for the cytodifferentiation of odontoblasts and alveolar bone. However. the effects of nSMase2 on the cytodifferentiation of periodontal ligament (PDL) cells are still unclear. In this study. the authors analyzed the effects of Smpd3 on the cytodifferentiation of human PDL (HPDL) cells. The authors found that Smpd3 increases the mRNA expression of calcification-related genes. such as alkaline phosphatase (ALPase). type I collagen. osteopontin. Osterix (Osx). and runt-related transcription factor (Runx)-2 in HPDL cells. In contrast. GW4869. an inhibitor of nSMase2. clearly decreased the mRNA expression of ALPase. type I collagen. and osteocalcin in HPDL cells. suggesting that Smpd3 enhances HPDL cytodifferentiation. Next. the authors used exome sequencing to evaluate the genetic variants of Smpd3 in a Japanese population with aggressive periodontitis (AgP). Among 44 unrelated subjects. the authors identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). rs145616324. in Smpd3 as a putative genetic variant for AgP among Japanese people. Moreover. Smpd3 harboring this SNP did not increase the sphingomyelinase activity or mRNA expression of ALPase. type I collagen. osteopontin. Osx. or Runx2. suggesting that this SNP inhibits Smpd3 such that it has no effect on the cytodifferentiation of HPDL cells. These data suggest that Smpd3 plays a crucial role in maintaining the homeostasis of PDL tissue....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Ankylosing Spondylitis
63,Background: Dendritic cells (DCs) form a key link between innate and adaptive immune responses. The aim of this study is to analyze presence and distribution of immature (im) and mature (m) DCs in gingival tissue samples obtained from patients diagnosed with aggressive periodontitis (AgP). chronic periodontitis (CP). and clinically healthy periodontium (control group). Methods: Gingival tissue samples obtained from patients with: 1) AgP (aged= 35 years); and 3) control group (aged >18 years) (n = 10 per group) were collected. Two-way analysis of variance and posterior Fisher least significant difference test were used to observe differences between the means of cells positively marked for imDC (S100. CD1a. and CD207) and mDC (CD208) immunomarkers. Results: imDCs were more numerous in AgP than CP and control groups. being statistically significant only for S100+ cells. Conversely. mDCs were visualized in higher numbers in CP than AgP and control groups (both P <0.05). Considering frequency of immunostained cells. the number of S100+ cells was greater than CD207+ and CD1a+ cells. followed by a lesser number of CD208+ cells. in all groups. Conclusions: Considering that the ability of DCs to regulate immunity is dependent on DC maturation. results suggest that predominance of imDCs appears to be involved in AgP pathogenesis. probably due to lack of ability to induce immune cell activation. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the role of DC maturation in regulating immune responses in periodontal disease....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Psoriatic Arthritis
64,Fragile x syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited mental retardation disease. This is caused due to expansion of CGG triplet in 5'-untranslated region of fragile x mental retardation 1 (FMR-1) gene. In most of the cases. abnormally large size of the CGG repeat (>200) undergoes hypermethylation. which in turn silences the FMR-1 gene causing thereby complete lack of its protein product called fragile x mental retardation protein (FMRP). Lack of FMRP due to gene silencing or production of faulty protein due to point mutation in KH2 domain of FMRP alters the translational process in neurons and leads to expression of mental retardation phenotype on the patients. The FMRP is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues; however. it is predominantly expressed in neurons and testis. It possesses heterogeneity and is found in many isoforms due to alternative splicing of the FMR-1 transcript. Based on our data from the Western-. slot-. Northern blotting and immunohistochemical studies. we report here the down regulation of Fmr-1 gene and FMRP in mice brain in age-dependent manner. The present finding is important in respect to FMRP-dependent various brain functions i.e.. learning. memory. cognition etc. that decrease with advancing age....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Autism
65,Background: Early life stress (ELS) and addiction are related to age-related diseases and telomere shortening. However. the role of telomere length (TL) in crack cocaine addiction remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the TL in a sample of crack cocaine dependent-women who reported an ELS history and in a community-based sample of elderly women as a reference group for senescence. Methods: This study included treatment seeking crack cocaine dependents women (n = 127) and elderly women without a psychiatric diagnosis (ELD. n = 49). The crack cocaine sample was divided in two groups according to their Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) scores: presence of history of childhood abuse and neglect (CRACK-ELS) and absence of ELS history (CRACK). TL was assessed by T/S ratio obtained from peripheral blood DNA using quantitative PCR assay. esults: CRACK and CRACK-ELS subjects exhibited shortened TL in comparison to the ELD group. despite their younger age. Among crack cocaine sample. CRACK-ELS group had significantly shorter telomeres than the CRACK group. Correlation analysis within crack cocaine group indicated that TL was negatively correlated with emotional abuse scores. Conclusions: These results support previous findings associating telomere shortening with both ELS and drug addiction. This study suggests new evidence of a distinct biological phenotype for drug-dependent women with ELS. The results support the biological senescence hypothesis underpinning ELS experience.

66,Significance: With the growing population of baby boomers. there is a great need to determine the effects of advanced age on the function of the immune system. Recent Advances: It is universally accepted that advanced age is associated with a chronic low-grade inflammatory state that is referred to as inflamm-aging. which alters the function of both immune and nonimmune cells. Mononuclear phagocytes play a central role in both the initiation and resolution of inflammation in multiple organ systems and exhibit marked changes in phenotype and function in response to environmental cues. including the low levels of pro-inflammatory mediators seen in the aged. Critical Issues: Although we know a great deal about the function of immune cells in young adults and there is a growing body of literature focusing on aging of the adaptive immune system. much less is known about the impact of age on innate immunity and the critical role of the mononuclear phagocytes in this process. Future Directions: In this article. there is a focus on the tissue-specific monocyte and macrophage subsets and how they are altered in the aged milieu. with the hope that this compilation of observations will spark an expansion of research in the field....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Senior Health
67,Rationale: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a biological marker of aging. and shorter LTL is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Reduced regenerative capacity has been proposed as a mechanism. Bone marrow-derived circulating progenitor cells are involved in tissue repair and regeneration. Objective: Main objective of this study was to examine the relationship between LTL and progenitor cells and their impact on adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Methods and Results: We measured LTL by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 566 outpatients (age: 63 +/- 9 years; 76% men) with coronary artery disease. Circulating progenitor cells were enumerated by flow cytometry. After adjustment for age. sex. race. body mass index. smoking status. and previous myocardial infarction. a shorter LTL was associated with a lower CD34+ cell count: for each 10% shorter LTL. CD34+ levels were 5.2% lower (P< 0.001). After adjustment for the aforementioned factors. both short LTL (< Q1) and low CD34+ levels (< Q1) predicted adverse cardiovascular outcomes (death. myocardial infarction. coronary revascularization. or cerebrovascular events) independently of each other. with a hazard ratio of 1.8 and 95% confidence interval of 1.1 to 2.0. and a hazard ratio of 2.1 and 95% confidence interval of 1.3 to 3.0. respectively. comparing Q1 to Q2-4. Patients who had both short LTL (< Q1) and low CD34+ cell count (< Q1) had the greatest risk of adverse outcomes (hazard ratio = 3.5; 95% confidence interval. 1.7-7.1). Conclusions: Although shorter LTL is associated with decreased regenerative capacity. both LTL and circulating progenitor cell levels are independent and additive predictors of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in coronary artery disease patients. Our results suggest that both biological aging and reduced regenerative capacity contribute to cardiovascular events. independent of conventional risk factors....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Heart Disease
68,One of the most significant reliability issues in switching-mode power supplies is electrolytic capacitor degradation caused by aging. This paper proposes an output voltage transient analysis method to detect capacitor wear-out at the output stage of a step-down dc-dc converter. Changes in the converter output voltage dynamics are evaluated by analyzing the output voltage step response with respect to a decrease in the capacitance. The sensitivity of the method is assessed with respect to parameter variations using an equivalent main circuit model. The feasibility of the presented method is verified by experimental tests using a converter prototype. The results show that the presented method is practical and adequate for detecting capacitor degradation in various operating conditions....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Single-phase electric power
69,The detection of degradations and resulting failures in electronic components/systems is of paramount importance for complex industrial applications including nuclear power reactors. aerospace. automotive. and space applications. There is an increasing acceptance of the importance of detection of failures and degradations in electronic components and of the prospect of system-level health monitoring to make a key contribution to detecting and predicting any impending failures. This paper describes a parametric system identification-based health-monitoring method for detecting aging degradations of passive components in switch-mode power converters (SMPCs). A nonparametric system response is identified by perturbing the system with an optimized multitone sinusoidal signal of the order of mVs. The parametric system model is estimated from nonparametric system response using recursive weighted least-square (WLS) algorithm. Finally. the power-stage component values. including their parasitics. are extracted from numerator and denominator coefficients based on the assumed Laplace system model. These extracted component values provide direct diagnostic information of any degradation or anomalies in the components and the system. A proof of concept is initially verified on a simple point-of-load (POL) converter but the same methodology can be applied to other topologies of SMPC....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,System identification
70,Background-Circulating levels of chemerin are significantly higher in hypertensive patients and positively correlate with blood pressure. Chemerin activates chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1 or ChemR23) and is proposed to activate the "orphan" G protein-coupled receptor 1 (GPR1). which has been linked with hypertension. Our aim was to localize chemerin. CMKLR1. and GPR1 in the human vasculature and determine whether 1 or both of these receptors mediate vasoconstriction. Methods and Results-Using immunohistochemistry and molecular biology in conduit arteries and veins and resistance vessels. we localized chemerin to endothelium. smooth muscle. and adventitia and found that CMKLR1 and GPR1 were widely expressed in smooth muscle. C9 (chemerin149-157) contracted human saphenous vein (pD(2)=7.30 +/- 0.31) and resistance arteries (pD(2)=7.05 +/- 0.54) and increased blood pressure in rats by 9.1 +/- 1.0 mm Hg at 200 nmol. Crucially. these in vitro and in vivo vascular actions were blocked by CCX832. which we confirmed to be highly selective for CMKLR1 over GPR1. C9 inhibited cAMP accumulation in human aortic smooth muscle cells and preconstricted rat aorta. consistent with the observed vasoconstrictor action. Downstream signaling was explored further and. compared to chemerin. C9 showed a bias factor=approximate to 5000 for the Gi protein pathway. suggesting that CMKLR1 exhibits biased agonism. Conclusions-Our data suggest that chemerin acts at CMKLR1. but not GPR1. to increase blood pressure. Chemerin has an established detrimental role in metabolic syndrome. and these direct vascular actions may contribute to hypertension. an additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This study provides proof of principle for the therapeutic potential of selective CMKLR1 antagonists....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Heart Disease
71,Biofilm formation usually increases antimicrobial resistance capacity of Staphylococcus aureus. which poses considerable challenges to successful eradication of staphylococcal infections. Very little is known about the biofilm-forming capacity and antibiotic resistance pattern of dominant S. aureus clonal lineages in China. In this study. the disk diffusion method and the microtiter plate assay were. respectively. performed to determine the antibiotic resistance and biofilm-forming capacity of 84 different S. aureus isolates belonging to 10 dominant clonal lineages in China. It was shown that isolates of different clonal lineages had obvious variations in biofilm-forming capacity. Resistance to individual antibacterial agents was most frequently observed to erythromycin (72.6%) and azithromycin (72.6%). Then. all tested isolates were further screened for the presence of 16 resistance genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). and no significant correlation was found between clonal lineage and the distribution of resistance genes. Overall. our results indicate that biofilm producers of S. aureus have a greater likelihood to carry more antibiotic resistance genes than non-biofilm producers (p<.01). further implying that biofilm may promote the dissemination of antibiotic resistance determinants. Practical applicationsStaphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of nosocomial infections and often associated with food poisoning worldwide. Biofilm formation of S. aureus influences the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy and promotes the persistence of infections; however. the knowledge about biofilm formation capacity of isolates belonging to different clonal lineages is little. Therefore. this study on biofilm formation capacity and antibiotic resistance pattern of dominant S. aureus clonal lineages could help to fix this information gap....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,HIV/AIDS
72,Gene editing technologies are a group of recent innovations in plant breeding using molecular biology. which have in common the capability of introducing a site-directed mutation or deletion in the genome. The first cases of crops improved with these technologies are approaching the market; this has raised an international debate regarding if they should be regulated as genetically modified crops or just as another form of mutagenesis under conventional breeding. This dilemma for policymakers not only entails issues pertaining safety information and legal/regulatory definitions. It also demands borrowing tools developed in the field of social studies of science and technology. as an additional basis for sound decision making....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Genetics
73,BACKGROUNDWeeds can be a greater constraint to crop production than animal pests and pathogens. Pre-emergence herbicides are crucial in many cropping systems to control weeds that have evolved resistance to selective post-emergence herbicides. In this study we assessed the potential to evolve resistance to the pre-emergence herbicides prosulfocarb + S-metolachlor or pyroxasulfone in 50 individual field Lolium rigidum populations collected in a random survey in Western Australia prior to commercialisation of these pre-emergence herbicides. RESULTSThis study shows for the first time that in randomly collected L. rigidum field populations the selection with either prosulfocarb + S-metolachlor or pyroxasulfone can result in concomitant evolution of resistance to both prosulfocarb + S-metolachlor and pyroxasulfone after three generations. CONCLUSIONSIn the major weed L. rigidum. traits conferring resistance to new herbicides can be present before herbicide commercialisation. Proactive and multidisciplinary research (evolutionary ecology. modelling and molecular biology) is required to detect and analyse resistant populations before they can appear in the field. Several studies show that evolved cross-resistance in weeds is complex and often unpredictable. Thus. long-term management of cross-resistant weeds must be achieved through heterogeneity of selection by effective chemical. cultural and physical weed control strategies that can delay herbicide resistance evolution.

74,The Arabidopsis thaliana bZIP60 (AtbZIP60) transcription factor regulates stress signaling. However. its molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this investigation. cell suspension cultures of two different plant species rice (Oryza sativa L.) and white pine (Pinus strobes L.) were transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 harboring pBI-AtZIP60. Integration of the AtbZIP60 gene into the genome of rice and white pine has been confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). southern blotting. and northern blotting analyses. Six transgenic cell lines from O. sativa and three transgenic cell lines from P. strobus were used to analyze the salt. drought. and cold tolerance conferred by the overexpression of the AtbZIP60 gene. Our results demonstrated that expression of the AtbZIP60 gene enhanced salt. drought. and cold tolerance in rice and white pine transgenic cell lines. In rice. transcription factor AtbZIP60 increased expression of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase genes OsCPK6. OsCPK9. OsCPK10. OsCPK19. OsCPK25. and OsCPK26 under treatment of salt. drought. and cold. These results demonstrated that overexpression of the AtbZIP60 gene in transgenic cell lines improved salt. drought. and cold stress tolerances by regulating expression of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase genes. Overexpression of the AtbZIP60 gene could be an alternative choice for engineering plant abiotic stress tolerance....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
75,An efficient transformation system for Chinese cabbage cotyledon explants was developed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains LBA4404 harbouring the plasmid pMOG411 and the plasmid pBin Omega SCK respectively. Various factors affecting the transformation efficiency and subsequent regeneration were identified. The age of seedlings. growth conditions and status of Agrobacterium suspension. preculture of explants. cocultivation time. ratio between Agrobacterium and explants. acetosyringone and concentration of kanamycin had a significant influence on transformation frequency and plant regeneration. The presences of the antibacterial peptide gene and the cowpea trypsin inhibitor gene in those selected shoots in kanamycin medium were confirmed by PCR. Southern blotting and Northern blotting. The frequency of regeneration from cotyledons was analyzed in eight parental lines of Chinese cabbage and five lines were suitable for obtaining transformed plants. among which Qingmaye C and Qingmaye D were more responsive than other lines....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
76,'Mexican' lime (Citrus aurantifolia Swingle) was transformed with constructs that contained chimeric promoter-gus gene fusions of phloem-specific rolC promoter of Agrobacterium rhizogenes. Arabidopsis thaliana sucrose-H+ symporter (AtSUC2) gene promoter of Arabidopsis thaliana. rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) promoter and sucrose synthase l (RSs1) gene promoter of Oryza sativa (rice). Histochemical beta-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis revealed vascular-specific expression of the GUS protein in citrus. The RTBV promoter was the most efficient promoter in this study while the RSs1 promoter could drive low levels of gus gene expression in citrus. These results were further validated by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting. Southern blot analysis confirmed stable transgene integration. which ranged from a single insertion to four copies per genome. The use of phloem-specific promoters in citrus will allow targeted transgene expression of antibacterial constructs designed to battle huanglongbing disease (HLB or citrus greening disease). associated with a phloem-limited Gram-negative bacterium....,biochemistry,CS,Northern blotting,Computer vision
77,To improve the transformation efficiency of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. we explored the possibility of employing the basal portion of wheat seedling (shoot apical meristem) as the explants. Three genotypes of wheat were transformed by A. tumefaciens carrying beta-1. 3-glucanase gene. After vernalization. the seeds to be transformed were germinated. When these seedlings grew up to 2 similar to 5 cm. their coleoptile and half of the cotyledon were cut out. and the basal portions were infected by A. tumefaciens. A total 27 T-0 transgenic plants were obtained. and the average transformation efficiency was as high as 9.82%. Evident segregation occurred in some of the T-1 plants. as was indicated by PCR and Southern blotting analysis. Investigation of the T-2 plants revealed that some transformed plants had higher resistance to powdery mildew than the controls. Northern blotting revealed that beta-1. 3-glucanase gene was normally expressed in the T-2 plants. which showed an increased resistance to powdery mildew. The results above indicate that the exogenous gene has been successfully integrated into the genome of wheat. transmitted and expressed in the transgenic progeny. From all the results above. it can be concluded that Agrobacterium inoculum to the basal portion of wheat seedling is a highly efficient and dependable transformation method. It can be developed into a practicable method for transfer of target gene into wheat....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
78,Constantly elevated temperatures cause an array of physio-biochemical changes in tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum Mill.) which make the fruit ripen quickly and up to 50 % yield loss. The development of tomato cultivars. using genetic engineering approaches which delay ripening. offers a new way to keep tomatoes healthy under heat stress. Over-expression of small heat shock protein gene. viscosity 1 (vis 1) plays a role in increasing juice viscosity. early ripening and tissue soften which emphasizes the importance of this gene in premature ripening. The aim of this work was therefore to develop a useful system for silencing the vis1 gene using small interfering RNA strategy. Agrobacterium strain GV3101 harbouring the binary vector pICBV19 containing the gus and bar genes was used to adapt the transformation process in this study. The primers were designed to amplified the first exon of the vis 1 gene and the amplified fragment was used for cloning into the pFGC5941 at XhoI/NcoI site at sense orientation then additional fragment was subsequently cloned at BamHI/XbaI to form sense/antisense cloned fragment interrupted by the CHSA-intron Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 with the binary vector pFGC5941 which harbors vis1 gene under the control of the 35S promoter containing bar gene under the control of a mannopine synthase 2'(Mas2') as selectable marker. was used to reduce the expression of vis1 gene in fruit. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RT-PCR and northern blotting analysis were applied to detect putative transgenic plants. Significantly. silencing of vis 1 gene was potently occur and new transgenic tomato cultivars were produced with enhanced ripening qualities for recommendation for growing under heat stress....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
79,To induce virus resistance in tobacco and rice we constructed hairpin RNA expression system harbouring inverted repeat fragments of coat protein cDNA of Potato virus Y (PVY) or Rice stripe virus (RSV). These structures were driven by three promoters [cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV 35S). polyubiqutin gene of maize (Ubi). and Pharbitis nil leucine zipper gene (PNZIP)] which have different tissue-specific activity. PVY resistance ratios were 65.18. 24.33 and 83.54 % in transgenic tobacco plants harboring p35S-PVY. pUbi-PVY and pPNZIP-PVY. RSV resistance was 16.21. 28.61 and 29.33 % in transgenic rice plants harboring p35S-RSV. pUbi-RSV and pPNZIP-RSV. Northern blotting and GUS assay demonstrated that virus resistance levels were related to promoter activity. Therefore. choice of the more effective and tissue-specific promoter to reinforce transcription of hpRNAs will favour the cultivation of highly virusresistant transgenic plants....,biochemistry,CS,Northern blotting,Computer vision
80,Potato is one of the main targets for genetic improvement by gene transfer. The aim of the present study was to establish a robust protocol for the genetic transformation of three dihaploid and four economically important cultivars of potato using Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying the in vivo screenable reporter gene for green fluorescent protein (gfp) and the marker gene for neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII). Stem and leaf explants were used for transformation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 carrying the binary vector pHB2892. Kanamycin selection. visual screening of GFP by epifluorescent microscopy. PCR amplification of nptII and gfp genes. as well as RT-PCR and Southern blotting of gfp and Northern blotting of nptII. were used for transgenic plant selection. identification and analysis. Genetic transformation was optimized for the best performing genotypes with a mean number of shoots expressing gfp per explant of 13 and 2 (dihaploid line 178/10 and cv. 'Baltica'. respectively). The nptII marker and gfp reporter genes permitted selection and excellent visual screening of transgenic tissues and plants. They also revealed the effects of antibiotic selection on organogenesis and transformation frequency. and the identification of escapes and chimeras in all potato genotypes. Silencing of the gfp transgene that may represent site-specific inactivation during cell differentiation. occurred in some transgenic shoots of tetraploid cultivars and in specific chimeric clones of the dihaploid line 178/10. The regeneration of escapes could be attributed to either the protection of non-transformed cells by neighbouring transgenic cells. or the persistence of Agrobacterium cells in plant tissues after co-cultivation....,biochemistry,CS,Northern blotting,Computer vision
81,The Arabidopsis thaliana bZIP60 (AtbZIP60) transcription factor regulates stress signaling. pathogen defense. and flower development. However. molecular mechanism involved in plant salt tolerance via overexpression of transcription factor AtbZIP60 is elusive. In this investigation. cell suspension cultures of four different plant species cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana L.). white pine (Pinus strobus L.). and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were transformed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 harboring pBI-AtZIP60. Integration of AtbZIP60 into the genome of G. hirsutum. P. virginiana. P. strobes. and A. thaliana has been confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Southern blotting. and northern blotting analyses. Six transgenic cell lines from each of four species were used to analyze the salt tolerance conferred by the overexpression of AtbZIP60. Our results demonstrated that expression of AtbZIP60 enhanced salt tolerance of transgenic cells in all transgenic lines. and that improved salt tolerance was associated with increased activities of both H+-ATPase and acid phosphatase and decreased lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) in transgenic cell lines from cotton (Gh1. Gh2. Gh3. Gh4. Gh5. and Gh6). Virginia pine (Pv1. Pv2. Pv3. Pv4. Pv5. and Pv6). white pine (Ps1. Ps2. Ps3. Ps4. Ps5. and Ps6). and Arabidopsis (At1. At2. At3. At4. At5. and At6). This investigation demonstrated that the expression of AtbZIP60 gene in transgenic cell lines reduced salt-induced oxidative damage by increasing the activities of both H+-ATPase and acid phosphatase. and that the overexpression of AtbZIP60 gene could be valuable for engineering plant salt tolerance....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
82,The Arabidopsis thaliana bZIP60 (AtbZIP60) transcription factor regulates stress signaling. However. its involvement in plant salt tolerance is not fully understood. In this investigation. cell suspension cultures of three different plant species: tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). rice (Oryza sativa L.). and slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) were transformed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 harboring pBI-AtbZIP60deltaC. Integration of AtbZIP60deltaC into the genome of tobacco. rice. or slash pine has been confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Southern blotting. and Northern blotting analyses. Six transgenic cell lines from each of three species were used to analyze the salt tolerance conferred by the overexpression of AtbZIP60deltaC. Our results demonstrated that expression of AtbZIP60deltaC enhanced salt tolerance of transgenic cells in all transgenic lines and that improved salt tolerance was associated with increased activities of both ascorbate peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. and decreased lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances). This investigation has demonstrated that the expression of AtbZIP60deltaC gene in transgenic cell lines attenuated salt-induced oxidative damage by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the overexpression of AtbZIP60deltaC gene could be an alternative choice for engineering plant salt tolerance....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
83,The aim of the present study was to produce marker-free transgenic potato resistant to PVY by using a construct generating self-complementary hairpin RNAs. The method has two steps: 1) establishing a robust protocol for the genetic transformation of economically important cultivars of potato by using gfp and nptII genes; 2) applying the protocol for the transfer of marker-free hairpin construct and analysis of transgenic plants by PCR. In the first step internodes were transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 with pH82892 construct. Kanamycin. visual screening of GFP. PCR of nptII and gfp as well as RT-PCR and Southern blotting of gfp and Northern blotting of nptII were used for transgenic plant selection. Good regeneration and transformation efficiency were obtained for the cvs. Baltica and Desiree while the cvs. Agave and Delikat showed lower figures. In the second step A. tumefaciens with construct: 35SCaMV enhancer and promoter. two repeated inverted PVY-CP sequences separated by an intron and pAnos terminator was used Regenerated plants without selection. were analysed by PCR using primers in the: 35S promoter. promoter and hairpin region. or in both repeated PVY-CP sequences. A large number of transgenic plants were identified for the most responsive cv. Baltica (17 out of 33) and Desiree (23 out of 66). but only I for the cv. Agave (out of 3) and none for the cv. Delikat. This simple two-step strategy might be applied to generate marker-free transgenic plants in other cvs. or plant species....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
84,The disciplinary structure of research on complex problems related to human activities is supported by the fundaments of the social. life. and hard sciences. In this work. we looked at the development of scientific research in the field of biofuels. as a sustainable source of energy. searching for references regarding its scientific roots and social relevance. Scientific communications on biofuels published between 1998 and 2007 were analyzed using a combination of bibliometric methods and text mining techniques. This field of research was characterized as interdisciplinary. with marked social relevance. Our bibliometric analysis shows that. in this research subject. 132 different. interacting fields of knowledge overlap. with dominance of Chemistry. Engineering and Agricultural Sciences. Through the use of text mining techniques. this field was configured into three groups of Disciplinary Dimensions. The first and most influential group includes the Agricultural Sciences. Social Sciences. and Environmental Sciences. The second group. which gives the field its technological basis. includes Chemistry. Engineering. and Microbiology. The third group includes disciplines with emerging involvement in the field of biofuels: Biology and Biochemistry. Animal and Plant Sciences. Molecular Biology and Genetics. Economics. Material Sciences. Nanosciences and Nanotechnology. Geosciences. Physics. Humanities. Multidisciplinary Sciences. Mathematics. and Computer Sciences. This study suggests that the first group of Disciplinary Dimensions conforms to the elements that socially validate the progress of research in the field of biofuels. This study also proposes a metric that can be used to measure the interdisciplinarity and the social framing of any other research field....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Enzymology
85,The transport sector is one of the main sources of greenhouse gases. adding in Spain near a quarter of the total national emissions. the majority in road transport. Therefore. road contribution to climate change should be mitigated to achieve the proposed goals in the fight against climate change. Policies and strategies suggest several preventive mitigation options. but have paid little attention to compensatory mitigation. We have conducted a theoretical case study in a Spanish province. Segovia. estimating the carbon dioxide emissions in the road network between 2015 and 2050. and analysing different compensation possibilities through conservation agriculture. agroforestry. afforestation and hedgerow plantation. We have calculated carbon sequestration in the reference period and costs per tonne for each option. estimating the budget range of offsetting road carbon emission. and funding possibilities. especially through fuel taxes. The paper demonstrates that offsetting carbon emissions produced by roads in this area is technically possible and highly desirable. unifying carbon sequestration. biodiversity improvement and rural development. The main challenge is funding. which depends largely on the political will and the awareness of the citizens. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

86,African horse sickness (AHS) is a fatal disease of equids relevant to the global equine industry. Detection of AHS virus (AHSV) during outbreaks has become more rapid and efficient with the advent of group specific reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (GS RT-qPCR) assays to detect AHSV nucleic acid. Use of GS RT-qPCR together with recently described type specific (TS RT-qPCR) assays cannot only expedite diagnosis of AHS but also facilitate further evaluation of the dynamics of AHSV infection in the equine host. A potential limitation to the application of these assays is that they detect viral nucleic acid originating from any AHS live attenuated vaccine (LAV). which is the vaccine type routinely administered to horses in South Africa. The aim of this study was to contrast the dynamics and duration of the RNAaemia to the serological responses of horses following immunization with a commercial polyvalent AHSV-LAV using GS and TS RT-qPCR assays and serum neutralisation tests. The results of the study showed extended RNAemia in vaccinated horses. and that more horses tested positive on GS RT-qPCR with lower Cq values after receiving the AHSV-LAV containing types 1. 3 and 4 prior to the vaccine containing types 2. 6. 7 and 8. rather than when the vaccine combinations were reversed. Furthermore. lower Cq values were obtained when vaccines were administered 4 weeks apart as compared with a longer interval or 12 weeks apart. These findings are of particular relevance in regions where AHSV-LAVs are used as the use of these vaccines may complicate the accurate interpretation of diagnostic testing results.

87,BACKGROUND The time of progression towards AIDS can vary greatly among seropositive patients. and may be associated with host genetic variation. The NR1I2 (PXR) gene. a ligand-activated transcription factor. regulates the transcription immune pathway genes and can therefore be targets of viral replication mechanisms influencing time of progression to AIDS. OBJECTIVE To verify the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs3814057. rs6785049. rs7643645. and rs2461817 in the NR1I2 (PXR) gene with progression to AIDS in HIV-1 infected patients. METHODS Blood samples were obtained from 96 HIV-1 positive individuals following informed consent. DNA was isolated and genotyped through real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of SNPs in the NR1I2. Questionnaires on socio-demographic features and behaviors were answered and time of progression to AIDS was estimated based on medical chart analysis. FINDINGS Patients with the GG genotype for rs7643645 were shown to be related with a more rapid disease progression when compared to GA and AA genotypes. This result was maintained by the Multivariate Cox Regression considering sex. ethnicity. and presence of HLA-B*57. HLA-B*27. and CCR5del32 polymorphisms. MAIN CONCLUSIONS Recent studies reported the expression of the nuclear receptors in T-Lymphocytes. suggesting their possible role in the immune response. In addition. nuclear receptors have been shown to inhibit the HIV replication. although no such mechanism has been thoroughly elucidated to date. This is the first time an association between NR1I2 polymorphism and time of progression to AIDS is reported and supports an apparent relationship between the gene in the immune response and identifies another genetic factor influencing AIDS progression....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,HIV/AIDS
88,Background: The presence of gross deletions in the human immunodeficiency virus nef gene (g Delta nef) is associated with long-term nonprogression of infected patients. Here. we investigated how quickly genetic defects in the nef gene are associated with Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) intake in 10 long-term slow progressors. Methods: This study was divided into three phases over a 20-yr period; baseline. KRG intake alone. and KRG plus highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART). nef gene amplicons were obtained using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested PCR from 10 long-term slow progressors (n = 1.396). and nested PCR from 36 control patients (n = 198). and 28 ART patients (n = 157). and these were then sequenced. The proportion of g Delta nef. premature stop codons. and not in-frame insertion or deletion of a nucleotide was compared between three phases. control. and ART patients. Results: The proportion of defective nef genes was significantly higher in on-KRG patients (15.6%) than in baseline (5.7%). control (5.6%). on-KRG plus ART phase (7.8%). and on-ART patients (6.6%; p < 0.01). Small in-frame deletions or insertions were significantly more frequent among patients treated with KRG alone compared with controls (p < 0.01). Significantly fewer instances of genetic defects were detected in samples taken during the KRG plus ART phase (7.8%; p < 0.01). The earliest defects detected were g Delta nef and small in-frame deletions after 7 mo and 67 mo of KRG intake. respectively. Conclusion: KRG treatment might induce genetic defects in the nef gene.

89,Background: CSF PCR is the standard diagnostic technique used in resource-rich settings to detect pathogens of the CNS infection. However. it is not currently used for routine CSF testing in China. Knowledge of CNS opportunistic infections among people living with HIV in China is limited. Methods: Intensive cerebrospiral fluid (CSF) testing was performed to evaluate for bacterial. viral and fungal etiologies. Pathogen-specific primers were used to detect DNA from cytomegalovirus (CMV). herpes simplex virus (HSV). varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and John Cunningham virus (JCV) via real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Cryptococcal meningitis accounted for 63.0% (34 of 54) of all causes of meningitis. 13.0% (7/54) for TB. 9.3% (5/54) for Toxoplasma gondii. Of 54 samples sent for viral PCR. 31.5% (17/54) were positive. 12 (22.2%) for CMV. 2 (3.7%) for VZV. 1 (1.9%) for EBV. 1 (1.9%) for HHV-6 and 1 (1.9%) for JCV. No patient was positive for HSV. Pathogen-based treatment and high GCS score tended to have a lower mortality rate. whereas patients with multiple pathogens infection. seizures or intracranial hypertension showed higher odds of death. Conclusion: CNS OIs are frequent and multiple pathogens often coexist in CSF. Cryptococcal meningitis is the most prevalent CNS disorders among AIDS. The utility of molecular diagnostics for pathogen identification combined with the knowledge provided by the investigation may improve the diagnosis of AIDS related OIs in resource-limited developing countries. but the cost-efficacy remains to be further evaluated....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,HIV/AIDS
90,Three novel differential amplifier topologies using double gate a-IGZO TFTs on flexible substrate are presented in this paper. The designs exploit positive feedback and a load with self-biased top gate to achieve the highest static gain in single stage a-IGZO amplifiers reported to date. After fabrication. the three amplifiers exhibit respectively a static gain of 14 dB. 21.5 dB. and 30 dB. with a bandwidth of 2 kHz. 400 Hz. and 150 Hz. Also. for each circuit the input referred noise has been measured to be 420 mu V-rms. 195 mu V-rms. and 146 mu V-rms. respectively. Based on these results. the a-IGZO amplifier providing the highest gain is suitable as front-end for heart rate measurements and. with some further optimization verified in simulation. can also be used for other bio-potential applications. like electro hysterogram and electro cardiogram....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Operational amplifier
91,Typical variable air volume (VAV) terminals spend the majority of time at their minimum airflow set points. These are often higher than the minimum ventilation requirements defined by code. resulting in excess energy use and a risk of over-cooling the spaces. We developed and tested a time-averaged ventilation (TAV) control strategy in an institutional building on the UC Berkeley campus to address this issue. Whenever a zone does not require cooling. TAV alternates the VAV damper between partially open and fully closed so that the average airflow matches a predefined ventilation setpoint. Compared to the existing. base case scenario using single-max VAV logic. this strategy reduced the mean zone airflow fraction from 0.44 to 0.27 during the intervention period. The corresponding reductions in average heating. cooling. and fan power were 41%. 23%. and 15% respectively. In addition to being programmed directly in a native control system. TAV may be applied via sMAP as a low-cost retrofit strategy in any building that has a BACnet network and direct digital control (DDC) to each VAV terminal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

92,Numerous studies have reported an association between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and human health. Often these relationships are influenced by environmental factor that varies spatially and/or temporally. To our knowledge. there are no studies in Canada that have considered energy generation and fuel sales as PM2.5 effects modifiers. Determining exposure and disease-specific risk factors over space and time is crucial for disease prevention and control. In this study. we evaluated the association of PM2.5 with diabetes. asthma. and High Blood Pressure (HBP) incidence in Canada. Then we explored the impact of the energy generation and fuel sales on association changes. We fit an age-period-cohort as the study design. and We applied an over-dispersed Poisson regression model to estimate the risk. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of variation in clean energy rates and fuel sales on outcomes changes. The study included 117 health regions in Canada between 2007 and 2014. Our findings showed strong association of PM2.5 with diabetes. asthma. and HBP incidence. A two-year increase of 10 mu g/m(3) in PM2.5 was associated with an increased risk of 534% (95% CI: 2.28%; 12.53%) in diabetes incidence. 2.24% (95% CI: 0.93%; 538%) in asthma incidence. and 8.29% (95% CI: 3.44%; 19.98%) in HBP incidence. Our sensitivity analysis findings suggest higher risks of diabetes. asthma and HBP incidence when there is low clean energy generation. On the other hand. we found lower risk when we considered high rate of clean energy generation. For example. considering only diabetes incidence. we found that the risk in health regions with low rates of clean electricity is approximately 700% higher than the risk in health regions with high rates of clean electricity. Furthermore. our analysis suggested that the risk in regions with low fuel sales is 66% lower than the risk is health regions with low rates of clean electricity. Our study provides support for the creation of effective environmental health public policies that take into account the risk factors present in Canadians health regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

93,Effectively analyzing and then treating energy-related air pollution requires examining every factor. from the pollution source to the end of treatment. This paper applies index decomposition analysis and a whole process treatment perspective to identify the factors facilitating air pollution reduction across three stages: source prevention. process control. and end-of-pipe treatment. Empirical research using data from China's Jiangsu Province and its 13 cities reveals differences in local approaches to pollution prevention. At the provincial level. end-of-pipe treatment remains the primary approach to control air pollution emissions. indicating that the pattern of "pollute first. govern later" has not yet been fundamentally reversed. At the city level. 13 cities can be divided into four types. based on their approach to air pollution treatment: the leading type. process-dependent type. end-dependent type. and lagging type. Of these. 7 cities are using multiple control approaches. reflecting the comprehensive effect of whole process treatment. The Jiangsu Province should consider further strengthening effective whole process air pollution treatment models. by transitioning to pollution control. adjusting industrial structure. promoting technological progress. and consuming clean energy.

94,The paper presents the design and some results for an experimental platform aimed to control the air pressure inside a small tank. The basic idea is to allow to the control algorithm to select an appropriate characteristic of the controller driving the air compressor. from an available set. In this first approach. the goal is to make functional the hardware circuits and to design the software support inside an Integrated Development Environment with a Very High Level Programming Language. After some functional tests. future work is intended to implement artificial intelligent based algorithms in order to exploit the multicharacteristics features with a fuzzy decisions set for selecting an optimal control. The main parts of the controller are an industrial pressure sensor. a PIC (TM) 16F877 microcontroller from Microchip (TM) and the air pressure part consisting. mainly. from a car compressor and a small tank. Additional elements make the operation safe. The solution with the microcontroller is put in operation in parallel with another one. using an industrial digital controller from Honeywell (TM).

95,BACKGROUNDFilling creams can provide an adequate substrate for spoilage yeasts because some yeasts can tolerate the high osmotic stress in these products. To discover the source of spoilage of a cream-filled baked product. end products. raw materials. indoor air and work surfaces were subjected to microbiological and molecular analyses. The efficacy of disinfectants against spoilage yeasts was also assessed. RESULTSThe analyses on end products revealed the presence of the closest relatives to Zygosaccharomyces bailii with counts ranging from 1.40 to 4.72logcfug(-1). No spoilage yeasts were found in the indoor air and work surfaces. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis. carried out directly on filling creams collected from unopened cans. showed the presence of bands ascribed to the closest relatives to Z.bailii sensu lato. although with counts<1logcfug(-1). Susceptibility testing of yeast isolates to disinfectants showed a significantly lower effect of 10% alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride. Different responses of isolates to the tested disinfectants were seen. CONCLUSIONTo guarantee the quality of end products. reliable and sensitive methods must be used. Moreover. hygiene and the application of good manufacturing practices represent the most efficient way for the prevention and minimization of cross-contamination.

97,Autoimmune regulator (Aire) is essential in the perinatal period to prevent the multiorgan autoimmunity. Here we show that Aire-regulated single positive thymocyte trafficking in neonatal period is critical for thymic egress. Reduced thymic emigration was found in Aire(-/-) mice during neonatal period. leading to enhanced homeostatic expansion of peripheral T cells as early as 2 weeks of age. In neonatal Aire(-/-) mice. thymic expression of CCR7 ligands were dramatically reduced. resulting in decreased thymocyte motility and thymocyte emigration. This reduction of thymic egress in Aire(-/-) mice was alleviated beyond 3 weeks of age by an early upregulation of S1P(1) signaling. As the numbers and quality of thymic emigrants are essential for the establishment and maintenance of peripheral tolerance. the reduced thymic emigration during neonatal period may deteriorate autoimmunity caused by the emigration of autoreactive T cells....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Rheumatoid Arthritis
98,BACKGROUND: Characterizing associations between the upper and lower airways is important for asthma management. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the determinants of incomplete asthma control in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma. METHODS: Multiple factors including age. sex. atopy. smoking history. medication use. Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score. FEV1. fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (F-ENO). and rhinitis questionnaire score were examined. AR was defined by rhinitis symptoms and the sensitization to inhaled allergens. ACQ was used to dichotomize the subjects into the incompletely controlled group (ACQ score >= 0.75) and the well-controlled group. The factors that contribute to incomplete asthma control were assessed by a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 260 patients with AR and asthma were enrolled and 108 patients (42%) were classified as incomplete asthma control. The incompletely controlled group was older (P<.05). and had more airflow limitation. more airway inflammation. and more severe rhinitis symptoms (all P<.001). In contrast. the well-controlled group was more likely to be taking nasal corticosteroids (NCSs) (P<.01). In a multivariate model adjusted by age. asthma treatment. airflow limitation. and FENO. persistence and severity of rhinitis (odds ratio [OR]. 2.57; 95% CI. 1.41-4.70. and OR. 2.00; 95% CI. 1.10-3.65) and nonuse of NCSs (OR. 3.83; 95% CI. 1.50-9.81) were independently associated with incomplete asthma control. CONCLUSIONS: The persistence and severity of AR and the use of NCSs were associated with the level of asthma control in patients with AR and asthma. Further studies are required to determine whether appropriate treatment of rhinitis would improve asthma control. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy.

99,Background: Asthma is characterized by a heterogeneous inflammatory profile and can be subdivided into T(h) 2-high and T(h) 2-low airway inflammation. Profiling of a broader panel of airway cytokines in large unselected patient cohorts is lacking. Methods: Patients (n = 205) were defined as being "cytokine-low/high" if sputum mRNA expression of a particular cytokine was outside the respective 10th/90th percentile range of the control group (n = 80). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was used to determine clusters based on sputum cytokine profiles. Results: Half of patients (n = 108; 52.6%) had a classical T(h) 2-high ("IL-4-. IL-5-and/or IL-13-high") sputum cytokine profile. Unsupervised cluster analysis revealed 5 clusters. Patients with an "IL-4-and/or IL-13-high"pattern surprisingly did not cluster but were equally distributed among the 5 clusters. Patients with an "IL-5-. IL-17A-/F-and IL-25-high"profile were restricted to cluster 1 (n = 24) with increased sputum eosinophil as well as neutrophil counts and poor lung function parameters at baseline and 2 years later. Four other clusters were identified: "IL-5-high or IL-10-high"(n = 16). "IL-6-high"(n = 8). "IL-22-high"(n = 25). Cluster 5 (n = 132) consists of patients without "cytokine-high"pattern or patients with only high IL-4 and/or IL-13. Conclusion: We identified 5 unique asthma molecular phenotypes by biological clustering. Type 2 cytokines cluster with non-type 2 cytokines in 4 out of 5 clusters. Unsupervised analysis thus not supports a priori type 2 versus non-type 2 molecular phenotypes....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Mental Health
0,Aluminium (Al) toxicity is a worldwide problem in agricultural practice. Based on evidence that Al resistance may be an inducible process and that rice is one of the most Al-resistant crops. the gene transcriptional responses to Al were investigated in two contrasting rice cultivars (resistant XN1 versus sensitive XX2) using differential display reverse transcription-PCR (DDRT-PCR) in combination with northern blotting analysis. A total of 37 genes were identified as differentially expressed. of which five have been previously known as Al regulated while the others are novel genes. Among the up-regulated genes. four encode ion transporters. two are involved in signal transduction. and five in the synthesis of cysteine and metallothionein. These could be members that are potentially involved in Al adaptation or resistance. On the other hand. the transcription of 17 genes was strongly inhibited under Al stress. These genes are associated with cytoskeletal dynamics and metabolism. and could be possible targets associated with Al toxicity. All of these differentially expressed genes may represent candidates that function in Al responses. The results suggest. at the transcriptional level. that cytoskeletal disruption may be associated with Al toxicity. whereas ion transport and sulphur metabolism could play major roles in Al adaptation or tolerance in rice....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
1,Properly designed alarm systems can benefit operators in conducting routine and emergency tasks. With the digitization of main control rooms. the alarm interface can be designed in various ways that are different from the traditional "alarm tile" style. An innovative alarm bar interface is proposed in this paper. A preliminary lab experiment was conducted to compare the traditional alarm tile and the new alarm bar interfaces. Sixteen university students were recruited to participate in the experiment. in which two emergency scenarios. Loss of Coolant Accident and Steam Generator Tube Rupture. were tested. The experiment task included two parts: alarm detection and identification. The subjective ratings supported the innovative alarm bar design for better parameter trend perception. The objective performance measures showed that the simpler design of the alarm tile interface better aided the alarm detection performance. whereas the alarm bar interface had almost the same alarm identification performance as the alarm tile interface. Relevance to industry: An alarm system is critical for a complex industrial system. The experimental results show that design evaluation is more complex than it may seem. Although it has not been proved to be overwhelmingly superior to the tile design. the alarm bar design shows promise for aiding operators and needs to be further validated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

2,PurposeMore than 25% of US adults experience mental health or substance use conditions annually. yet less than half receive treatment. This study explored how rural participants with behavioral health conditions pursue and receive care. and it examined how these factors differed across American Indian (AI) and geographic subpopulations. MethodsWe undertook a qualitative follow-up study from a statewide survey of unmet mental health and substance use needs in South Dakota. We conducted semistructured phone interviews with a purposive sample of key informants with varying perceptions of need for mental health and substance use treatment. ResultsWe interviewed 33 participants with mental health (n = 18). substance use (n = 9). and co-occurring disorders (n = 6). Twenty participants (61.0%) lived in rural communities that did not overlap with AI tribal land. Twelve participants (34.3%) were AI. 8 of whom lived on a reservation (24.2%). The discrepancy between actual and perceived treatment need was related to how participants defined mental health. alcohol. and drug use problems. Mental health disorders and excessive alcohol consumption were seen as a normal part of life in rural and reservation communities; seeking mental health care or maintaining sobriety was viewed as the result of an individual's willpower and frequently related to a substantial life event (eg. childbirth). Participants recommended treatment gaps be addressed through multicomponent community-level interventions. DiscussionThis study describes how rural populations view mental health. alcohol. and drug use. Enhancing access to care. addressing discordant perceptions. and improving community-based interventions may increase treatment uptake....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Schizophrenia
3,Alcohol and substance (drugs and/or alcohol) abuse are major risk factors for traumatic brain injury (TBI); however. it remains unclear whether outcomes differ for those with and without a history of preinjury abuse. A meta-analysis was performed to examine this issue. The PubMed. Embase. and PsycINFO databases were searched for research that compared the neuroradiological. cognitive. or psychological outcomes of adults with and without a documented history of alcohol and/or substance abuse who sustained nonpenetrating TBIs. Data from 22 studies were analyzed using a random-effects model: Hedges's g effect sizes measured the mean difference in outcomes of individuals with/without a history of preinjury abuse. and Bayes factors assessed the probability that the outcomes differed. Patients with a history of alcohol and/or substance abuse had poorer neuroradiological outcomes. including reduced hippocampal (g=-0.82) and gray matter volumes (g=-0.46 to -0.82). and enlarged cerebral ventricles (g=-0.73 to -0.80). There were limited differences in cognitive outcomes: Executive functioning (g=-0.51) and memory (g=-0.39 to -0.43) were moderately affected. but attention and reasoning were not. The findings for fine motor ability. construction. perception. general cognition. and language were inconclusive. Postinjury substance and alcohol use (g=-0.97 to -1.07) and emotional functioning (g=-0.29 to -0.44) were worse in those with a history of alcohol and/or substance abuse (psychological outcomes). This study highlighted the type and extent of post-TBI differences between persons with and without a history of alcohol or substance abuse. many of which may hamper recovery. However. variation in the criteria for premorbid abuse. limited information regarding the history of abuse. and an absence of preinjury baseline data prevented an assessment of whether the differences predated the TBI. occurred as a result of ongoing alcohol/substance abuse. or reflected the cumulative impact of alcohol/substance abuse and TBI....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Addiction
4,Pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) enzymes are responsible for the operation of ethanolic fermentation pathway that appears to correlate to an extent with anoxia tolerance in plants. This study was undertaken with the objective of (a) analysing the rice pdc gene family and (b) altering the efficacy of the ethanolic fermentation process. through production of transgenic rice plants over- and under-expressing pyruvate decarboxylase (employing Ospdc1 gene from rice) as well as over-expressing alcohol dehydrogenase (employing Ghadh2 gene from cotton) proteins. Correlations noted in this study between the pattern of expression of the Pdc alpha-subunit and Ospdc2 transcript as well as between the Pdc beta-subunit and Ospdc1 transcript suggest the possibility that alpha-subunit is encoded by Ospdc2 and that beta-subunit is encoded by Ospdc1. The fact that levels of Pdc beta-subunit were particularly high in pUH-sPdc1 (plasmid construct designed for over-expression of Ospdc1) seedlings while levels of beta-subunit levels were negligible or lower in pUH-asPdc1 (plasmid construct designed for under-expression of Ospdc1) seedlings also support these observations.

5,Background: Prior research has repeatedly shown that alcohol dependence is associated with a large range of impairments in psychological processes. which could lead to interpersonal deficits. Specifically. it has been suggested that these interpersonal difficulties are underpinned by reduced recognition and sharing of others' emotional states. However. this pattern of deficits remains to be clarified. This study thus aimed to investigate whether alcohol dependence is associated with impaired abilities in decoding contextual complex emotions and with altered sharing of others' emotions. Methods: Forty-one alcohol-dependent individuals (ADI) and 37 matched healthy individuals completed the Multifaceted Empathy Test. in which they were instructed to identify complex emotional states expressed by individuals in contextual scenes and to state to what extent they shared them. Results: Compared to healthy individuals. ADI were impaired in identifying negative (Cohen's d=0.75) and positive (Cohen's d=0.46) emotional states but. conversely. presented preserved abilities in sharing others' emotional states. Conclusions: This study shows that alcohol dependence is characterized by an impaired ability to decode complex emotional states (both positive and negative). despite the presence of complementary contextual cues. but by preserved emotion-sharing. Therefore. these results extend earlier data describing an impaired ability to decode noncontextualized emotions toward contextualized and ecologically valid emotional states. They also indicate that some essential emotional competences such as emotion-sharing are preserved in alcohol dependence. thereby offering potential therapeutic levers....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition

7,Considerable evidence has identified biased cognitive processing of alcohol-related stimuli as an important factor in the maintenance of alcohol-seeking and relapse among individuals suffering from alcohol use-disorders (AUDs). In addition. a large body of research has demonstrated that exposure to alcohol cues can elicit powerful alcohol cravings. Little is known. however. about the possible relationship between attentional bias and cue-induced cravings. and even less is known about these processes in social drinkers without a personal history of AUDs. The goal of this study was to examine the possibility that attentional biases toward alcohol-related stimuli would predict elevated cue-induced alcohol craving in this population. Young adult social drinkers (N = 30. Mean age = 22.8 +/- 1.9. 61% female) recruited from an urban university population completed a visual dot probe task in which they were presented with alcohol and neutral stimulus pictures that were immediately followed by a visual probe replacing one of the pictures. Attentional bias was measured by calculating reaction times to probes that replaced alcohol stimuli vs. neutral stimuli. Participants then completed a classic alcohol cue-exposure task and reported cravings immediately before and after alcohol and neutral cue-exposures. Not surprisingly. exposure to alcohol cues elicited significant cravings. Consistent with the study hypothesis. larger attentional biases toward alcohol stimuli predicted higher levels of alcohol craving. Findings demonstrate that heightened attention to alcohol stimuli can significantly impact motivation to consume in healthy young adults. and suggest a possible pathway linking cognitive processes early in the drinking trajectory to the later development of AUDs.

8,AimsTo examine the association between a life-time history of insomnia and hypersomnia compared with no sleep disturbance and substance use patterns and amounts before and after a substance use treatment episode. DesignSecondary analysis of data from the Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Studies conducted from 1991 to 1994. SettingData were collected at 96 substance use treatment programs in 11 United States cities. including short-term in-patient. long-term residential. methadone maintenance and out-patient drug-free treatment modalities. ParticipantsStudy samples included 7168 adults at treatment entry and 2965 at 12months post-treatment entry whose primary substance use at entry was alcohol (14.7%). cocaine (62.7%) or heroin (22.6%). MeasurementsLife-time history of insomnia and hypersomnia was assessed via self-report. Type and frequency of substance use were assessed at treatment entry. Substance use was also assessed 12months following treatment completion. Associations were examined using linear and logistic regression with age. sex. race. education level. depression history. treatment modality and in-treatment substance use as covariates. FindingsLife-time history of insomnia. hypersomnia. both or neither was reported by 26.3. 9.5. 28.0 and 36.2% of participants. respectively. Compared with no sleep disturbance. life-time insomnia and hypersomnia were associated at treatment entry with unique substance use patterns and a higher frequency of any substance use (P<0.001). All types of sleep disturbance were associated with higher rates of cocaine use at 12-month post-entry (odds ratios: 1.30-1.57). ConclusionsThere is evidence of an adverse association between substance use and sleep disturbance including higher frequency of all substance use before substance abuse treatment and higher rates of cocaine use after a treatment episode....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Addiction
9,Rationale Social cognition influences social interactions. Alcohol reportedly facilitates social interactions. However. the acute effects of alcohol on social cognition are relatively poorly studied. We investigated the effects of alcoholic or non-alcoholic beer on emotion recognition. empathy. and sexual arousal using the dynamic face emotion recognition task (FERT). Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET). and Sexual Arousal Task (SAT) in a double-blind. random-order. cross-over study in 60 healthy social drinkers. We also assessed subjective effects using visual analog scales (VASs). blood alcohol concentrations. and plasma oxytocin levels. Alcohol increased VAS ratings of stimulated. happy. talkative. open. and want to be with others. The subjective effects of alcohol were greater in participants with higher trait inhibitedness. Alcohol facilitated the recognition of happy faces on the FERT and enhanced emotional empathy for positive stimuli on the MET. particularly in participants with low trait empathy. Pictures of explicit sexual content were rated as less pleasant than neutral pictures after non-alcoholic beer but not after alcoholic beer. Explicit sexual pictures were rated as more pleasant after alcoholic beer compared with non-alcoholic beer. particularly in women. Alcohol did not alter the levels of circulating oxytocin. Alcohol biased emotion recognition toward better decoding of positive emotions and increased emotional concern for positive stimuli. No support was found for a modulatory role of oxytocin. Alcohol also facilitated the viewing of sexual images. consistent with disinhibition. but it did not actually enhance sexual arousal. These effects of alcohol on social cognition likely enhance sociability. www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02318823 RefTarget Address="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02318823" TargetType="URL"/>...,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
10,Background and aimsHIV-infected people with substance use disorders are least likely to benefit from advances in HIV treatment. Integration of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) into HIV clinics may increase engagement in the HIV care continuum by decreasing substance use. We aimed to compare (1) XR-NTX treatment initiation. (2) retention and (3) safety of XR-NTX versus treatment as usual (TAU) for treating opioid use disorder (OUD) and/or alcohol use disorder (AUD) in HIV clinics. DesignNon-blinded randomized trial of XR-NTX versus pharmacotherapy TAU. SettingHIV primary care clinics in Vancouver. BC. Canada and Chicago. IL. USA. ParticipantsFifty-one HIV-infected patients seeking treatment for OUD (n=16). AUD (n=27) or both OUD and AUD (n=8). MeasurementsPrimary outcomes were XR-NTX initiation (receipt of first injection within 4weeks of randomization) and retention at 16weeks. Secondary outcomes generated point estimates for change in substance use. HIV viral suppression [HIV RNA polymerase chain reaction (pcr)<200 copies/ml] and safety. FindingsTwo-thirds (68%) of participants assigned to XR-NTX initiated treatment. and 88% of these were retained on XR-NTX at 16weeks. In comparison. 96% of TAU participants initiated treatment. but only 50% were retained on medication at 16weeks. Mean days of opioid use in past 30 days decreased from 17.3 to 4.1 for TAU and from 20.3 to 7.7 for XR-NTX. Mean heavy drinking days decreased from 15.6 to 5.7 for TAU and 12.5 to 2.8 for XR-NTX. Among those with OUD. HIV suppression improved from 67 to 80% for XR-NTX and 58 to 75% for TAU. XR-NTX was well tolerated. with no precipitated withdrawals and one serious injection-site reaction. ConclusionsExtended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is feasible and safe for treatment of opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder in HIV clinics. Treatment initiation appears to be lower and retention greater for XR-NTX compared with treatment as usual ( NCT01908062)....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Addiction

12,One-step aldol condensation of methyl acetate with formaldehyde (or trioxane) for preparing methyl acrylate at 623 K-653 K has stimulated researchers' attention in recent years. Herein. a new methodology for one-step synthesis of methyl acrylate from methyl acetate and trioxane promoted by generated trifluoromethanesulfonate ionic liquid. via aldol condensation. at mild temperature was developed. The kinetic and thermodynamic studies on this new process were also firstly investigated systematically. Experiments were conducted in a batch reactor under the temperatures of 283 K-298 K and reaction times of 10 min - 100 min. wherein the side reactions could be ignored. The proposed mechanism based kinetic model was established and simulated with experimental data. The model showed good agreement with experimental results within the range of acceptable deviation. thereby the pre exponential factor and activation energy of each reaction step were obtained. Moreover. the equilibrium constant and enthalpy change of each reversible reaction were also calculated through Van't Hoff formula. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

13,Background: Inflammation is a key feature of aldosterone-induced vascular damage and dysfunction. but molecular mechanisms by which aldosterone triggers inflammation remain unclear. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a pivotal immune sensor that recognizes endogenous danger signals triggering sterile inflammation. Methods: We analyzed vascular function and inflammatory profile of wild-type (WT). NLRP3 knockout (NLRP3(-/-)). caspase-1 knockout (Casp-1(-/-)). and interleukin-1 receptor knockout (IL-1R(-/-)) mice treated with vehicle or aldosterone (600 mu gkg(-1)d(-1) for 14 days through osmotic mini-pump) while receiving 1% saline to drink. Results: Here. we show that NLRP3 inflammasome plays a central role in aldosterone-induced vascular dysfunction. Long-term infusion of aldosterone in mice resulted in elevation of plasma interleukin-1 levels and vascular abnormalities. Mice lacking the IL-1R or the inflammasome components NLRP3 and caspase-1 were protected from aldosterone-induced vascular damage. In vitro. aldosterone stimulated NLRP3-dependent interleukin-1 secretion by bone marrow-derived macrophages by activating nuclear factor-B signaling and reactive oxygen species generation. Moreover. chimeric mice reconstituted with NLRP3-deficient hematopoietic cells showed that NLRP3 in immune cells mediates aldosterone-induced vascular damage. In addition. aldosterone increased the expression of NLRP3. active caspase-1. and mature interleukin-1 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Hypertensive patients with hyperaldosteronism or normal levels of aldosterone exhibited increased activity of NLRP3 inflammasome. suggesting that the effect of hyperaldosteronism on the inflammasome may be mediated through high blood pressure. Conclusions: Together. these data demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome. through activation of IL-1R. is critically involved in the deleterious vascular effects of aldosterone. placing NLRP3 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in conditions with high aldosterone levels....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Heart Disease
14,Aldosterone has been shown to stimulate renal TGF-beta(1) expression. However. the mechanisms for aldosterone-induced TGF-beta(1) expression have not been clearly determined in mesangial cells. We examined the role of extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) in the aldosterone-induced TGF-beta(1) expression in rat mesangial cells. TGF-beta(1) protein in the conditioned medium released from rat mesangial cells was measured by sandwich ELISA. TGF-beta(1) mRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blotting. AP-1 DNA binding activity was measured by EMSA and the ERK1/2. JNK activity was analyzed by western blotting. Aldosterone significantly stimulated TGF-beta(1) protein production and TGF-beta(1) mRNA expression in mesangial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Aldosterone significantly increased AP-1 DNA binding activity in mesangial cells. Pre-treatment of cells with AP-1 inhibitor. curcumin. blocked aldosterone-induced AP-1 DNA binding activity as well as aldosterone-induced TGF-beta(1) production. Aldosterone increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK in mesangial cells. Pre-treatment of cells with ERK1/2 inhibitor. PD98059. or JNK inhibitor. SP600125 significantly inhibited aldosterone-induced ERK1/2 and JNK activity and subsequently TGF-beta(1) production. respectively. We conclude that aldosterone-induced TGF-beta(1) expression in mesangial cells is regulated by the ERK1/2. JNK and AP-1 intracellular signaling pathways....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Kidney Health
15,The objective of this study was to measure the effect of selection for tolerance on the severity of the Aleutian disease (AD) lesions in mink. Sensitivity and specificity of antibody detection in the blood by counter-immunoelectrophoresis (CIEP) relative to the presence of Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV) in the spleen by PCR in naturally infected farmed mink were also estimated. Carcasses of 680 sero-positive (CIEP-P) black mink from 28 farms in Nova Scotia. Canada. and from 132 sero-negative (CIEP-N) mink from 14 of these farms were collected at pelting time. A total of 116 of the CIEP-P mink were from three farms where animals have been selected for tolerating AD for almost 20 years. The severity of the AD lesions was assessed by histopathological examination of kidneys. lungs. heart. brain and liver on a scale of 0 to 4. Sensitivity and specificity of CIEP relative to PCR were 0.97 and 0.85. respectively. and 16.5% of CIEP-N mink were PCR positive. which could be one of the reasons for the failure of virus eradication by CIEP in Canada. The CIEP-N and tolerant CIEP-P animals had 9.39 and 6.23 greater odds of showing lower lesion severity. respectively. than the CIEP-P animals (P < 0.01). The CIEP-N mink had a slightly higher chance (P = 0.07) of showing lower lesion severity (odds ratio 1.51) compared with tolerant CIEPP mink. The results suggested that tolerant mink had significantly reduced severity of AD lesions despite having anti-viral antibodies and carrying the virus. (C) 2017 The Authors.

16,The objective of this study was to assess the sensitivity of the Omni Klentaq-LA DNA polymerase for detecting Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV) in mink blood and tissues by PCR without DNA extraction. The presence of AMDV DNA was directly tested by Klentaq in the plasma. serum. whole blood. and spleen homogenates of 188 mink 4 and 16 months after inoculation with the virus. Samples from bone marrow. small intestine. liver. lungs. kidneys. and lymph nodes of 20 of the same mink were also tested by Klentaq. DNA was extracted from paired samples of plasma and the aforesaid tissues by a commercial nucleic acid extraction kit (Dynabeads Silane) and tested by PCR. Compared with the extracted DNA. Klentaq detected a significantly greater number of samples in the whole blood. serum. plasma. spleen. and small intestine. It was concluded that Klentaq is a preferred system for directly detecting AMDV DNA in mink blood and tissues. The lower success rate of extracted DNA compared with Klentaq could be the result of DNA losses during the extraction process. This is an important factor in chronically infected mink. which have a low AMDV copy number in the bloodstream. Direct AMDV detection also reduces the cost of PCR amplification and lowers the risk of sample contamination....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Headache
17,Background: Childhood adversities and emotional dysregulation are connected with chronic pain. alexithymia. and depression. Longitudinal studies exploring the impact of their co-occurrence on the pain situation are rare.Aims: The influence of alexithymia. depression. baseline pain situation. and treatment options on the course of chronic pain in a clinical sample was studied.Methods: The baseline data was collected from chronic pain patients (n=154) before their first pain clinic visit. and the follow-up data after 1 year by self-report questionnaires. Study variables consisted of pain intensity. pain disability. alexithymia (TAS-20). depression (BDI-II). and treatment interventions. Statistical analyses were performed to find out differences between baseline and follow-up. as well as between alexithymic and non-alexithymic patients. and to estimate the effect of the treatment provided.Results: At follow-up. the majority of the patients had pain intensity and disability severe enough to disrupt with their daily living. None of treatment interventions was related to better outcome. Alexithymic patients reported more pain disability and depression at both baseline and at follow-up. The effect of alexithymia on pain disability was mediated by depression. The use of opioids was connected to alexithymia and depressiveness. Alexithymia and depression made a substantial contribution to poorer outcome.Conclusions: Severe pain intensity and disability with depression and alexithymia predicted difficulties in achieving improvement. Depression and alexithymia probably impair compliance with treatment and adherence to interventions. Their co-occurrence with a more severe pain situation and with the use of opioids indicates psychological problems underlying the pain experience....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Depression
18,Background and objectives: Alexithymia is a multidimensional personality construct including the components difficulties identifying feelings (DIF). difficulties describing feelings (DDF). and externally oriented thinking (EOT). Different features of alexithymia are thought to reflect specific deficits in the cognitive processing and regulation of emotions. The aim of the present study was to examine for the first time patterns of deployment of attention as a function of alexithymia components in healthy persons by using eye-tracking technology. It was assumed that EOT is linked to avoidance of negative images. Methods: 99 healthy adults viewed freely pictures consisting of anxiety-related. depression-related. positive. and neutral images while gaze behavior was registered. Alexithymia was assessed by the 20 Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Measures of anxiety. depression. and (visual-perceptual) intelligence were also administered. Results: A main effect of emotion condition on dwell times was observed. Viewing time was lowest for neutral images. longer for depression-related and happy images. and longest for anxiety-related images. Gender and EOT had significant effects on dwell times. EOT correlated negatively with dwell time on depression-related (but not anxiety-related) images. There were no correlations of dwell times with depression. trait anxiety. intelligence. DIF. or DDF. Limitations: Alexithymia was assessed exclusively by self-report. Conclusions: Our results show that EOT but not DIF or DDF influences attention deployment to simultaneously presented emotional pictures. EOT may reduce attention allocation to dysphoric information. This attentional characteristic of EOT individuals might have mood protecting effects but also detrimental impacts on social relationships and coping competencies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

19,In legume plants. uricase gene (Nodulin-35) plays a positive role in metabolism of ureide and amide compounds in symbiotic nitrogen-fixing in the nodules. In this study. a pot experiment was performed to examine the effects of ammonium application on the transcription of MsU2 gene and distribution of major nitrogen compounds in alfalfa Medicago sativa. Data showed that alfalfa plant has a significant difference in contents of nitrogen compounds in xylem saps compared with soybean plant. and belongs to typical amide type legume plants with little ureide accumulation. and the accumulation of asparagines and ureide in the tissues of alfalfa is mainly gathered in the nodules. Northern blotting showed that excessive ammonium significantly inhibited the transcription of MsU2 gene in the nodules and roots. and mRNA accumulation of MsU2 gene in the plants exposed to excessive ammonium decreased gradually with culture time extension. indicating that application of ammonium significantly inhibited the transcription of MsU2 gene in the alfalfa plants. Although the application of excessive ammonium increased the contents of amino acids in various tissues of alfalfa. the accumulation of allantoin reflecting the strength of uricase activity is remarkably reduced in the xylem saps. stems and nodules when alfalfa plants exposed to excessive ammonium. suggesting that application of excessive ammonium generated a negative effect on symbiosis fixing-nitrogen system due to inhibition of ammonium ion on uricase activity in the nodules of alfalfa. This result seems to imply that application of excessive ammonium in legume plants should not be proposed to avoid affecting the ability of fixing nitrogen in the nodules of legume plants. and reasonable dose of ammonium should be recommended to effectively utilize the fixed N from atmosphere in legume plant production....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
20,The imminent depletion of fossil fuels and the surging global demand for renewable energy have led to the search for nonconventional energy sources. After a few decades of trial and error. the world is now testing the sources of the third generation of fossil fuels. which contain for most parts microalgae. With more than 80% oil content. being adaptable in growth parameters and highly versatile. microalgae are highly promising sources of biofuels in the present time. The present article makes a sweeping attempt to highlight the various methods employed for cultivation of microalgae. techniques to harvest and extract biomass from huge algal cultures. as well as their downstream production and processing procedures. The advantages. limitations. and challenges faced by each of them have been described to some extent. Major concerns pertaining to biofuels are supposed to be their environmental sustainability and economic viability along with their cost effectiveness. This would require a great deal of empirical data on existing systems and a great deal of optimization to generate a more robust one.

21,The natural variation of environmental factors in freshwater basins determines their biodiversity. Among them. calcium is a key physiological compound for freshwater invertebrates. It is required for shell formation. muscle contraction. it mediates gene expression and allows counteracting acidosis during stress periods. among other functions. Although the distribution of different freshwater species has been suggested to be linked with the environmental calcium concentration. as yet no research studies have confirmed this. Identifying whether environmental calcium concentrations might determine the invasion success of alien species would be critical in developing and implementing effective management strategies to control them. Here. a multidisciplinary approach integrating field surveys. analytical chemistry techniques. molecular biology analyses and a lab-scale experiment was taken to decipher whether the environmental calcium Concentration might hamper the establishment of Corbicula fluminea in northwestern Iberian rivers. A Principal Component Analysis on water chemistry variables from 13 water bodies identified environmental calcium concentration. among others. as one key factor that best characterized the distribution area of C. fluminea. The calcium content in animals' bodies from two representative rivers was dependent on the environmental calcium concentration of freshwater basins; the lower the concentration. the lower the body's content. The expression of stress- and calcium homeostasis-related genes was higher in C fluminea from low calcium concentration environments than in those from calcium-rich freshwater basins. Finally. under experimental conditions. lower water calcium concentrations decreased C fluminea growth rates. The present data suggest. for the first time. that environmental calcium concentration may act as a determinant factor on the invasion success of C. fluminea in freshwater environments. Our results provide new clues for the identification of basins with increased risk of potential invasion by C fluminea based on environmental calcium levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

22,Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP). also known as fabricated or induced illness in a child by a caretaker. is a form of abuse where a caregiver deliberately produces or feigns illness in a person under his or her care. so that the proxy will receive medical care that gratifies the caregiver. The affected children are often hospitalized for long periods and endure repetitive. painful and expensive diagnostic attempts. We present an analytically confirmed case of MSBP by alimemazine. A 3-year-old boy was brought repetitively to a Pediatric Emergency Department by his mother because he presented limb tremors. dysarthria. obnubilation. and ataxia and generalized tonic-clonic seizures coinciding with intermittent fever. Neither the rest of the physical examination nor the complementary tests showed any significant alterations. MSBP was suspected and a routine systematic toxicological analysis in urine and blood was requested. Alimemazine was detected in all biological samples. The administration of this drug was never mentioned by the mother and the subsequent interview with her corroborated the suspicion of MSBP. Clinically. after separation from the mother. the child's neurological symptoms gradually improved until the complete disappearance of the cerebellar symptoms. Alimemazine was quantified in serum. urine. gastric content and cerebrospinal fluid samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (maximum serum level was 0.42 mu g/ml). Hair quantification of alimemazine was performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in different segments of hair. The results confirmed regular substance use during the at least eight last months (8.8. 14.7. 19.7 and 4.6 ng/mg hair starting from most proximal segment). This patient represents the first case published with analytical data of alimemazine in blood. urine. gastric content. cerebrospinal fluid and hair. which allowed us to prove an acute and repetitive poisoning with alimemazine as evidence of MSBP.

23,Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a widely-tested. low-cost and rapid ancillary technique available in all laboratories of pathology. This method is generally used for diagnostic purposes. but several studies have investigated the sensitivity and specificity of different immunohistochemical anti-bodies as a surrogate test in the determination of predictive biomarkers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). particularly for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene mutations. Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene and ROS1 rearrangements. In this review. a critical examination of the works comparing the consistency of IHC expression and conventional molecular techniques to identify genetic alterations with predictive value in NSCLC is discussed. Summarizing. data on sensitivity and specificity of antibodies against ALK and ROS1 are very consistent and time has come to trust in IHC at least as a cost-effective screening tool to identify patients with rearranged tumors in clinical practice. On the other hand. mutant-specific antibodies against EGFR demonstrate a good specificity but a lowto- fair sensitivity. raising some cautions on their employment as robust predictive biomarkers. A brief comment on preliminary experiences with antibodies against BRAF. RET. HER2 and c-MET is also included....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
24,Allatostatins are important regulatory neuropeptides which are widely distributed in invertebrates and execute their functions through either neural or Immoral routes. However. the regulatory mechanism of the gene expression is unclear. In this paper. we report a naturally occurring amisense transcript. named as asMacro-AST A. of the crustacean FGLamide allatostatin gene (Macro-AST A) from the prawn. Macrobrachium rosenbergii. The asMacro-ASTA contains an 843-bp sequence fully complementary to the 3'end of the Macro-ASTA. To our knowledge. this is the first report of a natural antisense transcript in crustacean and the first endogenous antisense transcript of all identified allatostatin genes. Northern blotting analysis demonstrated that the gene was expressed in the thoracic ganglia where the sense gene was also expressed. Furthermore. we have detected a RNA-RNA duplex between the sense-antisense complementary region by using RNasc protection analysis and RT-PCR. These results suggest that the antisense gene may play a role in the regulation of Macro-AST A gene expression. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

25,Traditional digital controls mostly use digital-analog converters to convert input and output voltages into digital coding to achieve control. This paper proposes the use of two digital ramps with two different frequencies to replace a digital-analog converter. This approach can produce seven bit resolution for the DPMW signal. In addition. we use an all-digital DLL phase correction concept to further enhance the resolution of the DPWM signal by an additional three bits. resulting in 10-bit DPWM signal resolution. The proposed circuit uses 0.35 mu m CMOS processes. with a core area of 0.987 mm(2). a system switching frequency of 500 KHz. an input voltage range of 3.3-4.2 V. and an output voltage range of 5 V. Output voltage measurement accuracy reaches 99%. while the system reaches efficiency of 91% with output loads of up to 500 mA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

26,Background: Knockdown resistance (kdr). caused by alterations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (Na-v). is one of the mechanisms responsible for pyrethroid (PY) resistance. In the Asian tiger mosquito. Aedes albopictus. at least four different mutations were described in the IIIS6 Na-v segment in populations from Asia. North America and Europe. In contrast. in Aedes aegypti at least 12 non-synonymous mutations have been reported at nine different codons. mostly in the IIS6 and IIIS6 Na-v segments. The Phe1534Cys kdr mutation in the IIIS6 Na-v segment is the most prevalent in populations of Ae. aegypti worldwide. also found in Ae. albopictus from Singapore. Herein. we investigated the DNA diversity corresponding to the IIS6 and IIIS6 Na-v segments in natural populations of Ae. albopictus from Brazil. Methods: DNA from eight Brazilian Ae. albopictus natural populations were individually extracted and pooled by states of origin. amplified. cloned and sequenced for the corresponding IIS6 and IIIS6 Na-v segments. Additionally. samples from each location were individually genotyped by an allelic specific PCR (AS-PCR) approach to obtain the genotypic and allelic frequencies for the 1534 Na-v site. Results: No non-synonymous substitutions were observed in the IIS6 sequences. However. the Phe1534Cys kdr mutation was evidenced in the Ae. albopictus Na-v IIIS6 segment sequences from Parana (PR) and Rondonia (RO) states. but not from Mato Grosso (MT) state. The 1534Cys(kdr) allele varied from 3% (Marilena/PR and Porto Velho/RO) to 10% ( Foz do lguacu/ PR). To our knowledge. this paper reports the first occurrence and provides distribution data of a possible kdr mutation in Ae. albopictus in South America. Conclusion: The emergence of a likely kdr mutation in Ae. albopitus natural populations is a signal of alert for vector control measures since PY are the most popular insecticides adopted by residents. Additionally. once the kdr allele is present. its frequency tends to increase faster under exposition to those compounds. Although the Asian tiger mosquito is not incriminated as an important vector of dengue. chikungunya and Zika viruses in South America. its importance in this regard has been extensively discussed since Ae. albopictus is rapidly spreading and can also migrate between sylvatic and urban environments. Therefore. insecticide resistance monitoring initiatives should also be extended to Ae. albopictus in Brazil in order to maintain chemical compounds as an efficient vector control tool when needed....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,HIV/AIDS
27,Introduction: Some glial-neuronal tumors (GNT) (pleomorphic xantho-astrocytoma [PXA]. ganglioglioma [GG]) display BRAF-V600E mutation. which represents a diagnostic clue to these entities. Targeted therapies against BRAF-V600 protein have shown promising results in GNT. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of BRAF-V600E immunohistochemistry (IHC. clone VE1) in daily practice in a series of 140 glial. and GNT compared to molecular biology (MB) techniques. Methods: We performed BRAF-V600E IHC on all 140 cases. We used Sanger sequencing and allele-specific quantitative PCR (ASQ-PCR) to detect BRAF-V600E mutation when sufficient amount of materiel was available. Results: BRAF-V600E immunostaining was detected in 29.5% of cases (41/140 cases; 61.5% GG/GC/AGG (32/52). 33% PXA. 6.6% pilocytic astrocytomas). In 47 cases. MB could be performed: Sanger sequencing and ASQ-PCR in 34 cases. ASQ-PCR only in 11 cases. and Sanger sequencing only in two cases. In initial tumors. Sanger sequencing identified BRAF-V600E mutation in 19.5% tumors (seven of 36 tested cases). ASQ-PCR showed mutation in 48.5% tumors (17/35 tested cases). In six cases (5 GG. one PXA). the results were discordant between IHC and MB; the five GG cases were immunopositive for BRAF-V600E but wild type with both MB techniques. In another 7 GG. the percentage of mutated (ganglion) cells was low. and Sanger sequencing failed to detect the mutation. which was detected by IHC and ASQ-PCR. Conclusions: In tumors with few mutated cells (e.g.. GG). anti-BRAF-V600E IHC appears more sensitive than Sanger sequencing. The latter. although considered as the gold standard. is not to be used up-front to detect BRAF mutation in GG. The combination of IHC and ASQ-PCR appears more efficient to appraise the indication of targeted therapies in these glioneuronal tumors....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
28,BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether allergen immunotherapy (AIT) can be safely initiated during the pollen season (coseasonal initiation [CSI]) because of a potential increased risk of systemic allergic reactions. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review publications reporting the safety of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) CSI to validate or invalidate the perception of increased safety risk. METHODS: PubMed. EMBASE. Ovid. Literatura Latino Americana em Ciencias da Saude (LILACS). and Cochrane Library databases were searched without limits for studies of any design reporting SCIT or SLIT CSI for pollen allergen. Congress abstracts were included. RESULTS: Nineteen eligible studies were identified: 8 SCIT (n = 947 subjects total; n[340 double-blind placebo-controlled [DBPC]) and 11 SLIT (n = 2668 subjects total; n = 565 DBPC). Study characteristics and safety reporting were heterogeneous. No epinephrine administrations were reported. Discontinuation frequencies were 6% or less and 10% or less with SCIT and SLIT CSI. respectively. In SCIT studies. systemic allergic reaction frequency was 0% to 7% with "up to peak season" or CSI. 0% to 6% with "after peak season" or out-of-season initiation. and 0% to 7% with placebo. In SCIT studies. serious treatment-related adverse event (AE) frequency with CSI ranged from 0% to 2%; few severe AEs were reported. In SLIT studies. systemic allergic reaction frequency ranged from 0% to 4% with CSI. 0% with out-of-season initiation. and 0% to 2% with placebo. Overall. 2 serious treatment-related AEs with SLIT CSI were reported. Severe AE frequency in SLIT studies ranged from 0% to 8% with CSI. 0% to 12% with out-of-season initiation. and 0% to 8% with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: No increase in AEs of concern was observed with SCIT or SLIT CSI; however. additional data with standardized regimens and doses are needed. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy.

29,Allergic diseases often occur early in life and persist throughout life. This life-course perspective should be considered in allergen immunotherapy. In particular it is essential to understand whether this al treatment may be used in old age adults. The current paper was developed by a working group of AIRWAYS integrated care pathways for airways diseases. the model of chronic respiratory diseases of the European Innovation Partnership on active and healthy ageing (DG CONNECT and DG Sante). It considered (1) the political background. (2) the rationale for allergen immunotherapy across the life cycle.

(4) the strategic framework and the practical approach to synergize current initiatives in allergen immunotherapy. its mechanisms and the concept of active and healthy ageing....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
30,BackgroundClinical efficacy of pollen allergen immunotherapy (AIT) has been broadly documented in randomized controlled trials. The underlying clinical endpoints are analysed in seasonal time periods predefined based on the background pollen concentration. However. any validated or generally accepted definition from academia or regulatory authorities for this relevant pollen exposure intensity or period of time (season) is currently not available. Therefore. this Task Force initiative of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) aimed to propose definitions based on expert consensus. MethodsA Task Force of the Immunotherapy and Aerobiology and Pollution Interest Groups of the EAACI reviewed the literature on pollen exposure in the context of defining relevant time intervals for evaluation of efficacy in AIT trials. Underlying principles in measuring pollen exposure and associated methodological problems and limitations were considered to achieve a consensus. ResultsThe Task Force achieved a comprehensive position in defining pollen exposure times for different pollen types. Definitions are presented for pollen season'. high pollen season' (or peak pollen period') and high pollen days'. ConclusionThis EAACI position paper provides definitions of pollen exposures for different pollen types for use in AIT trials. Their validity as standards remains to be tested in future studies....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
31,There is no universally accepted grading system to classify the severity of systemic allergic reactions (SARs). including anaphylaxis. Although a consensus definition for anaphylaxis was established in 2005. the signs and symptoms required to define a reaction as anaphylaxis are inconsistently applied in research and clinical practice. As a result. it is difficult to compare and evaluate safety outcomes in surveys. clinical practice and trials. and pharmacovigilance data. In 2010. the World Allergy Organization (WAO) proposed a uniform grading system to classify allergen immunotherapy SARs. The basis of the grading system is the organ system(s) involved and reaction severity. The final grade is determined by the physician/health care professional after the event is over. Although the 2010 WAO grading system was developed to classify allergen immunotherapy SARs. with appropriate modifications. it can be used to classify SARs from any cause. The purpose of this Rostrum is to present a proposed modification of the 2010 WAO SAR grading system that will make it applicable to all SARs due to any cause. The modified grading system allows for classification of less severe SARs. which may be underreported or overreported in clinical trials and surveillance studies. depending on the criteria specified for adverse event reporting. The universal use of the proposed modified SAR grading system will allow for better safety comparisons across different venues and treatment protocols. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy.

32,Keratinocytes (KCs) play a key role in all phases of skin sensitization. We recently identified interleukin-18 (IL-18) production as useful end point for determination of contact sensitization potential of low molecular weight chemicals. The aim of this study was to identify genes involved in skin sensitizer-induced inflammasome activation and to establish their role in IL-18 production. For gene expression analysis. cells were treated for 6 h with p-phenylenediamine (PPD) as reference contact allergen; total RNA was extracted and examined with a commercially available Inflammasome Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) array. Among genes induced. NLRP12 (Nod-like receptor P12) was selected for further investigation. NLRP12 promoter region contains Blimp-1 (B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1)/PRDM1 binding site. and from the literature. it is reported that Blimp-1 reduces NLRP12 activity and expression in monocytes/macrophages. Their expression and role in KCs are currently unknown. To confirm NLRP12 expression and to investigate its relationship with Blimp-1. cells were exposed for different times (3. 6 and 24 h) to the extreme sensitizer 2.4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) and the strong sensitizer PPD. Allergens were able to induce both genes. however. with different kinetic. with DNCB more rapidly upregulating Blimp-1 and inducing IL-18 production. compared to PPD. NLRP12 and Blimp-1 expression appeared to be inversely correlated: Blimp-1 silencing resulted in increased NLRP12 expression and reduced contact allergen-induced IL-18 production. Overall results indicate that contact allergens of different potency differently modulate Blimp-1/NLRP12 expression. with strong allergen more rapidly downregulating NLRP12. thus more rapidly inducing IL-18 production. Data confirm that also in KCs. NLRP12 has an inhibitory effect on inflammasome activation assessed by IL-18 maturation....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Allergies
33,Background There is limited understanding of how maternal diet affects breastmilk food allergen concentrations. and whether exposure to allergens through this route influences the development of infant oral tolerance or sensitization. Objective To investigate how maternal dietary egg ingestion during early lactation influences egg protein (ovalbumin) levels detected in human breastmilk. Methods In a randomized controlled trial. women were allocated to a dietary group for the first six weeks of lactation: high-egg diet (>4 eggs per week). low-egg diet (one-three eggs per week) or an egg-free diet. Breastmilk samples were collected at 2. 4 and 6 weeks of lactation for the measurement of ovalbumin. The permeability of the mammary epithelium was assessed by measuring the breastmilk sodium : potassium ratio. Egg-specific IgE and IgG4 were measured in infant plasma at 6 weeks. and prior to the introduction of egg in solids at 16 weeks. Results Average maternal egg ingestion was associated with breastmilk ovalbumin concentration. Specifically. for each additional egg ingested per week. there was an average 25% increase in ovalbumin concentration (95% CI: 5-48%. P = 0.01). Breastmilk ovalbumin concentrations were significantly higher in the ` high-egg' group (>4 eggs per week) compared with the ` egg-free' group (P = 0.04). However. one-third of women had no breastmilk ovalbumin detected. No detectable associations were found between mammary epithelium permeability and breastmilk ovalbumin concentrations. Infant plasma egg-specific IgG4 levels were also positively associated with maternal egg ingestion. with an average 22% (95% CI: 3-45%) increase in infant egg-specific IgG4 levels per additional egg consumed per week (P = 0.02). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Increased maternal egg ingestion is associated with increased breastmilk ovalbumin. and markers of immune tolerance in infants. These results highlight the potential for maternal diet to benefit infant oral tolerance development during lactation....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
34,The ocular surface is constantly exposed to environmental irritants. allergens and pathogens. against which it can mount a prompt immune response to preserve its integrity. But to avoid unnecessary inflammation. the ocular surface's mucosal immune system must also discriminate between harmless and potentially dangerous antigens. a seemingly complicated task. Despite its unique features. the ocular surface is a mucosal lining. and as such. it shares some homeostatic and pathophysiological mechanisms with other mucosal surfaces. The purpose of this review is to explore the mucosal homeostatic immune function of the ocular surface in both the healthy and diseased states. with a special focus on mucosal immunology concepts.

35,Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common illness in children and can impair their quality of life. Furthermore. many children remain symptomatic despite maximizing systemic antihistamine and topical therapies. It is at this clinical juncture that immunotherapy may be considered. The efficacy and safety associated with both subcutaneous (SCIT) and sublingual (SLIT) approaches are reviewed and positioned as treatment options for pediatric patients. with specific focus on current literature as it relates to SLIT in children. including those with perennial allergic rhinitis. Although there is more extensive experience with SLIT treatment in Europe. grass and ragweed tablet forms of SLIT are approved in the US. Approaches to the care of pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis are presented. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy.

36,Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the most common chronic disease among children. To characterize the disease. a modified classification of severity (m-ARIA) has recently been validated in AR children. When medical treatment fails. surgery for nasal obstructive disorders (NOD) may be a therapeutic option. Our objective was to assess the prevalence of NOD and their influence in medical treatment response among children with persistent AR (PER). Methods: In a prospective. real-life study. 130 paediatric PER patients (13.1 +/- 2.8years. females 31.5%. severe rhinitis 49%) referred from Allergy to ENT department were assessed for their response (R. responders; NR. non-responders) to medical treatment (intranasal steroids and antihistamines or antileukotrienes) by direct questioning and nasal symptom visual analogue scale. the presence of NOD (septal deformity. turbinate enlargement and adenoidal hyperplasia). comorbidities. nasal symptoms. rhinitis severity (modified ARIA criterion) and asthma control (International Consensus On Pediatric Asthma criterion). Results: After 2months of treatment. the NR group presented a higher prevalence of obstructive septal deformity and severe inferior turbinate enlargement when compared with the R group. Higher septal deformity and turbinate enlargement scores were strongly associated with treatment refractoriness. The prevalence of severe PER was also higher for the NR group. Higher asthma control scores were associated with the probability of treatment-induced improvement. Conclusions: In paediatric PER patients. medical therapy refractoriness was associated with NOD. mainly septal deformity and turbinate enlargement. In those patients. ENT examination will facilitate an early NOD diagnosis in order to indicate potential corrective surgery....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
37,Background Over the past decade. regulatory bodies and scientific societies recommended. as primary efficacy outcome. a score that reflects both symptom severity and use of rescue medication for clinical trials in allergy immunotherapy (AIT). Objective We sought to compare the results obtained with two subject-specific scores. the Combined Score (CS) and the Adjusted Symptom Score (AdSS). for assessment of AIT in seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis due to birch and grass pollen allergens. Methods CS and AdSS were evaluated in subjects receiving a 300IR dose of allergen extract daily. by sublingual route. in four clinical trials with the 5-grass pollen tablet (NCT00367640. NCT00409409. NCT00955825 and NCT00418379) and one with the birch pollen solution (NCT01731249). The CS is derived from the Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Score (RTSS) and the Rescue Medication Score (RMS) giving equal weight to symptoms and medication use. The AdSS is a symptom score adjusting for rescue medication use. Efficacy end-points were analysed using an analysis of covariance linear model. Results In all trials. despite the different constructs of the two scores. Combined Score or Adjusted Symptom Score were similarly reduced in the 300IR group compared to the placebo group. Treatment effect was consistently demonstrated with both scores. CS and AdSS. used as either daily scores or average of the daily scores over the pollen season. Minor differences with the same statistical conclusions were observed between the results. leading to the same interpretation. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance The two scores. combined and adjusted scores. for evaluation of clinical efficacy of AIT have led to similar results. with similar statistical conclusions and similar interpretation....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
38,Background: Limited accessibility to providers may delay appropriate control of asthma exacerbations. The objective of our study is to estimate the contributors to the hospital/emergency department (ED) visits among adults with asthma focusing on the availability of healthcare providers. Methods: We conducted a pooled cross-sectional analysis using the 2011-2013 Asthma Call-Back Survey linked with 2012-2016 Area Health Resource Files. We employed multivariable logistic regression with dichotomous outcomes of hospitalization and ED visits. Key covariates were the availability of county-level healthcare provider variables per 100.000 persons such as the number of lung disease specialists (including pulmonary care specialists. and allergy and immunology specialists). the number of hospitals. the number of safety-net facilities including rural health centers (RHCs) and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). and the number of primary care physicians (PCPs). Results: Among 25.621 adults. proportions of hospital visits and ED visits were 3.3% and 13.2%. respectively. An additional RHC reduced by 3% the odds of having an ED visit (odds ratio [OR] = 0.97. p=.004). Patients with cost barriers to seeing a PCP were 60% (OR = 1.60. p=.028) more likely to have a hospital visit than those without. In addition. patients with cost barriers to seeing a specialist were 90% (OR = 1.90. p=.007) and 111% (OR =2.11. p=.001) more likely to have a hospital visit and ED visit. respectively. than those without. Conclusions: Hospital and ED visits among adults with asthma are partially related to the availability of providers. and more related to financial barriers. Therefore. financial support for the vulnerable asthma population might be a target for policy makers interested in reducing hospitalizations and ED visits....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Mental Health
39,Background: Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) capsule enables evasion from phagocytosis. invasion of keratinocytes. and bacterial survival. In mixed infection. the capsule also participates in coaggregation. which may lead to characteristic virulence not present in the monoinfection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of Pg capsule as a virulence factor in coaggregated mixed infection with Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn). Methods: Mixed infections containing Fn and non-capsulated or capsulated strains of Pg were compared with the same infection with lactose as coaggregation inhibitor. Murine experimental periodontitis was used to assess disease severity. Primary polymorphonuclear leukocytes and keratinocytes were used to examine phagocytosis and bacterial invasion. respectively. Results: Mixed infection with capsulated Pg augmented alveolar bone loss compared with that of mixed infection with non-capsulated Pg. Addition of lactose led to attenuation of bone loss in the capsulated mixed infection and to intensification of bone loss in the non-capsulated mixed infection. In the latter mixed infection. Fn evaded phagocytosis. whereas in the capsulated mixed infection Pg displayed a greater capacity for invasion of keratinocytes. Conclusions: Pg capsule was found to serve as a unique virulence factor in mixed infection with Fn. Capsule-dependent coaggregation led to augmented invasion of Pg and may be responsible for the severity of disease after mixed infection with Fn....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Fungal Infection
40,Background: Leukotoxin (Ltx) expressed by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a powerful exotoxin. which can cause imbalance in host response. Immunoreactivity to Ltx is a marker for presence of leukotoxic A. actinomycetemcomitans. a presence that may modify the disease pattern of colonized individuals. The aim of the present study is to examine presence of systemic immunoreactivity to A. actionmycetemcomitans Ltx with respect to clinical and inflammatory findings in individuals with or without periodontitis (N = 88). Methods: Periodontal status was examined in patients with severe periodontitis (n = 49) and healthy controls (n = 39). and patients received periodontal treatment. Systemic biomarkers associated with inflammation and infections as well as clinical parameters were analyzed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after treatment. Results: Presence of immunoreactivity against Ltx was associated with impaired remission of disease after periodontal treatment. This immunoreactivity was also significantly associated with increased systemic levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans-specific immunoglobulins and increasing age. Conclusion: Presence and levels of systemic immunoreactivity against A. actinomycetemcomitans Ltx are associated with decreased remission after otherwise successful periodontal treatment....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Ankylosing Spondylitis
41,Among athletes and coaches. there is a common perception that high training loads and competitions. applied chronically. with inadequate nutritional control and/or recovery periods. may reduce the immune resistance. increasing susceptibility to infection episodes. mainly upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). In this sense. this study is focused on reviewing the interactions between immunological parameters with the overtraining syndrome. specifically in team sports. considering its intermittent nature. Thus. a review of national and international journals related to the topic was held. The correlations between exercise. immune system and susceptibility to URTI have been evaluated mainly in individual and endurance sports compared to the team sports. The modulations of leukocytes throughout the season. against the totalization of training loads and competitions. when analyzed specifically for neutrophils and monocytes. are possibly related to tissue repair processes and incidence of URTI. Modulations related to lymphocytes seem to be more directly related to the incidence of URTI. Moreover. an understanding of all the proposed markers. including immunological markers. in association with the performance indicators and control of training. appears to be a more promising avenue for clinical diagnosis of the athlete's immune status and prevention of overtraining syndrome than the search for a unique marker of overtraining....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Sports Injuries
42,Background Adrenaline auto-injectors (AAI) should be provided to individuals considered to be at high risk of anaphylaxis. There is some evidence that the rate of AAI prescription is increasing. but the true extent has not been previously quantified. Aim To estimate the trends in annual GP-issued prescriptions for AAI among UK children between 2000 and 2012. Design and setting Retrospective cohort study using data from primary care practices that contributed to The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. Method Children and young people aged between 0-17 years of age with a prescription for AAIs were identified. and annual AAI device prescription rates were estimated using Stata (version 12). Results A total of 1.06 million UK children were identified. providing 5.1 million person years of follow-up data. Overall. 23 837 children were deemed high risk by their GPs. and were prescribed 98 737 AAI devices. This equates to 4.67 children (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.66 to 4.69). and 19.4 (95% CI = 19.2 to 19.5) devices per 1000 person years. Between 2000 and 2012. there has been a 355% increase in the number of children prescribed devices. and a 506% increase in the total number of AAI devices prescribed per 1000 person years in the UK. The number of devices issued per high-risk child during this period has also increased by 33%. Conclusion The number of children being prescribed AAI devices and the number of devices being prescribed in UK primary care between 2000 and 2012 has significantly increased. A discussion to promote rational prescribing of AAIs in the NHS is needed....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
43,Background: The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) is in the process of developing the EAACI Guidelines on Allergen Immunotherapy (AIT) for the management of insect venom allergy. To inform this process. we sought to assess the effectiveness. cost-effectiveness and safety of AIT in the management of insect venom allergy. Methods: We undertook a systematic review. which involved searching 15 international biomedical databases for published and unpublished evidence. Studies were independently screened and critically appraised using established instruments. Data were descriptively summarized and. where possible. meta-analysed. Results: Our searches identified a total of 16 950 potentially eligible studies; of which. 17 satisfied our inclusion criteria. The available evidence was limited both in volume and in quality. but suggested that venom immunotherapy (VIT) could substantially reduce the risk of subsequent severe systemic sting reactions (OR = 0.08. 95% CI 0.03-0.26); meta-analysis showed that it also improved disease-specific quality of life (risk difference = 1.41. 95% CI 1.04-1.79). Adverse effects were experienced in both the build-up and maintenance phases. but most were mild with no fatalities being reported. The very limited evidence found on modelling cost-effectiveness suggested that VIT was likely to be cost-effective in those at high risk of repeated systemic sting reactions and/or impaired quality of life. Conclusions: The limited available evidence suggested that VIT is effective in reducing severe subsequent systemic sting reactions and in improving disease-specific quality of life. VIT proved to be safe and no fatalities were recorded in the studies included in this review. The cost-effectiveness of VIT needs to be established....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
44,During the last two decades. hyper-immunoglobulin (Ig) E syndromes have been characterized clinically and molecularly in patients with genetically determined primary immunodeficiencies. However. the detection of low IgE levels. defined here as below detection limit in the routine clinical immunology laboratory. has received little attention. We analysed the association of serum IgA. IgM and IgG levels (including IgG subclasses) with low. normal or high serum IgE levels in patients evaluated in a singlecentre out-patient immunodeficiency and allergy clinic. The correlation of serum IgE levels with IgG subclasses depended on the clinical phenotype. In patients with immunodeficiencies. IgE correlated with IgG2 and IgG4 but not with IgG3. In contrast. in patients referred for signs of allergy. IgE correlated with IgG3 but not with IgG2. A low IgE result was associated with low IgG3 and IgG4 in allergy referrals. while immunodeficiency referrals with a low IgE result had significantly lower IgG1. IgG2 and IgG4 levels. Hierarchical clustering of non-IgE immunoglobulin profiles (IgM. IgA. IgG. IgG1-4) validated that non-IgE immunoglobulin levels predict the clinic referral. i.e. phenotype. of low-IgE patients. These results suggesto guide the clinical management of patients with low serum IgE levels....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
45,Purpose of review Although chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. asthma. and allergy share common inflammatory mechanisms. there is no evidence of cause-and-effect relationship. In this review. we present new studies investigating the complex immunology that links these diseases. Advances in new therapies as well as evidence regarding indication and timing of surgery. especially of more complex cases. are highlighted. Recent findings New studies have endotyped patients in an effort to describe the exact inflammatory profile of each phenotype. whereas described cytokines seem to play a significant role in amplification of T2 inflammation. directly or via innate lymphoid cells. New mAbs that block specific cytokines of these pathways have been developed and seem to show reduced asthma severity as well as improved sinonasal outcomes. Moreover. it has been shown that operating early in the course of disease leads not only to bigger improvements in SNOT-22 outcomes but also to reduced asthma incidence postoperatively in refractory cases. Summary Applying data from current studies in clinical practice. we could better manage refractory cases with asthma and polyps. both medically and surgically. Treatment has to be patient-centered. and this demands a multidisciplinary-team approach of the airway diseases....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Alzheimer's Disease
46,BACKGROUND: The difference in clinical presentation. causality assessments. and outcomes of patients with delayed antibiotic-associated cutaneous adverse drug reactions (AA-cADR) and nonantibiotic-associated (NA)-cADR is ill defined. OBJECTIVE: We examined the etiology of AA-cADR. with regard to the type of antibiotic exposure. allergy labeling. and patient outcomes. in comparison with NA-cADR. METHODS: A retrospective observational inpatient cohort study of cADR was performed from January 2004 to August 2014. Patients were divided into AA-cADR and NA-cADR groups for analysis. cADR was defined as erythema multiforme. fixed drug eruption. acute generalized erythematous pustulosis. drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). drug-associated linear IgA disease. Stevens-Johnson syndrome. and toxic epidermal necrolysis. RESULTS: Of the 84 patients with cADR. 48% were AA-cADR. Male sex (60% vs 32%. P = .004). median length of stay (14.5 vs 11 days. P = .05). median Charlson comorbidity index (3 vs 1. P = .03). and inpatient mortality (20% vs 5%. P = .04) were higher in AA-cADR compared with NA-cADR. The median drug latency was lower in AA-cADR (6 vs 20 days. P = .001). Sulfonamide antibiotics and glycopeptides were implicated in 20% of AA-cADR. DRESS was more frequently reported in AA-cADR. After cADR diagnosis. further antibiotic therapy was administered in 64% of patients. higher in AA-cADR (75%. 30 of 40) compared with NA-cADR (55%. 24 of 44) (P = .06). Fluoroquinolones (53% vs 21%. P = .02). glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin; 70% vs 38%. P = .05). and carbapenems (33% vs 13%. P = .11) were used more commonly in AA-cADR. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics were the cause of cADR requiring hospital admission in 48% of episodes. and were associated with longer length of stay. higher age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index. shorter drug latency. and mortality. In AA-cADR. glycopeptide and sulfonamide antibiotic exposure predominated. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy. Asthma & Immunology...,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
47,A recreational scuba diver wore a second scuba regulator against his face during a scuba dive. attached by an elastic rubber cord necklace. After surfacing. the diver's left face became swollen. Through a process of elimination all other items of scuba equipment were excluded as potential causes. A dive with the same equipment minus the necklace confirmed the involvement of the necklace in the pathogenesis of the hypersensitive reaction. In vitro ImmunoCap IgE assay was positive to latex (1.30 kUa/L). subsequent patch testing for contact dermatitis provoked a reaction for benzophenone-4. (a UV stabalizer) and Fourier Transform Infra Red spectroscopy identified the elastic as ethylene propylene rubber. containing additional unidentified compounds. Allergy to natural rubber latex occurs in as many as 6% of Americans and Australians. Around three million American residents are thought to scuba dive each year.

48,Allogenic lymphocyte immunotherapy (LIT) as a treatment for unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA) is still controversial due to the lack of enough controls to evaluate its effectiveness. Eighteen randomized. placebo-controlled trials with LIT for URSA were included in the meta-analysis. Live birth rates for each group were extracted. and the overall odds ratio (OR) for LIT was calculated. The success rate of treatment group was significantly higher (OR 3.74. 95% CI 3.07 similar to 4.57). LIT performed before and during pregnancy had dramatically improved the live birth rate in women with URSA (OR 4.67. 95% CI 3.70 similar to 5.90). The overall OR was 5.25 (95% CI 4.16 similar to 6.64). which supports a low dose of lymphocytes for treating URSA. Our results indicate that LIT provides a significantly beneficial effect over placebo for URSA. LIT given before and during pregnancy is superior to LIT given only before pregnancy. and the lower doses per treatment (less than 100 x 10(6) lymphocytes or 100 mL peripheral blood) achieved a better outcome....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Rheumatoid Arthritis

50,Alloparenting. defined as care provided by individuals other than parents. is a universal behavior among humans that has shaped our evolutionary history and remains important in contemporary society. Dysfunctions in alloparenting can have serious and sometimes fatal consequences for vulnerable infants and children. In spite of the importance of alloparenting. they still have much to learn regarding the underlying neurobiological systems governing its expression. Here. they review how a lack of alloparental behavior among traditional laboratory species has led to a blind spot in our understanding of this critical facet of human social behavior and the relevant neurobiology. Based on what is known. they draw from model systems ranging from voles to meerkats to primates to describe a conserved set of neuroendocrine mechanisms supporting the expression of alloparental care. In this review we describe the neurobiological and behavioral prerequisites. ontogeny. and consequences of alloparental care. Lastly. they identified several outstanding topics in the area of alloparental care that deserve further research efforts to better advance human health and wellbeing. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals.

51,Objective: Anxiety and mood disorders (AMD) are the most frequent mental disorders in the human population. They have recently shown increasing prevalence. and commonly disrupt personal and working lives. Objective: The aim of our study was to analyze the spectrum of circulating steroids in order to discover differences that could potentially be markers of affective depression or anxiety. and identify which steroids could be a predictive component for these diseases. Methods: We studied the steroid metabolome including 47 analytes in 20 men with depression (group D). 20 men with anxiety (group AN) and 30 healthy controls. OPLS and multivariate regression models were used for statistical analysis. Results: Discrimination of group D from controls by the OPLS method was absolute. as was group AN from controls (sensitivity = 1.000 (0.839. 1.000). specificity = 1.000 (0.887. 1.000)). Relatively good predictivity was also found for discrimination between group D from AN (sensitivity = 0.850 (0.640. 0.948). specificity = 0.900 (0.699. 0.972)). Conclusion: Selected circulating steroids. including those that are neuroactive and neuroprotective. can be useful tools for discriminating between these affective diseases in adult men.

52,Neurosteroids are essential for aiding proper fetal neurodevelopment. Pregnancy compromises such as preterm birth. prenatal stress and intrauterine growth restriction are associated with an increased risk of developing behavioural and mood disorders. particularly during adolescence. These pathologies involve the premature loss or alteration of trophic steroid hormones reaching the fetus leading to impaired neurodevelopment. While the specific programming mechanisms are yet to be fully elucidated. in adult life. dysfunctions of allopregnanolone action are prevalent in individuals with depression. post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders. The objective of this study was to assess if changes in concentrations of the neurosteroid. allopregnanolone. may be a fetal programming factor in priming the brain towards a negative behavioural phenotype during the childhood to adolescent period using a guinea pig model. Pregnant guinea pigs received either vehicle (45% (2-hydroxypropyI)-beta-cyclodextrin) or the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor. finasteride (25 mg/kg maternal weight) from gestational age 60 until spontaneous delivery (similar to 71 days gestation). Male and female offspring from vehicle and finasteride treated dams were tested at postnatal day 20 (juvenile-equivalence) in an open field arena. and hippocampus and amygdala subsequently assessed for neurological changes in markers of development and GABA production pathways 24 h later. Females with reduced allopregnanolone exposure in utero displayed increased neophobic-like responses to a change in their environment compared to female controls. There were no differences in the neurodevelopmental markers assessed; MAP2. NeuN. MBP. GFAP or GAD67 between intrauterine finasteride or vehicle exposure. in either the hippocampus or amygdala whereas GAT1 staining was decreased. This study indicates that an intrauterine reduction in the supply of allopregnanolone programs vulnerability of female offspring to anxiety-like disorders in juvenility without impacting long term allopregnanolone concentrations.

53,High-temperature requirement A (HtrA; DegP) from Escherichia coli. an important element of the extracytoplasmic protein quality-control system. is a member of the evolutionarily conserved family of serine proteases. The characteristic feature of this protein is its allosteric mode of activation. The regulatory loops. L3. L2. L1 and LD. play a crucial role in the transmission of the allosteric signal. Yet. the role of LD has not been fully elucidated. Therefore. we undertook a study to explain the role of the individual LD residues in inducing and maintaining the proteolytic activity of HtrA. We investigated the influence of amino acid substitutions located within the LD loop on the kinetics of a model substrate cleavage as well as on the dynamics of the oligomeric structure of HtrA. We found that the mutations that were expected to disturb the loop's structure and/or interactions with the remaining regulatory loops severely diminished the proteolytic activity of HtrA. The opposite effect. that is. increased activity. was observed for G174S substitution. which was predicted to strengthen the interactions mediated by LD. HtrAG174S protein had an equilibrium shifted toward the active enzyme and formed preferentially high-order oligomeric forms....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Enzymology

55,In this paper. a new Voltage-Mode (VM) first-order All-Pass Filter (APF) topology composed of only a grounded capacitor is proposed. The proposed APF uses a single. minus-type. second-generation. current conveyor (CCII-). which can be constructed by only five MOS transistors. It has low power consumption. The resonance frequency of the proposed APF can be adjusted by changing only a resistor value. However. it needs a single matching condition. As an application. a quadrature oscillator example is given. A non-ideality analysis for the proposed APF is also given. A number of time domain and frequency domain simulation results and an experimental test result are included to confirm the theory. (C) 2015 Sharif University of Technology.

56,The transcription factor encoded by the gene Knotted1 is a nuclear homeodomain protein. regulating meristematic cells at the shoot apical meristem. It has been demonstrated that Knotted1 (KN1) expression specifies stem cell fate in adventitious shoot induction in herbaceous plants. This gene may thus potentially identify the initiation of meristem development in adventitious shoot induction in difficult-to-regenerate plants such as Prunoideae. We isolated an almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.) KN1-type gene using degenerate primers targeting the most conserved regions of Knotted1 gene. The 5' and 3' ends of the isolated sequence were obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR). and the gene was named P. dulcis Knotted1-like (PdKn1). PdKn1 transcripts were detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR mainly in shoot apical and axillary meristems. The RT-PCR and RT-quantitative PCR PdKn1 expression in almond leaf explants was found to anticipate the organization of adventitious shoot meristems. Apricot RNA isolated from induced leaf explants cross-hybridized with the almond probe PdKn1 in Northern blotting. We suggest that almond PdKn1 may be a useful marker to study the adventitious regeneration system by revealing the potential organogenic conditions. not only in almond but also in other Prunoideae....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
57,Laminin (Lm) alpha 4 chain. a constituent of Lm-411 and Lm-421. is mainly localized to mesenchyme-derived tissues. and is suggested to have a role in formation and function of endothelium. transmigration of inflammatory cells through endothelium. and invasion of certain tumors. In this study. we evaluated the distribution of alpha 4 chain Lms in 33 conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) (31 primary tumors. two metastases). two papillary RCCs. and two oncocytomas by immunohistochemistry. In all tumors. immunoreactivity for Lm alpha 4 chain was found in vasculature and stroma. Basement membranes were detected around tumor cell islets in 34/37 tumors. They showed immunoreactivity for Lm alpha 4 chain in 28/34 cases. Northern blotting. inhibition of protein secretion with monensin. and immunoprecipitation combined with Western blotting showed that Caki-2. ACHN. and Caki-1 renal carcinoma cell lines produce alpha 4 chain Lms. In cell adhesion assay. recombinant human Lm-411 did not promote adhesion of renal carcinoma cells but inhibited adhesion to fibronectin (Fn). In cell migration assay. the cells migrated more on Lm-411 than on Fn. The results suggest that alpha 4 chain Lms have a de- adhesive function and could thus play a role in detachment. migration and invasion of renal carcinoma cells in vivo....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Cancer
58,The AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 is downregulated in neurons following a wide range of neurological insults. Here we report that suppression of GluR2 gene promoter activity is associated with kainate (KA)-induced downregulation of GluR2 subunit levels in primary cultured cortical neurons. RT-PCR and Northern blotting showed a significant decrease in GluR2 mRNA in cultured neurons after KA exposure. Transfection of cultured neurons with an expression vector pGL3-GluR2(-298/+283). where the reporter gene firefly luciferase was driven by the GluR2 promoter. revealed that KA exposure suppressed the transcriptional activation of the GluR2 promoter. Furthermore. the expression of the RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) was increased in KA-exposed cortical neurons; enhanced binding of REST to RE1-like silencer element in the proximal promoter of the GluR2 subunit gene was evidenced by electrophoresis mobility shift assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that suppressed activity of the GluR2 promoter in cultured neurons after KA exposure was related to deacetylation of histone H4. These results indicate that REST as a crucial factor binds to RE1-like silencer element in the GluR2 promoter. suppressing transcription of the GluR2 subunit gene during KA exposure. Our data suggest that transcriptional suppression of the G1uR2 subunit gene may contribute at least in part to downregulation of GluR2 subunit protein in neurons during KA exposure. Because our experiments showed a reduction of glutamate release in KA-exposed cortical neurons. REST may play a latent role in delayed neuronal death or in seizure-induced tolerance.

59,alpha-Glucans are present in virtually all domains of life. and these glucose chains linked by alpha-1.4- and alpha-1.6-linked branches form the most important storage carbohydrates in cells. It is likely for this reason that alpha-glucans are not generally considered as bioactive molecules as beta-glucans are. Nevertheless. it is known that depending on their source. many alpha-glucans play important roles as modulators of immune response. Recent efforts have attempted to elucidate the mechanisms through which alpha-glucans exert their immunostimulant effects; however. the main challenge is the accurate identification of the receptors of immune cells involved in their recognition. Here. we review the adjuvant properties reported for some polysaccharides and ultimately focus on alpha-glucans and how their structural characteristics. such as molecular weight. solubility and derivatization. influence their immunostimulatory properties. As a final point. we discuss the potential and associated challenges of using these polysaccharides as adjuvants. particularly in mucosal vaccination. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

60,Changes in the gastrointestinal microbial community are frequently associated with chronic diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. However. understanding the relationship of any individual taxon within the community to host physiology is made complex due to the diversity and individuality of the gut microbiota. Defined microbial communities such as the Altered Schaedler Flora (ASF) help alleviate the challenges of a diverse microbiota by allowing one to interrogate the relationship between individual bacterial species and host responses. An important aspect of studying these relationships with defined microbial communities is the ability to measure the population abundance and dynamics of each member. Herein. we describe the development of an improved ASF species-specific and sensitive real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for use with SYBR Green chemistry to accurately assess individual ASF member abundance. This approach targets hypervariable regions V1 through V3 of the 16S rRNA gene of each ASF taxon to enhance assay specificity. We demonstrate the reproducibility. sensitivity and application of this new method by quantifying each ASF bacterium in two inbred mouse lines. We also used it to assess changes in ASF member abundance before and after acute antibiotic perturbation of the community as well as in mice fed two different diets. Additionally. we describe a nested PCR assay for the detection of lowly abundant ASF members. Altogether. this improved qPCR method will facilitate gnotobiotic research involving the ASF community by allowing for reproducible quantification of its members under various physiological conditions.

61,Because of their prominent roles in regulation of gene expression. it is important to understand how levels of Krupple-like transcription factors SP1 and SP3 change in germ cells during spermatogenesis. Using immunological techniques. we found that both factors decreased sharply during meiosis. SP3 declined during the leptotene-to-pachytene transition. whereas SP1 fell somewhat later. as spermatocytes progressed beyond the early pachytene stage. SP3 reappeared for a period in round spermatids. For Sp1. the transition to the pachytene stage is accompanied by loss of the normal. 8.2-kb mRNA and appearance of a prevalent. 8.8-kb variant. which has not been well characterized. We have now shown that this pachytene-specific transcript contains a long. unspliced sequence from the first intron and that this sequence inhibits expression of a reporter. probably because of its many short open-reading frames. A second testis-specific Sp1 transcript in spermatids of 2.4 kb also has been reported previously. Like the 8.8-kb variant. it is compromised translationally. We have confirmed by Northern blotting that the 8.8-. 8.2-. and 2.4-kb variants account for the major testis Sp1 transcripts. Thus. the unexpected decline of SP1 protein in the face of continuing Sp1 transcription is explained. in large part. by poor translation of both novel testis transcripts. As part of this work. we also identified five additional. minor SpI cap sites by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. including a trans-spliced RNA originating from the Glcci1 gene....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
62,Modern drives consist of alternating current electric motors. and the field-oriented control (FOC) of such motors enables fast. precise. and robust regulation of a drive's mechanical variables such as torque. speed. and position. The control algorithm. implemented in a microprocessor. requires feedback from motor currents. and the quality of this feedback is essential to a drive's control properties. Motor phase currents are sampled and processed in order to extract their mean over a digital control interval. Afterwards. the mean phase currents are transformed into a rotating field-oriented reference frame to enable controlling the mechanical variables. The field-oriented frame rotates continuously. but in practice the transformation is carried out using a discrete angular position. This paper investigates how the discretization impacts the computed field-oriented currents in high speed drives. where the rotor displacement during a control interval is substantial. A continuous-time model of field-oriented currents is indicated as a reference to quantify errors. An original approach to normalize variables and to solve the model analytically is proposed in order to investigate how the errors related to rotor position discretization are influenced by drive operating conditions. The analytical solution is validated by computer simulation. The results show that the currently applied methodology of computing field-oriented current components. due to an invalid assumption. introduces errors of a few percent when a drive operates at high speed. These errors can be compensated using the presented solution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Control engineering
63,This article draws upon recent geographical work on assemblage to reconsider how we understand alternative food economies. In particular it brings attention to the devices upon which these economies relyspecifically plastics. Since the mid-twentieth century. plastics have developed close and complex relations with our agrifood systems; they facilitate commodity valuation and product circulation worldwide but are also recognised as problematic due to their environmental and human health impacts. Despite this paradox and the attention plastics increasingly receive. we know little of their relations with alternative food initiatives (AFIs). How do plastics inhabit alternative food economies? What associations and circulations become performed? What do these markets look like from a device-oriented perspective? To address these questions. the paper draws on fieldwork undertaken in Brisbane (Australia) with two AFIsa weekly organic market and an online box program/wholesaler. Using visualisation and an assemblage approach discloses the presences. flows. functions. and tensions of plastics in AFIs. In this way. plastics are revealed but also act to reveal alternative food economies. This analysis steps away from evaluations of AFIs' (in)effective challenge to neoliberalisation to consider them as complex. processual. sometimes ambivalent efforts that not only distribute good food' but engage in important ways with things like plastics....,Psychology,MAE,Attention,Hydraulics
64,Background: We developed and validated a kinetic microplate hemolytic assay (HA) to quantify classical and alternative complement activity in a single dilution of human plasma or serum. Methods: The assay is based on monitoring hemolysis of sensitized sheep (or uncoated rabbit) red blood cells by means of a 96-well microplate reader. The activity of the calibrator was evaluated by reference to 200 healthy adults. The conversion of 50% hemolysis time into a percentage of activity was obtained using a calibration curve plotted daily. Results: The linearity of the assay as well as interference (by hemolysis. bilrubinemia and lipemia) was assessed for classical pathway (CP). The within-day and the between-day precision was satisfactory regarding the performance of commercially available liposome immunoassay (LIA) and ELISA. Patients with hereditary or acquired complement deficiencies were detected (activity was measured <30%). We also provided a reference range obtained from 200 blood donors. The agreement of CP evaluated on samples from 48 patients was 94% with LIA and 87.5% with ELISA. The sensitivity of our assay was better than that of LIA. and the cost was lower than either LIA or ELISA. In addition. this assay was less time consuming than previously reported HAs. Conclusions: This assay allows the simultaneous measurement of 36 samples in duplicate per run of a 96-well plate. The use of a daily calibration curve allows standardization of the method and leads to good reproducibility. The same technique was also adapted for the quantification of alternative pathway (AP) activity....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Hereditary Angioedema
65,NO-mediated alternative pathway plays an important role in protecting wheat seedlings against drought stress through dissipating excessive reducing equivalents generated by photosynthesis. Alternative pathway (AP) has been proven to be involved in responses to various stresses. However. the mechanisms of AP in defense response to drought stress are still lacking. The aims of this work are to investigate the role of AP in drought tolerance and how AP is induced under drought stress using two wheat cultivars with different drought tolerance. Our results showed that Longchun22 cultivar is more tolerant to drought than 98SN146 cultivar. Seedlings exposed to drought led to a significant increase in AP. and it increased more in Longchun22. Furthermore. chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (Fv/Fm. I broken vertical bar PSII. qP) decreased significantly in drought-treated seedlings. especially in 98SN146. indicating that photoinhibition occurred under drought stress. Pretreatment with SHAM. the malate-oxaloacetate shuttle activity and photosynthetic efficiency were further inhibited in drought-treated seedlings. resulting in more serious oxidative damage as indicated by higher levels of malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide. Moreover. NO modulated AP under drought stress by increasing AOX1a expression and pyruvate content. Taken together. these results indicate that NO-mediated AP is involved in optimizing photosynthesis under drought stress by avoiding the over-reduction of photosynthetic electron transport chain. thus reducing reactive oxygen species production and oxidative damage in wheat leaves....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Immunology
66,A hallmark of male germ cell gene expression is the generation by alternative polyadenylation of cell-specific mRNAs. many of which utilize noncanonical A(A/U)UAAA-independent polyadenylation signals. Cleavage factor I (CFlm). a component of the pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation protein complex. can direct A(A/U)UAAA-independent polyadenylation site selection of somatic cell mRNAs. Here we report that the CFlm subunits NUDT21/CPSF5 and CPSF6 are highly enriched in mouse male germ cells relative to somatic cells. Both subunits are expressed from spermatogenic cell mRNAs that are shorter than the corresponding somatic transcripts. Complementary DNA sequencing and Northern blotting revealed that the shorter Nudt21 and Cpsf6 mRNAs are generated by alternative polyadenylation in male germ cells using proximal poly(A) signals. Both sets of transcripts contain CFlm binding sites within their 3 '-untranslated regions. suggesting autoregulation of CFlm subunit formation in male germ cells. CFIm subunit mRNA and protein levels exhibit distinct developmental variation during spermatogenesis. indicating stage-dependent translational and/or posttranslational regulation. CFIm binding sites were identified near the 3 ' ends of numerous male germ cell transcripts utilizing A(A/U)UAAA-independent sites. Together these findings suggest that CFIm complexes participate in alternative polyadenylation directed by noncanonical poly(A) signals during spermatogenesis....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
67,To identify a novel regulatory factor involved in brain development or synaptic plasticity. we applied the differential display PCR method to mRNA samples from NMDA-stimulated and un-stimulated neocortical cultures. Among 64 cDNA clones isolated. eight clones were novel genes and one of them encodes a novel zinc-finger protein. HIT-4. which is 317 amino acid residues (36-38 kDa) in length and contains seven C(2)H(2) zinc-finger motifs. Rat HIT-4 cDNA exhibits strong homology to human ZNF597 (57% amino acid identity and 72% homology) and identity to rat ZNF597 at the carboxyl region. Furthermore. genomic alignment of HIT-4 cDNA indicates that the alternative use of distinct promoters and exons produces HIT-4 and ZNF597 mRNAs. Northern blotting revealed that HIT-4 mRNA (similar to 6 kb) is expressed in various tissues such as the lung. heart. and liver. but enriched in the brain. while ZNF597 mRNA (similar to 1.5kb) is found only in the testis. To evaluate biological roles of HIT-4/ZNF597. targeted mutagenesis of this gene was performed in mice. Homozygous (-/-) mutation was embryonic lethal. ceasing embryonic organization before cardiogenesis at embryonic day 7.5. Heterozygous (+/-) mice were able to survive but showing cell degeneration and vacuolization of the striatum. cingulate cortex. and their surrounding white matter. These results reveal novel biological and pathological roles of HIT-4 in brain development and/or maintenance....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Alzheimer's Disease
68,Many basic cellular processes are shared across vast phylogenetic distances. whereas sex-determining mechanisms are highly variable between phyla. although the existence of two sexes is nearly universal in the animal kingdom. However. the evolutionarily conserved DMRT1/dsx/mab3 with a common zinc finger-like DNA-binding motif. DM domain. share both similar structure and function between phyla. Here we report that six transcripts of the chicken DMRT1 were generated in gonads by multiple alternative splicing. By cDNA cloning and genomic structure analysis. we found that there were nine exons of DMRT1. which were involved in alternatively splicing to generate the DMRT1 transcripts. Northern blotting and reverse transcription (RT) PCR analysis revealed that the expression of chicken DMRT1 was testis-specific in adults. Whole-mount in situ hybridizations and RT-PCR indicated that DMRT1 b was specially expressed in embryo gonads and higher in male than female gonads at stage 31. The female gonad had stronger DMRT1 c expression than the male one. whereas DMRT1 f was detectable only in the male gonad at stage 31 of the key time of sex gonadal differentiation. The differential expression of these transcripts during gonadal differentiation provides new insight into roles of alternative splicing of DMRT1 in governing sex differentiation of the chicken....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
69,The pre-mRNA of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) is subject to exon skipping and alternative splice site selection. which can generate up to 12 isoforms. The expression and function of these variants in vivo has not yet been fully explored. In the present study. we investigated the distribution of Fmr1 exon 12 and exon 15 isoforms. Exon 12 encodes an extension of KH2 domain. one of the RNA binding domains in the FMR1 gene product (FMRP) and we show that exon 12 variant proteins differentially interact with kissing complex RNA. Alternative splicing at exon 15 produces FMRPs differing in RNA binding ability and each is distinguished by unique post-translational modifications. Using semiquantitative RT-PCR and Northern blotting. we found that particular Fmr1 exon 12 and exon 15 isoforms change during neuronal differentiation. Interestingly. Fmr1 exon 12 variants display tissue-specific and developmental differences. while exon 15-containing transcripts vary less. Altogether. the spatio-temporal plasticity of FMR1 mRNA is consistent with complex RNA processing that is mis-regulated in fragile X syndrome. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

70,Abcc4 gene codes for a protein (ABCC4) involved in the transportation of different classes of drugs outside the cells. Various important drugs transported by ABCC4 include antiviral and anticancer drugs as well as endogenous molecules such as bile acids. cyclic nucleotides. folates. prostaglandins and steroids. Alternative splicing generates multiple mRNAs that encode protein isoforms having diverse functions. In this study. we have identified a novel transcript of mouse Abcc4 gene using a combination of bioinformatics and molecular biology techniques. This transcript was found to be different from the reported transcript in having a different first exon that was found to be located on previously identified first intron. Newly identified transcript was found to be expressed across different tissues we studied and in different developmental stages. Expression level of novel and reported transcripts was studied using quantitative real-time PCR. After conceptually translating the novel transcript. various post-translational modifications were studied. Translation efficiency and predicted half life of encoded protein isoforms were analysed in silico. Molecular modelling was performed to compare the structural differences in both isoforms. The diversity at N-termini in these protein isoforms explains the diverse function of ABCC4 in mouse. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

71,Our aim of the project is to demonstrate all the protections and interlocks available in the critical equipments of power station such as Boiler. Turbine. the Alternator. and how these critical equipments are protected from abnormal conditions and parameters. The failure of any one of these equipments will lead to loss of power generation. The cost of these equipments is huge. Boiler has got protection against abnormal drum level. abnormal live steam pressure. abnormal live steam temperature. abnormal furnace pressure. Turbine has got protection against abnormal condenser vacuum. abnormal lubricating oil pressure. abnormal axial shiftand abnormal turbine speed. Similarly the generator has also got the following protections 1.10.5kv earth fault. 220kv earth fault. differential protection. incomplete phase condition. rotor earth fault. stator inter turn fault. over current protection. stator overvoltage. rotor overvoltage. These protections are classified as class a. class b and class c protections. Distributed digital controls and numerical protections relays play vital role in providing protections to critical equipments to demonstrate these protections in real sense in our project kit.

72,Various types of long-term stable relationships that individuals uphold. including cooperation and competition between group members. define social complexity in vertebrates. Numerous life history. physiological and cognitive traits have been shown to affect. or to be affected by. such social relationships. As such. differences in developmental modes. i.e. the 'altricial-precocial' spectrum. may play an important role in understanding the interspecific variation in occurrence of social interactions. but to what extent this is the case is unclear because the role of the developmental mode has not been studied directly in across-species studies of sociality. In other words. although there are studies on the effects of developmental mode on brain size. on the effects of brain size on cognition. and on the effects of cognition on social complexity. there are no studies directly investigating the link between developmental mode and social complexity. This is surprising because developmental differences play a significant role in the evolution of. for example. brain size. which is in turn considered an essential building block with respect to social complexity. Here. we compiled an overview of studies on various aspects of the complexity of social systems in altricial and precocial mammals and birds. Although systematic studies are scarce and do not allow for a quantitative comparison. we show that several forms of social relationships and cognitive abilities occur in species along the entire developmental spectrum. Based on the existing evidence it seems that differences in developmental modes play a minor role in whether or not individuals or species are able to meet the cognitive capabilities and requirements for maintaining complex social relationships. Given the scarcity of comparative studies and potential subtle differences. however. we suggest that future studies should consider developmental differences to determine whether our finding is general or whether some of the vast variation in social complexity across species can be explained by developmental mode. This would allow a more detailed assessment of the relative importance of developmental mode in the evolution of vertebrate social systems....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
73,Hardness cations are ubiquitous and abundant in source water. while the effect of hardness on the performance of coagulation for dissolved organic matter (DOM) removal in water treatment remains unclear due to the limitation of methods that can characterise the subtle interactions between DOM. coagulant and hardness cations. This work quantified the competition between coagulant Al3+ and hardness cations to bind onto DOM using absorbance spectroscopy acquired at different Al3+ concentrations in the absence and presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+. The results indicate that. in the presence of either Mg2+ or Ca2+. an increasing depression of the binding of Al3+-DOM could be observed in the differential spectra of DOM with the increasing of Mg2+ or Ca2+ at a level of 10. 100 and 1000 mu M. with the observation being more significant at higher pH from 6.5 to 8.5. The results of zeta potentials of DOM indicate that the competition of hardness cations results in the negative DOM being less efficiently neutralised by Al3+. This study demonstrates that the removal of DOM by coagulation would significantly deteriorate with the presence of hardness cations. which would compete with coagulant Al3+ to neutralise the unsaturated sites in DOM.

74,Background and ObjectivePeriodontal disease is a chronic infectious disease that results in bone loss. Many epidemiological studies have reported the progression of periodontal tissue destruction in patients with diabetes; however. the associated mechanism remains unclear. In this study. we comprehensively investigated how diabetes affects the periodontal tissue and alveolar bone loss using a ligature-induced periodontitis model in streptozotocin-induced diabetic (STZ) mice. Material and MethodsDiabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection with streptozotocin in 6-wk-old C57/BL6J male mice. A silk ligature was tied around the maxillary left second molar in 9-wk-old wild-type (WT) and STZ mice. Bone loss was evaluated at 3 and 7 d after ligation. mRNA expression levels in the gingiva between the two groups were examined by DNA microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction at 1. 3 and 7 d post-ligation. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase staining of the periodontal tissue was performed for evaluation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in histological analysis. ResultsIn the gingiva. hyperglycemia upregulated the osteoprotegerin (Opg) mRNA expression and downregulated Osteocalcin mRNA expression. In the ligated gingiva. tumor necrosis factor- (Tnf-) mRNA expression was upregulated at 1 d post-ligation in STZ mice but not in WT mice. At 3 d post-ligation. alveolar bone loss was observed in STZ mice. but not in WT mice. Significantly severe alveolar bone loss was observed in STZ mice compared to WT mice at 7 d post-ligation. Bone metabolic analysis using DNA microarray showed significant downregulation in the mRNA expression of glioma-associated oncogene homologue 1 (Gli1) and collagen type VI alpha 1 (Col6a1) at the gingiva of the ligated site in STZ mice compared to that in WT mice. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that Gli1 and Col6a1 mRNA expression levels were significantly downregulated in the gingiva of the ligated site in STZ mice compared to WT mice. Histological analysis showed lower alkaline phosphatase activity in STZ mice. In addition. an increased number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells were observed at the ligated sites in STZ mice. ConclusionsThese results suggest that an imbalance of bone metabolism causes osteoclastosis in insulin-deficient diabetes. and that alveolar bone loss could occur at an early phase under this condition....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Diabetes
75,The lung alveolar epithelium consists of type I and type II pneumocytes. In vivo. the type II cell is the progenitor cell from which the type I cell originates. When freshly-isolated type II cells are cultured under conventional conditions they rapidly lose their phenotypic properties and attain characteristics of type I cells. Taking advantage of this transdifferentiation. we sought to identify genes that are differentially expressed during culture of rat type II cells. Using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). a vacuolar-type H+ stop-ATPase (V-ATPase) C2 subunit gene (Atp6v1c2) was found to be enriched in freshly isolated rat type II cells compared to those cultured for 4 days. Northern blotting and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed the differential expression of Atp6v1c2 during in vitro culture of isolated type II cells. Expression of Atp6v1c2 was significantly reduced early during in vitro culture: almost 90% reduction was observed after 24 h of incubation as determined by real-time PCR. In situ hybridization showed that Atp6v1c2 is expressed in both bronchiolar and alveolar lung epithelial cells. an expression pattern similar to that of surfactant protein B (SP-B). Multi-tissue Northern blotting revealed a unique tissue distribution with Atp6v1c2 expression limited to lung. kidney and testis. The presence and expression of Atp6v1c2 gene transcript isoforms. resulting from alternative splicing. were also investigated. Elucidation of differential expression of Atp6v1c2 in type II cells and further studies of its regulation may provide information useful in understanding the molecular mechanism underlying phenotypic and functional changes during transdifferentiation of alveolar epithelial cells....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Alzheimer's Disease
76,Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is an oncogenic virus causing hemangiomas and myeloid tumors in chickens. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional pro-inflammatory interleukin involved in many types of cancer. We previously demonstrated that IL-6 expression was induced following ALV-J infection in chickens. The aim of this study is to characterize the mechanism by which ALV-J induces IL-6 expression. and the role of IL-6 in tumor development. Our results demonstrate that ALV-J infection increases IL-6 expression in chicken splenocytes. peripheral blood lymphocytes. and vascular endothelial cells. IL-6 production is induced by the ALV-J envelope protein gp85 and capsid protein p27 via PI3K- and NF-kappa B-mediated signaling. IL-6 in turn induced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and its receptor. VEGFR-2. in vascular endothelial cells and embryonic vascular tissues. Suppression of IL-6 using siRNA inhibited the ALV-J induced VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 expression in vascular endothelial cells. indicating that the ALV-J-induced VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 expression is mediated by IL-6. As VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 are important factors in oncogenesis. our findings suggest that ALV-J hijacks IL-6 to promote tumorigenesis. and indicate that IL-6 could potentially serve as a therapeutic target in ALV-J infections....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Lymphoma
77,Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a zinc metalloprotease. known to degrade insulin peptide and amyloid-beta (A beta); the key protein involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Considering the important role played by IDE in disease progression of AD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). we endeavored to identify the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) IDE orthologous genes and test them for their role in AD related outcomes. We employed bioinformatics. reverse genetics and molecular biology approaches towards identification and functional characterization of putative IDE candidates in C. elegans. Using in-silico analysis we have identified seven C elegans genes that possess HXXEH motif. an identifying marker of IDE. We further carried out functional analysis of the identified genes in A beta expressing C elegans strain CL4176 [myo-3/A beta 1-42 long 3'-UTR] via studying effect on A beta induced toxicity. cholinergic neuroanatomy. content of acetylcholine/acetylcholine-esterase. extent of reactive oxygen species and expression of FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. Our findings reveal that amongst the identified putative IDE orthologs. a functionally uncharacterized gene C28F5.4 had a profound effect on the tested endpoints. Knocking down C28F5.4 modulated the AD associated conditions by decreasing A beta induced toxicity. severely compromising cholinergic neuroanatomy. reducing expression of acetylcholine-transporter. decreasing acetylcholine content. elevating ROS. with no effect on DAF-16 stress-response protein. These studies provide crucial insight into the structural/functional orthology of IDEs across human and nematode species and further our understanding of the involvement of these proteins and insulin pathway in AD. Further studies could aid in identifying novel drug-targets and in understanding the common modulating factors between AD and T2DM. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

78,Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with magnesium ion (Mg2+) deficits and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) elevations in the serum or brains of AD patients. However. the mechanisms regulating IL-1 beta expression during Mg (2+) dyshomeostasis in AD remain unknown. We herein studied the mechanism of IL-1 beta reduction using a recently developed compound. magnesium-L-threonate (MgT). Using human glioblastoma A172 and mouse brain D1A glial cells as an in vitro model system. we delineated the signaling pathways by which MgT suppressed the expression of IL-1 beta in glial cells. In detail. we found that MgT incubation stimulated the activity of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) signaling pathways by phosphorylation. which resulted in IL-1 beta suppression. Simultaneous inhibition of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and PPAR gamma induced IL-1 beta upregulation in MgT-stimulated glial cells. In accordance with our in vitro data. the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injection of MgT into the ventricles of APP/PS1 transgenic mice and treatment of Ab precursor protein (APP)/PS1 brain slices suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of IL-1 beta. These in vivo observations were further supported by the oral administration of MgT for 5 months. Importantly. Mg (2+) influx into the ventricles of the mice blocked the effects of IL-1 beta or amyloid beta-protein oligomers in the cerebrospinal fluid. This reduced the stimulation of IL-1 beta expression in the cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. which potentially contributed to the inhibition of neuroinflammation.

79,The current study determined the ability of a p75(NTR) antagonistic cyclic peptide to rescue cells from beta amyloid (A beta) (1-40)-induced death. p75(NTR)-. p140(trkA)-NIH-3T3 cells or E17 foetal rat cortical neurones were incubated with I-125-NGF or I-125-A beta (1-40) and increasing concentrations of the cyclic peptide (CATDIKGAEC). Peptide ability to displace I-125-NGF or I-125-A beta (1-40) binding was determined. Duplicate cultures were preincubated with CATDIKGAEC (250 nM) or diluent and then stimulated with A beta (1-40). Peptide ability to displace A beta (1-40) binding. interfere with A beta (1-40)-induced signalling and rescue cells from A beta-mediated toxicity was determined by immunoprecipitation and autoradiography. Northern blotting. JNK activation. MTT and trypan blue assays. The peptide inhibited NGF and A beta (1-40) binding to p75(NTR). but not to p140(trkA). A beta (1-40) induced c-jun transcription (57.3% +/- 0.07%) in diluent-treated p75(NTR)-cells. but not in cells preincubated with the cyclic peptide. Also. at 250 nM. the peptide reduced A beta (1-40)-induced phsophorylation of JNK by 71.8% +/- 0.03% and protected neurones against A beta-induced toxicity as determined by: trypan blue exclusion assay (53% +/- 11% trypan blue-positive cells in diluent pretreated cultures vs. 28% +/- 5% in cyclic peptide-pretreated cultures); MTT assay (0.09 +/- 0.03 units in diluent-pretreated cells vs. 0.12 +/- 0.004 units in cyclic peptide-pretreated cells); and visualization of representative microscopic fields. Our data suggest that a cyclic peptide homologous to amino acids 28-36 of NGF known to mediate binding to p75(NTR) can interfere with A beta (1-40) signalling and rescue neurones from A beta (1-40)-induced toxicity....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Alzheimer's Disease
80,Although frontal presentations of Alzheimer's disease (fv-AD) have already been described in the literature. we still know little about patients' social cognitive abilities. especially their theory of mind (ToM). We report the case of FT. a 61-year-old woman who was diagnosed with fv-AD. Two assessments of social cognition. using a false-belief task. the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. and a task probing knowledge of social norms. were performed one year apart. FT exhibited cognitive ToM and social knowledge deficits from the onset. Affective ToM was initially preserved. but deteriorated as the disease progressed....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Alzheimer's Disease
81,Alzheimer's disease (AD). since its characterization as a precise form of dementia with its own pathological hallmarks. has captured scientists' attention because of its complexity. The last 30 years have been filled with discoveries regarding the elusive aetiology of this disease and. thanks to advances in molecular biology and live imaging techniques. we now know that an important role is played by calcium (Ca2+). Ca2+. as ubiquitous second messenger. regulates a vast variety of cellular processes. from neuronal excitation and communication. to muscle fibre contraction and hormone secretion. with its action spanning a temporal scale that goes from microseconds to hours. It is therefore very challenging to conceive a single hypothesis that can integrate the numerous findings on this issue with those coming from the classical fields of AD research such as amyloid-beta (A beta) and tau pathology. In this contribution. we will focus our attention on the Ca2+ hypothesis of AD. dissecting it. as much as possible. in its subcellular localization. where the Ca2+ signal meets its specificity. We will also follow the temporal evolution of the Ca2+ hypothesis. providing some of the most updated discoveries. Whenever possible. we will link the findings regarding Ca2+ dysfunction to the other players involved in AD pathogenesis. hoping to provide a crossover body of evidence. useful to amplify the knowledge that will lead towards the discovery of an effective therapy.

82,AimsTo explore the common effects of the clusterin (CLU) rs11136000 variant on the default mode network (DMN) in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) subjects and remitted geriatric depression (RGD) subjects. MethodsFifty-one aMCI subjects. 38 RGD subjects. and 64 cognitively normal elderly subjects underwent resting-state fMRI scans and neuropsychological tests at both baseline and a 35-month follow-up. Posterior cingulate cortex seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis was used to obtain the DMN patterns. ResultsA CLU genexdiseasextime interaction for aMCI subjects was mainly detected in the core cortical midline structures of the DMN. and the interaction for RGD subjects was mainly detected in the limbic system. However. they overlapped in two frontal regions. where consistent effects of the CLU gene on FC alterations were found between aMCI and RGD groups. Furthermore. the alterations of FC with frontal. parietal. and limbic regions compensated for episodic memory impairments in CLU-CT/TT carriers. while no such compensation was found in CLU-CC carriers. ConclusionThe CLU gene could consistently affect the DMN FC with frontal regions among individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease. and the CLU-T allele was associated with more compensatory neural processes in DMN changes....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Alzheimer's Disease
83,Young individuals better memorize initially seen faces with emotional rather than neutral expressions. Healthy older participants and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients show better memory for faces with positive expressions. The socioemotional selectivity theory postulates that this positivity effect in memory reflects a general age-related preference for positive stimuli. subserving emotion regulation. Another explanation might be that older participants use compensatory strategies. often considering happy faces as previously seen. The question about the existence of this effect in tasks not permitting such compensatory strategies is still open. Thus. we compared the performance of healthy participants and AD patients for positive. neutral. and negative faces in such tasks. Healthy older participants and AD patients showed a positivity effect in memory. but there was no difference between emotional and neutral faces in young participants. Our results suggest that the positivity effect in memory is not entirely due to the sense of familiarity for smiling faces....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
84,Chronic neuroinflammation is thought to potentiate medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy and memory decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has become increasingly important to find novel immunological biomarkers of neuroinflammation or other processes that can track AD development and progression. Our study explored which pro- or anti-inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers best predicted AD neuropathology over 24 months. Using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data (N = 285). CSF inflammatory biomarkers from mass spectrometry and multiplex panels were screened using step-wise regression. followed up with 50%/50% model retests for validation. Neuronal Pentraxin 2 (NPTX2) and Chitinase-3-like-protein-1 (C3LP1). biomarkers of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity and microglial activation respectively. were the only consistently significant biomarkers selected. Once these biomarlcers were selected. linear mixed models were used to analyze their baseline and longitudinal associations with bilateral MTL volume. memory decline. global cognition. and established AD biomarkers including CSF amyloid and tau. Higher baseline NPTX2 levels corresponded to less MTL atrophy [R-2 = 0.287. p < 0.001] and substantially less memory decline [R-2 = 0.560. p < 0.001] by month 24. Conversely. higher C3LP1 modestly predicted more MTL atrophy [R-2 = 0.083. p < 0.001]. yet did not significantly track memory decline over time. In conclusion. NPTX2 is a novel pro -inflammatory cytokine that predicts AD-related outcomes better than any immunological biomarker to date. substantially accounting for brain atrophy and especially memory decline. C3LP1 as the microglial biomarker. by contrast. performed modestly and did not predict longitudinal memory decline. This research may advance the current understanding of AD etiopathogenesis. while expanding early diagnostic techniques through the use of novel pro -inflammatory biomarkers. such as NPTX2. Future studies should also see if NPTX2 causally affects MTL morphometry and memory performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Alzheimer's Disease
85,Alzheimer's disease patients display neuropathological lesions. including the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles. Although the mechanisms causing the neurodegenerative process are largely unknown. increasing evidence highlights a critical role of immunity in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In the present study. we investigated the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) on Alzheimer's disease progression. First. we explored the effect of Tregs (CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells) and Teffs (CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells) in an adoptive transfer model. Systemic transplantation of purified Tregs into 3xTg-AD mice improved cognitive function and reduced deposition of A beta plaques. In contrast. adoptive transfer of Teffs diminished behavioral function and cytokine production. Next. we transiently depleted Treg population using an anti-CD25 antibody (PC61). Depletion of Tregs for four months resulted in a marked aggravation of the spatial learning deficits of six-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. Additionally. it resulted in decreasing glucose metabolism. as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) with F-18-2 fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([F-18] FDG) neuroimaging. Importantly. the deposition of A beta plaques and microglia/macrophage was increased in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions of the Treg depleted 3xTg-AD compared to the vehicle-treated 3xTg-AD group. Our finding suggested that systemic Treg administration ameliorates disease progression and could be an effective Alzheimer's disease treatment....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Alzheimer's Disease
86,Introduction: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) could indicate preclinical Alzheimer's disease. but the existing literature is confounded by heterogeneous approaches to studying SCD. We assessed the differential cognitive. affective. and neuroimaging correlates of two aspects of SCD: reporting high cognitive difficulties on a self-rated questionnaire versus consulting at a memory clinic. Methods: We compared 28 patients from a memory clinic with isolated SCD. 35 community-recruited elders with similarly high levels of self-reported cognitive difficulties. and 35 community-recruited controls with low self-reported cognitive difficulties. Results: Increased anxiety and amyloid beta deposition were observed in both groups with high self-reported difficulties. whereas subclinical depression and (hippocampal) atrophy were specifically associated with medical help seeking. Cognitive tests showed no group differences. Discussion: These results further validate the concept of SCD in both community-and clinic-based groups. Yet. recruitment methods influence associated biomarkers and affective symptomatology. highlighting the heterogeneous nature of SCD depending on study characteristics.

89,Considerable interest in the relationship between biodiversity and disease has recently captured the attention of the research community. with important public policy implications. In particular. malaria in the Amazon region is often cited as an example of how forest conservation can improve public health outcomes. However. despite a growing body of literature and an increased understanding of the relationship between malaria and land use/land cover change (LULC) in Amazonia. contradictions have emerged. While some studies report that deforestation increases malaria risk. others claim the opposite. Assessing malaria risk requires examination of dynamic processes among three main components: (i) the environment (i.e. LULC and landscape transformations). (ii) vector biology (e.g. mosquito species distributions. vector activity and life cycle. plasmodium infection rates). and (iii) human populations (e.g. forest-related activity. host susceptibility. movement patterns). In this paper. we conduct a systematic literature review on malaria risk and deforestation in the Amazon focusing on these three components. We explore key features that are likely to generate these contrasting results using the reviewed articles and our own data from Brazil and Peru. and conclude with suggestions for productive avenues in future research. This article is part of the themed issue 'Conservation. biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications'....,Psychology,Medical,Attention,Outdoor Health
90,How can a firm develop. distribute. and use knowledge more effectively and efficiently in ways that increase its ability to pursue an ambidextrous orientation? Synthesizing insights from social cognition and upper-echelons perspectives. we offer a new theoretical vantage point that brings the role of top management teams' cognitive structure to the fore and. in particular. the enabling influence of transactive memory systems. We argue that transactive memory provides a top management team with a system for generating. distributing. and integrating knowledge based on members' specific areas of expertise in ways that increase its ability to both differentiate and integrate strategic agendas for ambidexterity. From a multisource study of top management teams in a sample of technology-based small-to-medium-sized firms. we find that while top management teams with well-developed transactive memory systems are able to pursue an ambidextrous orientation. the impact of transactive memory is also shaped by diverse organizational experience and functional expertise within these teams. We discuss the scope and significance of these findings for theory. future research. and managerial practice....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Leadership
91,Electrical arcs emit extremely high intensity light across a wide spectrum that can damage the eye's delicate structures. such as the cornea or the retina. Developing industry safety standards to mitigate light hazards is a critical component of arc flash safety. Accurate measurement of light intensity is the first step in understanding the level of eye protection needed. Traditionally. light measurement devices are an assembly of light-detecting resistors made from cadmium sulfide (CdS) or silicon (Si) cells. However. their response times are inadequate for capturing the peak light intensity or the dynamic changes during the initial arc flash. In addition. the brightness of an arc flash is greater than the measurable light levels from traditional light measurement devices. Furthermore. the light sensitivity of traditional sensors does not match the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage luminosity function V (lambda) curve. which defines the human eye's sensitivity to bright light as a function of wavelength under typical ambient light conditions. This paper discusses a novel light measurement technique to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches. This design is capable of measuring the light intensity of the arc flash as perceived by the human eyes. These results can be used to evaluate the potential of an arc flash to harm the eyes....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Electricity
92,Background: Evidence for extreme ambient temperature effects on the risk of mental disorders (MDs) is limited. In this study. we evaluated the short-term effects of daily mean temperature on hospital admissions of MDs in Shanghai. China. Methods: We obtained daily hospital admission data for MDs. daily meteorological and ambient pollution data in Shanghai from January 2008 to December 2015. Adjusted for time trend. air pollution. relative humidity and other confounders. a quasi-Poisson generalized additive model (GAM) combined with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was used to analyze the lag-exposure-response relationship between daily mean temperature and hospital admissions for MDs. Results: Total daily hospital admissions for MDs during the study period were 93.971. With a reference of median temperature (18.3 degrees C). there was a significant positive association between the temperature above threshold (24.6 degrees C) and MD hospital admission visits at a lag of 0-1 days. The relative risks of extreme hot temperatures (33.1 degrees C. 99% percentile) over the lag 0-1 days compared to median temperature were 1.266 (95% confidence intervals: 1.074-1.493). No effect of cold weather on the hospital admissions for MDs was observed. Conclusions: This study suggests that extreme hot temperature poses significant risks on MD; health counseling and cooling measures should be considered for the susceptible population.

95,The modifiable areal unit problem and the ecological fallacy are known problems that occur when modelling multiscale spatial processes. We investigate how these forms of spatial aggregation error can guide a regionalization over a spatial domain of interest. By regionalization' we mean a specification of geographies that define the spatial support for areal data. This topic has been studied vigorously by geographers but has been given less attention by spatial statisticians. Thus. we propose a criterion for spatial aggregation error. which we minimize to obtain an optimal regionalization. To define the criterion we draw a connection between spatial aggregation error and a new multiscale representation of the Karhunen-Loeve expansion. This relationship between the criterion for spatial aggregation error and the multiscale Karhunen-Loeve expansion leads to illuminating theoretical developments including connections between spatial aggregation error. squared prediction error. spatial variance and a novel extension of Obled-Creutin eigenfunctions. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through an analysis of two data sets: one using the American Community Survey and one related to environmental ocean winds....,Psychology,MAE,Attention,Hydraulics
96,ObjectiveWe examined the relationship between American Indian men's attitudes toward pregnancy prevention. STI/HIV prevention. and sexual risk behavior. Attention was given to: (1) attitudes and intentions to use condoms and sexual risk behavior; (2) STI/HIV prevention characteristics and sexual risk behavior; (3) attitudes toward abstinence and monogamy and sexual risk behavior; and (4) decision-making in relationships and sexual risk behavior. Study DesignOur sample included 120 heterosexual American Indian men aged 18 to 24 living on a reservation. Data were collected during in-depth interviews. A community-based participatory research framework was used to ensure the relevancy and acceptability of the study given the sensitivity of the topic. Principal FindingsResults demonstrated that attitudinal factors were associated with sexual risk behavior. particularly inconsistent condom use. Attitudes associated with consistent condom use suggested greater levels of positive dispositions toward prevention and intention to use condoms. Consistent condom use was associated with more cautious attitudes toward sex with multiple sex partners. Study results suggested that American Indian men who reported sex with multiple partners exhibited a set of attitudes and beliefs toward pregnancy prevention and STI/HIV prevention that corresponded with a disposition resulting from their behaviors. in that engaging in sexual risk behavior elevated their levels of risk perception. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that heterosexual American Indian men living in rural environments need sexual and reproductive health programs and clinical services that address differing attitudes toward condom use within the context of multiple sex partners and sexual risk behavior....,Psychology,Medical,Attention,HIV/AIDS

98,Aminoacylase 1 (ACY1) is important for regulating the proliferation of numerous types of cancer. However. the expression and mechanisms underlying the function of ACY1 in colorectal cancer remain unclear. In order to investigate the expression and function of ACY1 in colorectal cancer. tumor tissue and blood samples were collected for analysis from 132 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and western blotting identified significantly increased expression of ACY1 mRNA in colorectal tumor tissue (P<0.05 vs. adjacent normal tissue) and notably increased ACY1 protein levels. This ACY1 mRNA expression was found to be positively correlated with tumor stage. In addition. plasma ACY1 concentration was increased in patients with colorectal cancer compared with healthy controls. Furthermore. in vitro knockdown of ACY1 in human colorectal cancer HT-29 cells was shown to inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis. This effect was found to be associated with the activation of ERK1 and TGF-beta 1 signaling. In conclusion. the results of the present study suggest that ACY1 promotes tumor progression. and thus may be a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
99,Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal crystal proteins bind to cell-surface receptors which represent a family of aminopeptidases [APN (aminopeptidase N)] present on the brush border membrane of insect midgut cells of susceptible insects leading to pore formation and death of the insect. We report here for the first time the presence of a novel APN in the fat body of the moth Achaea janata. Northern blotting detected at least one APN-specific transcript in the fat body. whereas two transcripts of different sizes were detected in the midgut. We have cloned two full-length APN cDNAs of 3015 bp and 2850 bp from fat body and midgut respectively. which encode proteins of 1004 and 950 amino acids. These two APNs share only 33% amino acid sequence identity. but both display the typical APN features. such as the N-terminal signal peptide. several putative glycosylation sites. C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor signal. the APN-specific zinc-binding/gluzincin motif HEXXHX18E and gluzincin motif GAMENWG. The fat body APN manifested a variation in its expression with respect to tissue and developmental stage. In spite of the abundance of the APN transcript in the fat body. fairly low APN activity was detected in this tissue. The fat-body-and midgut-specific APNs showed differential interaction with various Cry1A toxins. Besides. the level of toxicity of different Cry subtypes varied enormously with mode/site of delivery. such as intrahaemocoelic injections and feeding bioassays. These data indicate that the fat body might be a potential alternative Cry toxin target site in the moth....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
0,The long-term cardiac effects of amiodarone resemble many aspects of hypothyroidism. The anti-arrhythmic potential of amiodarone may therefore be the result of a drug-induced. local hypothyroid-like condition. To investigate this controversial issue. we compared gene expression profiles in the hearts of rats treated with amiodarone with those of rats with hypothyroidism. Wistar male rats were assigned to 3 groups (n = 6-8): Control. systemic hypothyroidism (Hypothyroidism) and amiodarone treatment (Amiodarone. 150 mg/kg/day. p.o.. 4 weeks). Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. gene profiling by DNA microarray and Northern blotting were carried out. Amiodarone. like Hypothyroidism. caused significant prolongation of RR and QT intervals in ECGs. Microarray analysis of 8435 genes in the left ventricular myocardium revealed a significant similarity in expression profiles between Hypothyroidism and Amiodarone (R=0.63. p<0.00001). The gene expression profiles of Hypothyroidism and Amiodarone showed closer correlation when top 100 up-regulated and 100 down-regulated genes in Hypothyroidism. (total 200 genes)were analyzed (R=0.78.p<0.00001). Northern blots of left ventricular myocardium. showed a parallel decrease in mRNAs for myosin heavy chain (MHC)-alpha and a parallel increase for myosin heavy chain (MHC)-beta in Hypothyroidism and Amiodarone. In the liver and pituitary. in contrast. Northern blots showed quite different changes in the transcripts of the representative T3-responsive genes in the Hypothyroidism and Amiodarone. In conclusion. long-term treatment with amiodarone causes cardioselective hypothyroid-like alterations in gene expression profiles. The potent anti-arrhythmic activity of amiodarone may be attributable. in part at least. to this unique transcriptional remodeling. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

1,RNA interference (RNAI) is a powerful tool for functional gene analysis. which has been successfully used to down-regulate the levels of specific target genes. In this study a microRNA 159a-based binary vector was constructed which can be used for hpRNA expression. Hairpin (hp) RNA expression cassettes carrying the gene sequences are typically constructed on binary plasmid and delivered into plant cells by Agrobacteriurn-mediated genetic transformation. This system allows simple insertion of 21- nt target gene sequences into microRNA backbone. to facilitate the processing of microRNA hpRNA by the endogenous machinery of host. thereby producing artificial microRNA carrying the sequence of target gene(s). The functionality of new vector system was tested by silencing viral gene in transgenic plants. Strong down regulation of viral gene was observed in virus infected tobacco plants transformed with PAmiR(159) vector. The processing of amiRNA leading to viral-specific siRNA was confirmed by northern blotting. This vector system provides an important addition to the plant molecular biologists' toolbox. which will significantly facilitate the use of RNAi technology for analyses of various gene functions in plant cells....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Northern blotting
2,Context: Amitriptyline. a tricyclic antidepressant is used for the management of psychological disorders and various types of pain. In the previous work. it is founded that amitriptyline inhibited the migration of polymorphonuclear (PMN) into the site of inflammation. Aims: To evaluate the effect of amitriptyline on the expression of some inflammatory mediators such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1). vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1). cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Methods: An in vitro model system of LPS-stimulated human endothelial cells and U-937 macrophages and also in vivo model of carrageenan-induced paw edema in rat were used. The expression of inflammatory mediator genes was determined by qRT-Real-time PCR. In endothelial cells. soluble forms of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were quantified by ELISA. Results: The expression of ICAM-1. VCAM-1. COX2. iNOS. sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 significantly decreased by amitriptyline. The finding of this study also confirmed that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of amitriptyline inhibited carrageenan-induced inflammation in rat paw edema. Conclusions: The results of the present study provide further evidence for the anti-inflammatory effect of amitriptyline. This effect appears to be mediated by down-regulation of inflammatory genes....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Ankylosing Spondylitis
3,A cDNA sequence OsMT3 was initially isolated from the subtractive cDNA library of ammonium-fed rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaves. which was further confirmed by Northern blot to be highly ammonium-up-regulated as compared to nitrate. Its full-length cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR. and in silico analysis reveals that the cDNA includes an open reading frame of 186 bp and encodes a rice metallothionein type 3 peptide. Northern blotting analysis showed that OsMT3 gene predominantly expressed in rice leaves. weakly in stems. and barely in buds and roots. The gene transcripts in leaves were significantly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG). low temperature. NaCl and Cu2+. but not by Pb2+. Activities of three anti-oxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase. catalase and peroxidases) and two non-enzymic antioxidants (reduced ascorbate and reduced glutathione) little differed in ammonium-and nitrate-fed rice leaves. indicating that the induced OsMT3 expression was not mediated by ammonium-elicited oxidative signals....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
4,Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the application of mucous membrane keratinocyte cultures on amniotic membrane and on poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) Purasorb PL38 to cover tissue loss in the oral cavity. Developments in molecular biology techniques and tissue engineering allow the culturing and identification of cells that can be anchored in the wound to achieve integrity of the tissue. Transplantation of tissues obtained from the patient's own cells is superior to allogenous transplantation where there is a possibility of transfection. rejection and the need for long-term immunosuppression. Methods: In 9 patients (15 procedures) keratinocytes cultured on amniotic membrane and PLLA were transplanted to cover antro-oral fistulas and bone loss after osteoradionecrosis. Results: In all 6 patients with outlasting antro-oral fistulas. the defects were healed. In 3 patients with 5 cases of tissue loss after osteoradionecrosis. we obtained healing of the wound in only 1 case. Histological examination of the cultures indicated that cultured cells formed well-differentiated layers. very similar to the keratinocytes of mucous membranes. although those seeded on amniotic membrane formed a single layer of cells. while those seeded on the PLLA scaffold were arranged on 2 or more layers: these differences were shown to be statistically significant with a morphometric analysis. Conclusions: Autologous transplants of epithelium cultured on amniotic membrane and PLLA constitute a new and effective way of covering nonhealing tissue loss in the oral cavity in chosen cases. using modern methods of tissue engineering....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Skin Care
5,In this paper. we presented a novel operational amplifier (op-amp) only with solution-processed n-type amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs). The a-IGZO TFTs and common-source amplifier were fabricated on glass substrate through the solution process and confirmed to show stable electrical characteristics suitable for display driving circuits. Based on the experimental results. we designed an op-amp to have an overall gain of 30.5 dB. a cut-off frequency of 1.47 kHz. and a unit gain frequency of 6.65 kHz when supply voltage was +/- 15 V. Finally. by constituting the comparator. the proposed op-amp is expected to be used in power control and driving systems for display applications....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Operational amplifier
6,In this paper. we present an operational amplifier (op-amp) and a pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) controller fabricated with amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide thin-film transistors (a-InGaZnO TFTs). to build an adaptive dc-dc converter for display driving systems. The fabricated a-InGaZnO TFT presents electrical characteristics suitable for accomplishing an op-amp composed only with n-type TFTs to have an overall gain of 24.5 dB. a cutoff frequency of 6 kHz. and a unit gain frequency of 32 kHz operating at +/- 15 V. The fabricated op-amp is used to construct a comparator and an error amplifier on the glass. which are combined to realize a PWM controller. The resulting PWM controller can successfully control the output voltage of an external dc-dc converter that follows the input voltage to the error amplifier. and can operate at 100 Hz to control the duty ratio from 24.3% to 66.1% when the reference voltage varies from 2 to 6 V. respectively....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Operational amplifier
7,Background and ObjectiveBacteria in the dental biofilm surrounding marginal gingival grooves cause periodontal diseases. Numerous bacteria within the biofilm consume nutrients from the gingival crevicular fluid. Furthermore. some gram-negative bacteria in mature dental biofilms produce butyrate. Thus. gingival epithelial cells in close proximity to mature dental biofilms are at risk of both starvation and exposure to butyrate. In the present study. we determined the combined effects of starvation and butyrate exposure on gingival epithelial cell death and the underlying mechanisms. Material and MethodsThe Ca9-22 cell line was used as an in vitro counterpart of gingival epithelial cells. Cell death was measured as the amount of total DNA in the dead cells using SYTOX Green dye. which penetrates through membranes of dead cells and emits fluorescence when it intercalates into double-stranded DNA. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity. the amount of autophagy. and acetylation of histone H3 were determined using western blot. Gene expression levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3b (lc3b) were determined using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. ResultsButyrate-induced cell death occurred in a dose-dependent manner whether cells were starved or fed. However. the induction of cell death was two to four times higher when cells were placed under starvation conditions compared to when they were fed. Moreover. both starvation and butyrate exposure induced AMPK activity and autophagy. While AMPK inactivation resulted in decreased autophagy and butyrate-induced cell death under conditions of starvation. AMPK activation resulted in butyrate-induced cell death when cells were fed. Combined with the results of our previous report. which demonstrated butyrate-induced autophagy-dependent cell death. the results of this study suggest that the combination of starvation and butyrate exposure activates AMPK inducing autophagy and subsequent cell death. Notably. this combination markedly induced LC3B production and the induction was attenuated by AMPK inhibition. LC3B knockdown. in turn. significantly decreased butyrate-induced cell death. Therefore. AMPK-dependent LC3B induction apparently plays an important role in butyrate-induced cell death. There was a lack of correspondence between the levels of AMPK activation and LC3B induction; this may reflect the histone deacetylase-inhibitory capacity of butyrate on histone proteins. ConclusionTaken together. starvation and butyrate exposure promote autophagy via AMPK signaling. while the histone deacetylase-inhibitory effects of butyrate alter chromatin to transcriptionally active state. resulting in strong LC3B induction and subsequent cell death. These findings may help improve the understanding of the cellular processes underlying periodontal disease initiation....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Digestive Health
8,MicroRNAs (miRs) have emerged as important clinical biomarkers with both diagnostic and prognostic value for relevant diseases. such as cancer. MiRs pose unique challenges for detection and are currently detected by northern blotting. real-time PCR. and microarray techniques. These expensive. complicated. and time-consuming techniques are not feasible for on-site miR determination. In this study. amperometric magnetobiosensors involving RNA-binding viral protein p19 as a selective biorecognition element were developed for miR quantification. The p19-based magnetosensors were able to detect 0.4 fmol of a synthetic target and endogenous miR-21 (selected as a model for its role in a wide variety of cancers) in only 2 h in total RNA extracted from cancer cells and human breast-tumor specimens without PCR amplification and sample preprocessing. These results open up formidable perspectives for the diagnosis and prognosis of human cancers and for drug-discovery programs....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Cancer
9,In this brief. a 1-V potentiostat circuit for a glucose sensor has been proposed. Test results of this 1-V potentiostat demonstrate high linearity with respect to glucose concentration. which is comparable with conventional potentiostat designs. This high linearity is achieved with the help of a transconductance enhanced bulk-driven operational amplifier. The overall current consumption of the circuit is around 22 mu A. The potentiostat is tested as a glucose biosensor for glucose concentration ranging from 0 to 30 mM. The design is realized in a 0.35-mu m bulk-CMOS process. and the area for the core layout is 0.13 mm(2). The proposed low-power potentiostat can be incorporated in an implantable glucose sensor system due to its low-power operation and small footprint....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Operational amplifier
10,Here we report a homologue of the apolipoprotein D gene (AniphiApoD) in amphioxus. Branchiostoma belcheri tsingtauense. the first such finding in a basal chordate cephalochordate. The main features of the protein predicted from AmphiApoD are characteristic of the apolipoprotein D. Phylogenetic analysis places AmphiApoD at the base of the phylogenetic tree. suggesting that AmphiApoD is the archetype of the vertebrate ApoD genes. Both whole mount in situ hybridization and Northern blotting and RT-PCR as well as in situ hybridization histochemistry reveal that AmphiApoD is expressed in tissues derived from mesoderm and endoderm including notochord and hind-gut. which contrasts with the strong expression patterns of ApoD genes in the ectodermal derivatives in mammals and birds. The expression profiles of the ApoD gene may have been changed to be expressed in the endo-mesodermal derivatives in amphioxus after the vertebrate and cephalochordate lineages diverged; alternatively. the ApoD gene may first have been expressed in the endo-mesoderm during embryogenesis in the last common ancestor of all chordates. and subsequently came to be expressed in the ectodermal derivatives of vertebrates including mammals and birds.

11,In vertebrates. many responses to stress as well as homeostatic maintenance of basal metabolism are regulated by plasma glucocorticoid hormones (GCs). Despite having crucial functions. levels of GCs are typically variable among individuals. We examined the contribution of several physiological factors to individual variation in plasma corticosterone (CORT) and the number of corticotropinreleasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the magnocellular preoptic area of the brain in free-living Allegheny Mountain dusky salamanders. We addressed three hypotheses: the current-condition hypothesis. the facilitation hypothesis and the trade-off hypothesis. Differential white blood cell count was identified as a strong contributor to individual variation in baseline CORT. stress-induced CORT and the number of CRH neurons. In contrast. we found no relationship between CORT (or CRH) and body condition. energy stores or reproductive investment. providing no support for the current-condition hypothesis or the tradeoff hypothesis involving reproduction. Because of the difficulties of interpreting the functional consequences of variation in differential white blood cell counts. we were unable to distinguish between the facilitation hypothesis or the trade-off hypothesis related to immune function. However. the strong association between differential white blood cell count and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal (HPA/I) activation suggests that a more thorough examination of immune profiles is critical to understanding variation in HPA/I activation....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Immunology,Immunology
12,Resource availability can significantly alter host-parasite dynamics. Abundant food can provide more resources for hosts to resist infections. but also increase host tolerance of infections by reducing competition between hosts and parasites for food. Whether abundant food favors host resistance or tolerance (or both) might depend on the type of resource that the parasite exploits (e.g.. host tissue vs. food). which can vary based on the stage of infection. In our study. we evaluated how low and high resource diets affect Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) resistance and tolerance of a skin-penetrating. gut nematode Aplectana sp. at each stage of the infection. Compared to a low resource diet. a high resource diet enhanced frog resistance to worm penetration and tolerance while worms traveled to the gut. In contrast. a low resource diet increased resistance to establishment of the infection. After the infection established and worms could access food resources in the gut. a high resource diet enhanced host tolerance of parasites. On a high resource diet. parasitized frogs consumed significantly more food than non-parasitized frogs; when food was then restricted. mass of non-parasitized frogs did not change. whereas mass of parasitized frogs decreased significantly. Thus. a high resource diet increased frog tolerance of established worms because frogs could fully compensate for energy lost to the parasites. Our study shows that host-parasite dynamics are influenced by the effect of resource availability on host resistance and tolerance. which depends on when parasites have access to food and the stage of infection....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,HIV/AIDS
13,A full length amphioxus cDNA. encoding a novel phosducin-like protein (Amphi-PhLP). was identified for the first time from the gut cDNA library of Branchiostoma belcheri. It is comprised of 1 550 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 241 amino acids. with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 28 kDa. In situ hybridization histochemistry revealed a tissue-specific expression pattern of Amphi-PhLP with the high levels in the ovary. and at a lower level in the hind gut and testis. hepatic caecum. gill. endostyle. and epipharyngeal groove. while it was absent in the muscle. neural tube and notochord. In the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the expression plasmid pEGFP-N1/Amphi-PhLP. the fusion protein was targeted in the cytoplasm of CHO cells. suggesting that Amphi-PhLP is a cytosolic protein. This work may provide a framework for further understanding of the physiological function of Amphi-PhLP in B. belcheri....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Cell biology
14,Promethins have been shown to be present in the vertebrates examined so far. yet little is known to date about them in invertebrates. Here we isolated a cDNA encoding a promethin-like homolog from the gut cDNA library of the amphioxus Branchiostoma belcheri. a cephalochordate occupying a nodal position transient from invertebrates to vertebrates. It contained a 504 bp open reading frame corresponding to a protein of 167 amino acids. Primary structural examination showed that the deduced promethin-like homolog was a transmembrane protein with three potential transmembrane helices. resembling the vertebrate promethins. Phylogenetic analysis showed that B. belcheri promethin-like homolog was located at the base of the vertebrate counterparts. suggesting that it represents the archetype of vertebrate promethins. Both Northern blotting and in situ hybridization histochemistry revealed a tissue-specific expression pattern of promethin-like gene. like that of mammalian promethins. This is the first report on invertebrate promethin-like homolog. paving the way for further insights into the evolution and function of promethins....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
15,An amphioxus cDNA. AmphiGM2AP. encoding GM2 activator protein was isolated from the gut cDNA library of Branchiostoma belcheri. It is 907 by long. and its longest open reading frame codes for a precursor protein consisting of 242 amino acid residues with a signal peptide of 14 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence includes a conserved domain typical of GM2APs between residues 53 and 224. a single N-linked glycosylation site at position 65 and 8 conserved cysteines. Phylogenetic analysis showed that amphiGM2AP forms a club together with invertebrate GM2APs. indicating that AmphiGM2AP is evolutionarily closely related to invertebrate GM2APs rather than vertebrate ones. Both Northern blotting and in situ hybridization histochemistry analyses revealed a tissue-specific expression pattern of AmphiGM2AP in adult amphioxus with the strongest expression in the digestive system. which is in contrast to the widespread expression pattern of human. mouse and sheep GM2AP genes. It is suggested that AmphiGM2AP is possibly involved in the take-in of digested food components like lipid molecules....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
16,A nifU- like gene exhibiting similarity to nifU of nitrogen fixation gene cluster was identified for the first time from the gut cDNA library of amphioxus Branchiostoma belcheri. Both RT- PCR and Northern blotting as well as in situ hybridization histochemistry verified that the cDNA represents an amphioxus nifU- like gene rather than a microbial contaminant. The nifUlike gene encodes a protein of 164 amino acid residues including a highly- conserved U- type motif ( C-X-26 -C-X-43 -C). and shares 66 - 86% identity to NifU- like proteins from a variety of species including vertebrates. invertebrates and microbes. It is expressed in a tissue- specific manner in the digestive system including epipharyngeal groove. endostyle. hepatic caecum and hindgut and in the gill. ovary and testis. Taken together. it is highly likely that NifU- like protein plays some tissue- dependent and critical role in amphioxus....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics

18,The cDNA AmphiP23.encoding an amphioxus p23. was identified from the gut cDNA library of amphioxus Branchiostoma belcheri. It contains a 513 bp open reading frame corresponding to a deduced protein of 170 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis shows that vertebrate and invertebrate p23/p23-like proteins are each grouped together. with AmphiP23 falling at the base of vertebrate p23/p23-like clade. suggesting that the divergence of vertebrate and invertebrate p23 genes probably occurs prior to the split of invertebrate/vertebrate from a common ancestor around 550 million years ago. Northern blotting reveals a ubiquitous expression pattern of AmphiP23 in all adult tissues examined. while whole mount in situ hybridization demonstrates a tissue- and stage-specific expression pattern of AmphiP23 in developing embryos and larvae. Presumably. the ubiquitous expression pattern of AmphiP23 in adult amphioxus represents the ancestral type of p23 gene prior to its split to human paralogs p23 and tsp23. while the tissue- and stage-specific expression pattern during early embryonic development implicates a role of AmphiP23 in anterior/posterior patterning.

20,Trypsin has been documented in a variety of species including both vertebrates and invertebrates. but little is known about it in amphioxus. a model organism for insights into the origin and evolution of vertebrates. Here we identified a trypsin gene in Branchiostoma japonicum. The cDNA was 978 bp long with an ORF encoding a deduced protein of 272 amino acids. The deduced protein had an N-terminal signal peptide of 15 amino acids. a 16 activation peptide with the typical cleavage site Arg/Ile. a Tryp_SPc domain with the catalytic triad His(72)-Asp(118)-Ser(215) and the S1 substrate binding residue Asp(209). which are all characteristic of trypsinogens. The recombinant trypsin protein was able to hydrolyse the trypsin prototypic substrate BAEE. which was inhibited by the trypsin-specific inhibitor soybean trypsin inhibitor. Both northern blotting and tissue-section in situ hybridization demonstrated that trypsin gene was expressed in a tissue-specific manner. with most abundant levels in the hepatic caecum. mid-gut and ovary. And the whole mount in situ hybridization showed that it began to express in the middle third of the full-length primitive gut in 2-day larvae. where the hepatic caecum will form later during development. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that both amphioxus and ascidian trypsins are more closer to each other than to vertebrate trypsins. suggesting a continuous evolutionary divergence of vertebrate trypsins after split from protochordate/vertebrate common ancestor....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Enzymology
21,Amphiregulin and epiregulin belong to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family. and act as mitogenic stimulators via binding to EGF receptors (EGFRs). Amphiregulin and epiregulin are thought to play a role in regenerative responses in the gastrointestinal tract. In this study. we investigated secretion of amphiregulin and epiregulin in human colonic subepithelial myofibroblasts (SEMFs). The mRNA expression and protein secretion of amphiregulin and epiregulin were evaluated by Northern blotting and Western blotting. respectively. The trophic effects of amphiregulin and epiregulin on SEMFs were analyzed by MTT assays. Amphiregulin and epiregulin mRNAs were not detected in unstimulated SEMFs. Among the various cytokines and growth factors. interleukin-1 beta. tumor necrosis factor-alpha. and EGF strongly induced amphiregulin and epiregulin mRNA expression. These responses were markedly reduced by AG1478. a specific inhibitor of EGF receptor tyrosine kinases. Amphiregulin and epiregulin secretion were also detected at the protein level. MTT assays demonstrated that amphiregulin and epiregulin stimulate the proliferation of SEMFs. We demonstrated expression of amphiregulin and epiregulin in SEMFs. Amphiregulin and epiregulin may play an important role in the mechanism underlying wound healing in damaged colonic mucosa....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Digestive Health
22,Purpose: To report the outcomes of primary transconjunctival 23-gauge (23-G) vitrectomy in the diagnosis and treatment of presumed endogenous fungal endophthalmitis (EFE). Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with EFE who underwent diagnostic transconjunctival 23-G vitrectomy at a tertiary referral center. Results: Nineteen eyes of 15 patients with EFE were included in the study. Four patients had bilateral and 11 patients unilateral disease. Sixteen eyes of 15 patients underwent 23-G vitrectomy to confirm the diagnosis using vitreous culture. polymerase chain reaction. and histopathologic examinations. All affected eyes were treated with intravitreal amphotericin B 5 mu g/0.1 mL. Fourteen patients received additional systemic antifungal therapy. Diagnostic 23-G vitrectomy confirmed the diagnosis of EFE in 75% of the eyes (12/16). Candida was found to be a causative agent in 62.5% and Aspergillus in 12.5% of the eyes. Retinal detachment was the most common complication (42% of eyes). Conclusions: EFE can be easily confirmed using primary 23-G vitrectomy....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Fungal Infection
23,Several frequency compensation schemes have been proposed to stabilize multistage amplifiers with negative feedback. The performance of these amplifiers can be analyzed by inspecting their inputoutput transfer function as representation of their frequency response. With many circuit elements affecting the output response. it is relatively difficult to obtain the real transfer function of multistage amplifiers based on only the original small-signal expressions. Instead. certain techniques such as Miller's theorem are used to approximate important parameters such as DC gain and dominant pole. These methods are not generally helpful for approximating the nondominant poles which have a critical role on the loop stability of nano-scale amplifiers. With this issue in mind. this work proposes a systematic methodology to achieve the pole expressions of multistage amplifiers with frequency compensation. The key in the proposed technique is to model the equivalent impedance of the compensation loop at the output. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been verified through comparison between the transfer functions obtained from theory and those transfer functions found in the literature.

24,Recently. there are revolutionary achievements in silicon-based conventional terahertz (THz) and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) integrated circuits. particularly with the advancement of CMOS technology. However. unlike Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFICs). innovative designs and lack of various circuit techniques still remain unknown in THz gap. In this paper. a multi-band THz amplifier is presented in 40 nm CMOS technology with adaptive band selection technique. The smart amplifier is able to adjust the band of operation with respect to input signal power and frequency. In addition. the circuit performance will be adjusted to achieve maximum power gain. In order to achieve multi-band external neutralization. self-healing technique is vastly utilized by means of tunable transmission lines (TTLs).

25,A signal- and transient-current boosting (STCB) circuit is proposed and applied to a single-stage amplifier driving large capacitive loads. The proposed STCB circuit provides gain-bandwidth product (GBW) extension. slew-rate (SR) improvement and gain enhancement to the amplifier. with only slight alterations to the frequency response and transient response of the single-stage amplifier driving large capacitive loads. No on-chip capacitor or resistor is required. The STCB amplifier is fabricated in a commercial 0.18-mu m CMOS technology. The active chip area is 0.00705 mm(2). The supply is 1.8 V. and the current consumption is 20.3 mu A. The capacitive load (C-O) ranges from about 4.4 nF to 19 nF. The measured results with a similar to 19-nF load show the small-signal figure-of-merit (FOMS = GBW . C-O/power) and the large-signal large-figure-of-merit (FOML = SR .

26,Reconfigurable analog/mixed signal (AMS) platforms in scaled CMOS technology nodes are gaining importance due to the increased design cost. effort and shrinking time-tomarket. Similar to field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) for digital designs. a Programmable ANalog Device Array (PANDA) provides a flexible and versatile solution with transistor-level granularity and reconfiguration capability for rapid prototyping and validation of analog circuits. This paper presents design and synthesis methodology of a PANDA design on 65 nm CMOS technology. consisting of a 24 x 25 cell array. reconfigurable interconnect. configuration memory and serial programming interface. To implement AMS circuits on the PANDA platform. this paper further proposes a CAD tool for technology mapping. placement. routing and configuration bit-stream generation. Several representative building blocks of AMS circuits. such as amplifiers. voltage and current references. filters. are successfully implemented on the PANDA platform. Dynamic reconfiguration capability of PANDA is demonstrated through input offset cancellation of an operational amplifier using an FPGA in a closed loop. Initial measurement results of PANDA implemented circuits demonstrate the potential of the methodology for rapid prototyping and hardware validation of analog circuits....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
27,Analog layout generation in the advanced CMOS design is challenging by its increasing layout constraints and performance requirements. This situation becomes more intricate by the growing parasitic variability and manufacturing reliability. To facilitate the feasibility of template-based layout migration. this paper first introduces a layout preservation. which extracts placement and routing behaviors from an existing layout into a crossing graph via constrained Delaunay triangulation. And later this crossing graph can be migrated into multiple layouts with placement and routing reconnection. The proposed approach also provides a refinement for wire to optimize the performance metrics. This approach is applied to a variable-gain amplifier. a folded-cascode operational amplifier. and a low dropout regulator. The experimental results demonstrate more possibility on layout migration. such that averagely more than 75% routing of migrated layout is generated by our approach. Additionally. it exhibits the productivity with qualified performance on different designs....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
28,This study included 168 and 85 mother-infant dyads from Asian and United States of America cohorts to examine whether a genomic profile risk score for major depressive disorder (GPRS(MDD)) moderates the association between antenatal maternal depressive symptoms (or socio-economic status. SES) and fetal neurodevelopment. and to identify candidate biological processes underlying such association. Both cohorts showed a significant interaction between antenatal maternal depressive symptoms and infant GPRS(MDD) on the right amygdala volume. The Asian cohort also showed such interaction on the right hippocampal volume and shape. thickness of the orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Likewise. a significant interaction between SES and infant GPRS(MDD) was on the right amygdala and hippocampal volumes and shapes. After controlling for each other. the interaction effect of antenatal maternal depressive symptoms and GPRS(MDD) was mainly shown on the right amygdala. while the interaction effect of SES and GPRS(MDD) was mainly shown on the right hippocampus. Bioinformatic analyses suggested neurotransmitter/neurotrophic signaling. SNAp REceptor complex. and glutamate receptor activity as common biological processes underlying the influence of antenatal maternal depressive symptoms on fetal cortico-limbic development.

29,The amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide. the proteolytic fragment of A beta precursor protein (APP). aggregates and forms neuritic plaques. a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The limiting step in generating the A beta peptide from APP is cleavage by the P-secretase enzyme. BACE1 Regulation of the BACE1 gene is likely to play an important role in AD etiology and treatment. We therefore studied the activity of a 4.1-kb F-flanking region (-3765/+364. +1 being the transcription start site) of the BACE1 gene. both in 5'- and T-deletion series and through Northern blotting. We show that the BACE1 promoter has regulatory activity throughout the 4.1-kb length. both positive and negative. and that this activity can be quantitatively modeled according to promoter sequence length. with the specific model depending on the presence of negative regulatory elements as the 5'-most portion of the sequence. We also examined a previously identified 141-bp proximal fragment (+224/+364) of the BACE1 promoter and two constituent (91- and 50-bp) subfragments. We report that the 91-bp fragment (+224/+314) is the most likely seat of neuronal expression of the BACE1 gene and that it is the portion of the 141-bp fragment that accounts for observed DNA-protein interactions in brain extracts. The 50-bp fragment (+315/+364). which showed significant reporter gene activity from the empty vector. binds nuclear proteins in a cell type-specific manner and contains the AP2 site as shown by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Overall. the 141-bp fragment had no strong matches within GenBank. and the 91-bp fragment is predicted to have several potential stem-loop sites. Taken together. BACE1 gene promoter activity is differentially regulated. and the 91-bp fragment represents a novel promoter region for cell type-specific regulation. This fragment might be a useful target to regulate BACE1 expression leading to A beta production and to understand the neuropathogenesis of AD....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Alzheimer's Disease
30,Objective: Emotion processing abilities might be reduced in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Previous studies of emotion processing in ALS have inconsistent results. and are limited by variations in task difficulty. modalities examined. and participants' cognitive status. The current study used a battery of emotion processing tasks at differing levels of difficulty and across different modalities (facial affect and voice prosody) to assess the extent of emotion processing deficits in nondemented ALS. Method: 33 ALS participants with intact basic cognition and 22 healthy controls completed the abbreviated Comprehensive Affect Testing System (CATS). which assesses simple and complex facial affect recognition. affective prosody recognition. cross-modal face-prosody integration. and semantic comprehension of affect. Participants also completed measures of executive function. mood. and functional impairment. Results: ALS participants showed impairments on complex facial affect recognition. affective prosody recognition. and cross-modal integration. In contrast. simple facial affect recognition and semantic comprehension of affect were intact. ALS participants did not have significant mood symptoms. and neither mood nor functional impairment was related to emotion processing. Performance on the cross-modal composite was related to executive function. however. this relationship was not apparent for facial or prosody recognition within a single modality. Conclusions: These results indicate that people living with ALS without dementia often have subtle difficulties with recognizing emotions in both faces and voices. even in the context of intact basic cognition. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for these emotion processing difficulties to be present in ALS and to affect interpersonal behavior and quality of life....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Dementia
31,Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive disease of the nervous system involving both upper and lower motor neurons. The patterns of structural and metabolic brain alterations are still unclear. Several studies using anatomical MRI yielded a number of discrepancies in their results. and a few PET studies investigated the effect of ALS on cerebral glucose metabolism. The aim of this study was threefold: to highlight the patterns of grey matter (GM) atrophy. hypometabolism and hypermetabolism in patients with ALS. then to understand the neurobehavioral significance of hypermetabolism and. finally. to investigate the regional differences between the morphologic and functional changes in ALS patients. using a specially designed voxel-based method. Thirty-seven patients with ALS and 37 age-and sex-matched healthy individuals underwent both structural MRI and (18)[F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET examinations. PET data were corrected for partial volume effects. Structural and metabolic abnormalities were examined in ALS patients compared with control subjects using two-sample t tests in statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Then. we extracted the metabolic values of clusters presenting hypermetabolism to correlate with selected cognitive scores. Finally. GM atrophy and hypometabolism patterns were directly compared with a one-paired t test in SPM. Results: We found GM atrophy as well as hypometabolism in motor and extra motor regions and hypermetabolism in medial temporal lobe and cerebellum. We observed negative correlations between the metabolism of the right and left parahippocampal gyri and episodic memory and between the metabolism of right temporal pole and cognitive theory of mind. GM atrophy predominated in the temporal pole. left hippocampus and right thalamus. while hypometabolism predominated in a single cluster in the left frontal superior medial cortex. Conclusions: Our findings provide direct evidence of regional variations in the hierarchy and relationships between GM atrophy and hypometabolism in ALS. Moreover. the (18)FDG-PET investigation suggests that cerebral hypermetabolism is deleterious to cognitive function in ALS....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Parkinson's Disease
32,This study aims to explore the potential impairment of Theory of Mind (ToM; i.e.. the ability to represent cognitive and affective mental states to both self and others) and the clinical. neuropsychological and Quality of Life (QoL) correlates of these cognitive abnormalities in the early stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). a multisystem neurodegenerative disease recently recognized as a part of the same clinical and pathological spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Twenty-two consecutive. cognitively intact ALS patients. and 15 healthy controls. underwent assessment of executive. verbal comprehension. visuospatial. behavioral. and QoL measures. as well as of the ToM abilities by Emotion Attribution Task (EAT). Advanced Test of ToM (ATT). and Eyes Task (ET). ALS patients obtained significantly lower scores than controls on EAT and ET. No significant difference was found between the two groups on ATT. As regard to type of ALS onset. patients with bulbar onset performed worse than those with spinal onset on ET. Correlation analysis revealed that EAT and ET were positively correlated with education. memory prose. visuo-spatial performances. and "Mental Health" scores among QoL items. Our results suggest that not only "cognitive" but also "affective" subcomponents of ToM may be impaired in the early stages of ALS. with significant linkage to disease onset and dysfunctions of less executively demanding conditions. causing potential impact on patients' "Mental Health."...,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Dementia

34,The optimal biogas system design model (OBSDM) described in this paper is intended to be used as a decision-making tool to increase awareness of the potential of biogas technology for different applications in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The decision-making tool identifies the most suitable biodigester design based on user defined inputs. including energy and fertiliser requirements; feedstock (type. amount. and rate of supply); water supply; land use (area. soil type. ground water level); climate (temperature and rainfall); construction materials available locally; and the priorities (based on sustainability criteria) of the intended biogas user. The output of the model provides a recommended design with estimates of the expected costs. energy and fertiliser production. and links to contact biodigester suppliers. In order to test the model. data from household surveys conducted in rural regions of Kenya and Cameroon were used as inputs to the model. An innovative fixed dome biodigester design. which uses stabilised soil blocks instead of bricks. was identified as optimal for both Kenyan and Cameroonian rural households. The expected performance of the optimal biogas system design from the model output was consistent with survey data on existing biogas systems in the region. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

35,To create possibilities for a more sustainable wastewater management. a novel system consisting of electrodeionization (EDI) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is proposed in this study. This system is integrated with anaerobic digestion/landfills to capture energy from carbonaceous and nitrogenous pollutants. Both EDI and SOFCs showed good performances. EDI removed 95% and 76% ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) from diluted (0.025 M) to concentrated (0.5 M) synthetic ammonium wastewaters. respectively. accompanied by hydrogen production. SOFCs converted the recovered fuels. biogas mixtures of methane and carbon dioxide. to electricity. Under the optimal conditions of EDI (3.0 V applied voltage and 7.5 mm internal electrode distance (IED). and SOFCs (750 degrees C operating temperature). the system achieved 60% higher net energy output as compared to conventional systems. The estimated energy benefit of this proposed system showed that the net energy balance ratio is enhanced from 1.11 (existing system) to 1.75 (this study) for a local Hong Kong active landfill facility with 10.0 g L-1 chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 0.21 M NH4+-N. Additionally. an average of 80% inorganic ions (heavy metals and nutrient elements) can be removed from the raw landfill leachate by EDI cell. The results are successful demonstrations of the upgrades of anaerobic processes for energy extraction from wastewater streams. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

36,There is a rapid growing interest in using biomass as an alternative source for clean and sustainable energy production. In this work. a hybrid system was developed to combine anaerobic digestion (AD) and gasification for energy recovery from yard waste and woody biomass. The feasibility of the proposed hybrid system was validated experimentally and numerically and the energy efficiency was maximized by varying energy input in the drying process. The experiments were performed in two stages. At the first stage. AD of yard waste was conducted by mixing with anaerobic sludge. At the second stage. co-gasification was added as post-treatment for the AD residue for syngas production. The co-gasification experiments of AD residue and woody biomass were conducted at varying mixing ratios and varying moisture contents of AD residue. Optimal energy efficiency was found to be 70.8% at mixing ratio of 20 wt% AD residue with 30 wt% moisture content. Two kinetic models were then adapted for prediction of biogas produced in AD process and syngas produced in gasification process. respectively. Both experimental and numerical results showed that full utilization of biomass could be realized to produce energy through the combination of these two technologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

37,Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) effectively treats esophageal high-grade dysplasia. but its efficacy in treating anal canal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) is unsubstantiated. This prospective study assessed the safety and efficacy of applying hemi-circumferential RFA to anal canal HSIL. Twenty-one HIV-negative participants with HSIL occupying aehalf the anal canal circumference were treated with hemi-circumferential anal canal RFA. Participants were assessed every 3 months for 12 months with high-resolution anoscopy; recurrence in the treatment zone was re-treated with focal RFA. Twenty-one participants with a mean of 1.7 lesions (range 1-4) enrolled and completed the trial. Six (29 %) participants had recurrent HSIL within the treated hemi-circumference within 1 year. Four participants (19 %) had persistence of an index lesion at 3 months. One (2.9 %) index HSIL persisted again at 12 months. No participants had more than two RFA treatments. KM curve-predicted HSIL-free survival within the treatment zone at 1 year was 76 % (95 % CI 52-89 %). Comparing the first 7 and last 14 participants. the predicted 1-year HSIL-free survivals are 43 % (95 % CI 10-73 %) and 93 % (95 % CI 59-99 %). respectively (p = 0.008). suggesting a learning curve with the treating physician. Multivariable analysis showed decreased recurrence in the last 14 participants (HR 0.02; 95 % CI 0.001-0.63) while increasing BMI increased recurrence (HR 1.43. 95 % CI 1.01-2.01). No participants had device or procedure-related serious adverse events. anal stricture. or heavy bleeding. Hemi-circumferential RFA yielded a high rate of anal HSIL eradication in HIV-negative patients at 1 year with minimal adverse events. Lesion persistence was probably related to incomplete initial ablation....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,HIV/AIDS
38,Aims: Verrucous carcinoma (VC) is a variant of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and in the anal region is regarded as synonymous with giant condyloma (Buschke-Lowenstein tumour) (BLT). Aetiology. diagnostic criteria and clinical behaviour of both lesions are controversial. Recent studies suggest that VC at other sites is not associated with human papillomaviruses (HPV). We hypothesized that anal VC is also not related to HPV. while BLT is a HPV-induced lesion. Methods and results: Ten cases of VC and four cases of BLT were included. Several techniques were used for HPV detection: in-situ hybridization for HPV6. 11. 16 and 18. six different polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols for detection of at least 89 HPV types from alpha-. beta-. gamma- and mu-PV genera and in-situ hybridization for high-risk HPV E6/E7 mRNA; p16 immunohistochemistry and morphometric analysis were also performed. Alpha-. gamma- and mu-PVs were not found in any case of VC. while HPV6 was detected in all cases of BLT. p16 overexpression was not present in any of the lesions. Among microscopic features. only the absence of koilocytosis and enlarged spinous cells seem to be useful to distinguish VC from BLT. Conclusions: Our results suggest that anal VC. similarly to VC at other sites. is not associated with HPV infection. and must be distinguished from BLT. which is associated with low-risk HPV. Only with well-set diagnostic criteria will it be possible to ascertain clinical behaviour and optimal treatment for both lesions....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
39,The objective of this work is to minimize testing cost of analog and RF circuits for which complete specification tests are available. We use an integer linear program (ILP) to eliminate as many tests as possible without exceeding the required defect level. The method leverages correlation among specifications. thereby avoiding the tests for specifications that are sufficiently covered by tests for other specifications. First. Monte Carlo simulation determines probabilities for each test covering all other specifications it was not originally intended for. These probabilities and the given defect level then define an ILP model for eliminating unnecessary tests. An hypothetical example illustration of ten specifications demonstrates that depending on the defect level requirement up to half of the tests may be eliminated. Monte Carlo simulation using spice for probabilistic characterization of tests versus specifications followed by ILP optimization for two commercially available integrated circuits. an operational amplifier and a radio frequency power controller (RFPC). are presented as evidence of effectiveness of the technique....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing

59,Functional errors in analog portion of mixed signal circuits become more severe and improvements in verification methods are increasingly important. Current verification methods fall into two categories. simulation-based verification and formal verification (Barke et al. [1]). focusing on verifying analog circuit function/performance. This paper proposes a novel approach verifying analog circuit design using causal reasoning. Causal reasoning is the inductive reasoning process to create a new design. The flow begins with mining the causal reasoning steps (design plan) that produced the circuit. including starting ideas. design step sequence. and their justifications (Jiao et al.. 2015 [2]).. Then. topological features corresponding to the starting ideas and design step sequence are verified individually by replacing the related devices with ideal behavior model. Performance is evaluated through Cadence Spectre simulation. Comparison with new circuit performance reveals incorrect functional issues and/or performance potentials for improvement. They are negative causes of certain starting ideas or design steps. which might have been omitted during the design process.

60,This paper presents a new family of Class-AB operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) circuits based on single-stage topologies with non-linear current amplifiers. The proposed variable-mirror amplifier (VMA) architecture is mainly characterized by generating all Class-AB current in the output transistors only. by exhibiting very low sensitivity to both technology and temperature deviations. and by avoiding the need for any internal frequency-compensation mechanism.

61,This paper presents a digital testing strategy for characterizing an analog circuit block. The operational amplifier (op amp) is evaluated due to its wide application in electronic circuits and systems. In the proposed strategy. the op amp device under test (DUT) is configured to respond to a testing pulse. and the associated output is digitized by a digital buffer to reduce the high cost of generating a high-frequency clock. The testing procedure is divided into two modes to estimate the reference slew rate and then to evaluate the practical slew rate to moderate the difficulty of designing a digital buffer that has a highly precise delay time. The testing concept. accuracy. time. and hardware are also comprehensively investigated to describe the proposed testing strategy. The digital compatibility. the simplicity. and the testing capability of the high-performance op amp are the main advantages of the proposed testing strategy.

The converter occupies 0.375 mm(2) in 0.18 mu m CMOS processes and requires two external components: 1.2 mu F capacitor and 6.8 mu H inductor....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Single-phase electric power
63,ADC/DAC radiation failures are mainly due to radiation-induced degradation of precision parameters of the transfer characteristic such as gain. zero offset. full-scale voltage. integral and differential non-linearity. conversion error. ADC/DAC radiation failure specifics is that even a slight deviation of electrical parameter of internal elements (comparator threshold. internal reference voltage. switch leakage. operational amplifier gain. etc.) often leads to significant degradation of ADC/DAC accuracy. ADC/DAC radiation test procedure and facilities are developed and test results are introduced....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
64,The work proposes an improved technique to design a low power 8-bit asynchronous successive approximation register (ASAR). an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The proposed ASAR ADC consists of a comparator. ASAR (digital control logic block). and a capacitivedigital-to-analog convertor (C-DAC). The comparator is a preamplier-based improved positive feedback latch circuit which has a built-in sample and hold (S/H) functionality and saves an enormous amount of power. The implemented digital control logic block performing the successive approximation (SA) algorithm is totally unrestrained of the external clock pulse. The outputs from the comparator are given to a XOR logic whose outputs serve as an internally generated clock (ready signal) to trigger the digital control block. Hence. an external clock is not required to initiate the digital control block making its operation asynchronous. By implementing this. the ADC can circumvent the usage of an oversampled clock and can operate on a single low-speed sample clock. This. in turn. saves power and it cuts down the required resilience in sampling rates. The proposed ADC has been designed and simulated using UMC-0.18 mu m CMOS technology which dissipates 32.18 mu W power when operated on a single 1V power supply and achieves complete 8-bit conversion in 1.09 mu s. The relative accuracy of capacitor ratio. aperture jitter and FOM are 0.39%. 1.2 ns and 125 fJ/conversion-step. respectively....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Analog signal processing
65,Due to technology scaling. the design of the conventional-type analog-to-digital converter (ADC). which uses an operational amplifier as one of its building blocks. becomes more difficult. In this brief. new techniques to design time-based ADC (TADC). which uses a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). are proposed. The VCO is followed by a time-to-digital converter. implemented in a Sigma Delta architecture. A novel architecture. using a multibit. nonlinear internal quantizer and a feedback digital-to-time converter. implemented by using phase interpolation. is employed to compensate the nonlinear transfer curve of the VCO. Dynamic element matching and calibration are used to improve the robustness of the TADC against mismatch. The TADC uses an implicit sample and hold that relaxes the bounds on input frequency. A TADC implemented in 0.13-mu m CMOS technology achieves a measured signal-to-noise + distortion ratio of 60.2 dB and a dynamic range of 11 b for a bandwidth of 2 MHz....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
66,This paper presents a 14.9-bit 3.57-MS/s algorithmic ADC that uses iterative gain enhancement. a technique that uses multiple clock phases to increase the effective op-amp gain in a switched-capacitor circuit. Using an op-amp that gives only 30-dB loop gain in a feedback circuit without gain enhancement. application of the iterative gain enhancement technique boosts the loop gain to 81 dB. The algorithmic ADC uses a capacitor sharing and scaling technique. which saves power and reduces errors. The ADC has an active area of 0.75 mm2 in 0.25-mu m CMOS and dissipates 16.2 mW. Iterative gain enhancement increases the SNDR from 44.6 dB to 78.5 dB and the SFDR from 45.9 dB to 96.2 dB. Reducing the number of gain-enhancement iterations for the LSBs increases the conversion rate from 3.57 MS/s to 4.65 MS/s with only minor performance degradation....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
67,A wide-bandwidth (BW) power-efficient continuoustime Sigma Delta modulator (CT Sigma Delta M) is presented. The modulator introduces a third-order filter implemented with a lossless integrator and a multiple-feedback single-amplifier biquadratic filter with embedded loop stability compensation. An active summing block is implemented by employing a common-gate current buffer followed by a transimpedance amplifier. This combination relaxes the specification requirements of the operational amplifier by making its required BW independent of the closed-loop gain. The proposed technique achieves optimum BW with reduced power consumption. making it functional for over gigahertz operation. Fabricated in a standard 40-nm CMOS technology. and clocked at 3.2 GHz. the CT Sigma Delta M achieves a signal-to-noiseand-distortion ratio of 65.5 dB over 75-MHz BWwhile consuming 22.8 mW of power.

69,This study presents a self-testing platform with a foreground digital calibration technique for successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). A high-accuracy digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with digital control is used for the proposed self-testing platform to generate the sinusoidal test signal. This signal is then implemented using an Arduino board. and the clock signal is generated to test the ADCs. In addition. fast Fourier transform and recursive discrete Fourier transform (RDFT) processors are adopted for dynamic performance evaluation and calibration of the ADCs. The third harmonic distortion caused by the non-linearity of the track-and-hold circuit. the mismatch of the DAC capacitor array. and the direct current (DC) offset of the comparator can be calculated using the processors to improve the ADC performance. The advantages of the proposed platform include its low cost. high integration. and no need for an extra analogy compensation circuit to deal with calibration. In this work a 12 bit SAR ADC and an RDFT processor are used in the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.. Ltd. (TSMC) 0.18 mu m standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process with a sampling rate of 18.75 kS/s to validate the proposed method. The measurement results show that the signal-to-noise and distortion ratio is 55.07 dB before calibration and 61.35 dB after calibration....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
70,This paper describes a versatile composite amplifier in which a current feedback amplifier (CFA) drives an operational amplifier (OPA). In the conventional OPA-CFA composite amplifier. an OPA drives a CFA resulting in a composite structure that combines the DC input stability of the OPA and the high speed capability of the CFA. The proposed composite configuration combines different features of the CFA and OPA. specifically the constant bandwidth property of the CFA and the high power and high current output capacity of the OPA. The new circuit is easily implemented in the standard inverting and non-inverting configurations using commercially available devices. and the accuracy and constant bandwidth features were experimentally verified. Local feedback around the associated CFA ensures that the proposed composite amplifier possesses a higher level of bandwidth constancy than a single CFA....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Operational amplifier
71,The paper presents the structure and the principle of operation of the improved' Howland current pumps (or voltage-controlled current sources (VCCSs) for a grounded load). In particular. under review is the VCCS employing power operational amplifier (op amp) and the VCCS using low power op amp and an additional power transistor. extending working dynamic range. On the basis of analysis of the operational principle. the equations for transfer functions of both circuits and formulas for the related dynamic electrical parameters are obtained. Moreover. using these formulas. a design procedure is developed. and recommendations for simulation modelling are given. The efficiency of the proposed procedure is verified by simulation modelling and experimental testing of sample electronic circuits of VCCSs. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons.

72,Analogical reasoning is an important mechanism for social cognition in typically developing children. and recent evidence suggests that some forms of analogical reasoning may be preserved in autism spectrum disorder. An unanswered question is whether children with autism spectrum disorder can apply analogical reasoning to social information. In all. 92 children with autism spectrum disorder completed a social content analogical reasoning task presented via photographs of real-world social interactions. Autism spectrum disorder participants exhibited performance that was well above chance and was not significantly worse than age- and intelligence quotient-matched typically developing children. Investigating the relationship of social content analogical reasoning performance to age in this cross-sectional dataset indicated similar developmental trajectories in the autism spectrum disorder and typically developing children groups. These findings provide new support for intact analogical reasoning in autism spectrum disorder and have theoretical implications for analogy as a metacognitive skill that may be at least partially dissociable from general deficits in processing social content. As an initial study of social analogical reasoning in children with autism spectrum disorder. this study focused on a basic research question with limited ecological validity. Evidence that children with autism spectrum disorder can apply analogical reasoning ability to social content may have long-range applied implications for exploring how this capacity might be channeled to improve social cognition in daily life....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
73,The paper aim draws together two ideas that have figured in different strands of discussion in business ethics: the ideas of intuition and of reflection. They are considered in company with the third. complementary. idea of analysis. It is argued that the interplay amongst these is very important in business ethics. The relationship amongst the three ideas can be understood by reference to parts of modern cognitive psychology. including dual-process theory and the Social Intuitionist Model. Intuition can be misleading when based on fast and frugal heuristics. and reasoning needs social exchange if it is to support moral judgment effectively. but in the complex institutional environment of business. reflection and analysis can underpin social communication and feedback to develop sound intuition. Reflection and analysis are both more deliberate. systematic judgment processes than intuition. but are distinguished by the fact that reflection embraces hypothetical thinking and imagination. while analysis is careful. step-by-step reasoning. Examples of business ethics problems illustrate the need for both of these processes. and also suggest how they themselves can be enhanced in the same social exchange process that underpins the development of good intuition....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition

75,During development of adenovirus-based vaccines. samples have to be analyzed in order to either monitor the production process or control the quality and safety of the product. An important quality attribute is the total concentration of intact adenoviruses. which currently is determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or anion exchange-HPLC. Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) was evaluated as alternative to the current methods with the aim to have one single method that allows reliable and fast quantification of adenovirus particles throughout the full process. Intact adenoviruses samples from downstream processing and upstream processing were analyzed directly by CE with UV-detection at 214 nm. Only the samples with high amounts of DNA required a simple sample pretreatment by benzonase. Adenovirus particles were separated from matrix components such as cell debris. residual cell DNA. and/or proteins on a PVA-coated capillary using a BGE consisting of 125 mM Tris. 338 mM tricine and 0.2% v/v polysorbate-20 at pH 7.7. Full factorial design of experiments was used for method optimization as part of the analytical quality by design (AQbD) method development approach. The method was validated for the quantification of adenoviruses on five representative samples from the manufacturing process in the range of 0.5 x10(11)-1.5 x10(11) adenovirus particles per ml (similar to 80 to 250 pmo1/1). The CE method showed intermediate precision of 7.8% RSD on concentration and an accuracy (spiked recovery) of 95-110%. CE proved highly useful for process development support and is being implemented for in-process control testing for adenovirus vaccine manufacturing....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Headache
76,The anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process has been recognized as a promising sewage treatment approach. Considering the susceptibility. it is meaningful to study the behaviors of anammox bacteria under the unfavorable conditions. Here. we found that anammox bacteria more probably tended to aggregation by the regulation of c-di-GMP against the unfavorable environmental stresses (low temperature. aerobic condition and low pH). Further using multiple protein sequence alignment. we systematically examined the functionality of thirteen genes encoding putative c-di-GMP metabolic enzymes in anammox organism Candidatus Jettenia caeni. revealing most of the predicted enzymes were predicted to be active. Particularly. ectopic expression of jcaA. a gene encoding a protein with both GGDEF domain and EAL domain. suggested that it encoded a functional enzyme capable of both synthesizing and degrading c-di-GMP. which was clearly confirmed by in vitro enzymatic assays and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore. the catalytic mechanism was simulated by the means of three-dimensional homology modeling and molecular docking. The identification of cdi-GMP turnover and its role in granulation for anammox organism provides a new perspective for regulation of its aggregation capability and further promotion of anammox performance in the application of wastewater treatment process.

77,Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a systemic vasculitis mediated by autologous immune complex. Animal models of HSP are scarce. Here. we describe the characteristics of HSP rabbit model in the acute and recovery phase. First. we constructed the HSP rabbit models. and then assessed immunologic indicators of models by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoturbidimetry. Histomorphological characteristics were analyzed by haematoxylin-eosin. immunofluorescence and special staining. In the acute stage (24 h) after antigen challenge. the model group rabbits featured skin ecchymosis and abnormal laboratory examination results. Three weeks following the allergic reaction. purple spots improved markedly. and edema and blood seeping decreased. but obvious inflammation was present in the skin. kidneys. joints. gastrointestinal. lung and liver. Serological results of CD4. CD/CD8. IL-2. IL-4. and TNF-alpha. IgA. IgG. TropI. Alb and T were still abnormal. IgA and C3 expressed in skin and kidney and eosinophils expressed in skin and lungs were increased. The rabbit model can mimic human HSP lesions in symptoms. pathology. and immunology and may provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis of HSP and serve as a tool for future therapeutic development targeting HSP....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Rheumatoid Arthritis
78,Anaphylaxis is an increasingly prevalent life-threatening allergic condition that requires people with anaphylaxis and their caregivers to be trained in the avoidance of allergen triggers and in the administration of adrenaline autoinjectors. The prompt and correct administration of autoinjectors in the event of an anaphylactic reaction is a significant challenge in the management of anaphylaxis. Unfortunately. many people do not know how to use autoinjectors and either fail to use them or fail to use them correctly. This is due in part to deficiencies in training and also to the lack of a system encouraging continuous practice with feedback. Assistive smartphone healthcare technologies have demonstrated potential to support the management of chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. but there have been deficiencies in their evaluation and there has been a lack of application to anaphylaxis. This paper describes AllergiSense. a smartphone app and sensing system for anaphylaxis management. and presents the results of a randomized. controlled. prepost evaluation of AllergiSense injection training and feedback tools-with healthy participants. Participants whose training was supplemented with AllergiSense injection feedback achieved significantly better practiced injections with 90.5% performing correct injections compared to only 28.6% in the paper-only control group. In addition. the results provide insights into possible self-efficacy failings in traditional training and the benefits of embedding self-efficacy theory into the technology design process....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
79,Background The mechanisms involved in the amplification of the mast cell response during anaphylaxis are unclear. Mouse models of anaphylaxis demonstrate the critical involvement of neutrophils. These innate immune cells are highly abundant in peripheral blood and can be rapidly activated to trigger both local and systemic inflammation. Objective To investigate neutrophil activation in peripheral blood during acute human anaphylaxis. Methods Patients presenting to the emergency department with anaphylaxis underwent blood sampling upon enrolment and at up to three subsequent time-points. Traditional anaphylaxis biomarkers. histamine and mast cell tryptase. were measured by ELISA and ImmunoCAP. respectively. Plasma myeloperoxidase concentrations were measured by ELISA. serum soluble CD62L concentrations by cytometric bead array. and both compared to healthy controls. Results In 72 patients. 37 (51%) had severe anaphylaxis. 33 (60%) were histamine positive. and 47 (70%) were mast cell tryptase positive. At enrolment. myeloperoxidase concentrations were 2.9- (95% CI: 1.3. 6.5) and 5.0- (95% CI: 2.4. 10.5) fold higher in moderate and severe patients. respectively. compared with healthy controls. and remained stable over the first 5 h following symptom onset. At enrolment. soluble CD62L was 29% (95% CI: 19. 38) and 31% (95% CI: 22. 40) lower in moderate and severe patients. respectively. than healthy controls. and was stable over the first 5 h. There were no associations between myeloperoxidase or soluble CD62L concentrations and either histamine or mast cell tryptase concentrations. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance These results provide compelling evidence for the involvement of neutrophils during acute human anaphylaxis. suggesting they are activated early in the reaction. regardless of mast cell activation. This important finding increases our understanding of the basic mechanisms of anaphylaxis. a necessary precursor to improving treatment and prevention....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
80,BACKGROUND: Anaphylaxis diagnostic criteria were proposed at the Second Symposium on the Definition and Management of Anaphylaxis. These criteria were 97% sensitive and 82% specific when retrospectively validated. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria for diagnosis of anaphylaxis in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of patients seen in our institution's ED from April 2010 to March 2013. Patients seeking care for an allergic reaction and possible anaphylaxis were enrolled. Patients and providers completed questionnaires regarding onset. trigger. and signs and symptoms. Records were reviewed independently and blindly by 2 board-certified allergist-immunologists. and their final diagnosis (anaphylaxis vs no anaphylaxis) was used as the reference standard. Two-by-two tables were built. and test characteristics were calculated. RESULTS: Among the 174 enrolled patients. 91 (52%) met the NIAID/FAAN criteria for anaphylaxis. The allergist-immunologists diagnosed 61 cases of anaphylaxis (35%). of which 58 (95%) also satisfied the NIAID/FAAN criteria. The interrater agreement between allergist-immunologists was substantial (k = 0.7). Test characteristics (95% CIs) of the NIAID/FAAN criteria were as follows: sensitivity. 95.1% (85.4%-98.7%); specificity. 70.8% (61.4%-78.8%); positive predictive value. 63.7% (52.9%-73.4%); negative predictive value. 96.4% (89.1%-99.1%); positive likelihood ratio. 3.26; and negative likelihood ratio. 0.07. CONCLUSIONS: Prospectively. the NIAID/FAAN criteria continued to be highly sensitive (95%) but had lower specificity (71%) than on retrospective assessment. These criteria are likely to be useful for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis in the ED. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy. Asthma & Immunology...,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
81,Background: High serum basal tryptase (sBT) levels have been identified as a risk factor for both venom-and food-induced severe allergic reactions. The aim of this study was to compare sBT levels in children with different severity of actual drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) with those of age-and sex-matched controls without any history of DHRs. Method: Patients between 0 and 18 years of age with a history of immediate-type DHRs manifested in 0-6 h after the culprit drug intake were included. Following ENDA (European Network for Drug Allergy) inquiries. patients were evaluated with skin and/or provocation tests to define the actual drug-hypersensitive patients. Serum BT levels were determined for both patients and controls. Results: Of 345 children. 106 patients (30.7%) [(58.5% male). median age (interquartile range) 8.0 years (4.2-12.2)] were diagnosed as drug hypersensitive. Ninety-eight controls were also included. The sBT levels of drug-hypersensitive patients with and without anaphylaxis and the control group were similar [2.6 (2.0-3.6) lg/l vs. 2.8 (1.6-4.3) lg/l vs. 2.6 (1.8-3.6) lg/l. respectively. (p >0.05)]. The sBT levels of the patients with sole cutaneous symptoms 2.8 (1.6-4.3) lg/l. mild anaphylaxis 3.0 (1.9-4.9) lg/l. and moderate-to-severe anaphylaxis 2.6 (2.0-3.6) lg/l were also comparable (p >0.05). The onset of DHRs [those occurring in 1 h (n = 87) or in 1-6 h (n = 19) after the drug intake]. positive results with skin tests with the culprit drug. or the classification of the patients according to different age groups [(0-2 years). (2-6 years). (6-12 years). (12-18 years)] did not correlate with sBT levels. Conclusion: The sBT levels in children with actual drug hypersensitivity would not be a risk factor for severe systemic reactions on the contrary to children with allergic reactions to food or insect venom....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
82,BACKGROUND: Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening systemic allergic reaction. Studies suggest that the incidence of anaphylaxis is increasing; however. recent trends in emergency department (ED) visits for anaphylaxis in the United States have not been studied. OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in the incidence and rates of anaphylaxis-related ED visits from 2005 through 2014. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from a national administrative claims database including commercially insured and Medicare Advantage patients. We identified all ED visits for anaphylaxis and calculated rates as number of anaphylaxis-related ED visits per 100.000 enrollees. Rates were compared over time and by age and trigger. RESULTS: During the 10-year time period. 56.212 ED visits for anaphylaxis were identified. The median (interquartile range) age was 36 (17-52 years) years. and 58% were female. Most cases (57%) were due to unspecified triggers. 27% were associated with food. 12% were medication related. and 4% were due to insect venom. The overall rate of anaphylaxis per 100.000 enrollees increased by 101%. from 14.2 in 2005 to 28.6 in 2014 (P<.001). Rates of ED visits for anaphylaxis increased in all age groups. but the greatest increase was in children aged 5 to 17 years (196% increase; P<.001). The rate of food-related anaphylaxis increased by 124% (P<.001). and the rate of medication-related anaphylaxis increased by 212% (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: ED visits for anaphylaxis increased between 2005 and 2014. Increases in ED visits were greatest among children. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy.

83,BACKGROUND: The prescribing pattern of epinephrine over time is an indicator of the secular trend of anaphylaxis. However. it is not well known in a population level in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the trend of prescriptions for epinephrine autoinjectors in Olmsted County. Minn. residents. METHODS: Outpatient prescriptions for epinephrine were identified among residents of Olmsted County. Minn. between January 1. 2004. and December 31. 2010. We used the first prescription per patient per year. and the first prescription per patient during the study period to calculate incidence rates. Incidence rates per 100.000 person-years were calculated using patients prescribed epinephrine per year as the numerator and age-and sex-specific counts of the population of Olmsted County as the denominator. The relationships of age group. sex. and year of prescription with incidence rates were assessed by fitting Poisson regression models using the SAS procedure GENMOD. RESULTS: The overall incidence rate of epinephrine autoinjector prescriptions during the study period was 757 per 100.000 person-years (95% confidence interval: 740-774). The prescription rates per patient per year increased over time. with an annual rate of increase of 8% (P < .001). but the rates per patient remained stable (P = .077). For each year. incidence rates overall were higher in women compared with men (P < .001). From ages 0 to 19. incidence rates were higher in boys compared with girls. At age 20 and above. incidence rates were higher in women compared with men. CONCLUSIONS: The overall rate of epinephrine autoinjector prescriptions increased. but the rate of first-time prescriptions was stable from 2005 to 2010. In childhood. boys were more likely to receive a prescription than girls. but this reversed in later ages. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy.

84,Background: Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an emerging tick-borne zoonotic pathogen of increased interest worldwide which has been detected in northern Africa. Anaplasma platys is also present in this region and could possibly have a zoonotic potential. However. only one recent article reports on the human esposure to A. phagocytophilum in Morocco and no data are available on canine exposure to both bacteria. Therefore. we conducted a cross-sectional epidemiological study aiming to assess both canine and human exposure to Anaplasma spp. in Morocco. A total of 425 dogs (95 urban. 160 rural and 175 working dogs) and 11 dog owners were sampled from four cities of Morocco. Canine blood samples were screened for Anaplasma spp. antibodies by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and for A. phagocytophilum and A. platys DNA by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the msp2 gene. Human sera were tested for specific A. phagocytophilum immunoglobulin G (IgG) using a commercial immunofluorescence assay (IFA) kit. Results: Anaplasma spp. antibodies and A. platys DNA were detected in 21.9 and 7.5% of the dogs. respectively. Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA was not amplified. Anaplasma platys DNA was significantly more frequently amplified for working dogs. No statistically significant differences in the prevalence of Anaplasma spp. antibodies or A. platys DNA detection were observed between sexes. age classes or in relation to exposure to ticks. A total of 348 Rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu lato) ticks were removed from 35 urban and working dogs. The majority of dog owners (7/10) were seroreactive to A. phagoyctophilum IgG (one sample was excluded because of hemolysis). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the occurrence of Anaplasma spp. exposure and A. platys infection in dogs. and A. phagocytophilum exposure in humans in Morocco....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,HIV/AIDS
85,The lateral ponticle and epitransverse process are rare anatomical variations found on the atlas vertebra of the cervical spine. When a lateral ponticle occurs. an abnormal bony bridge extends from the superior articular facet to the transverse process. This bony bridge bisects the transverse foramen wherein the vertebral artery normally lies. In this case report. we describe a C1 specimen from an adult male with a lateral ponticle on the right side and an epitransverse process on the left side. Additionally. an articular facet-like structure was also found on the lateral ponticle's surface. Relevant literature regarding the lateral ponticle across age groups. sex. race. and species is also reviewed. We postulate that genesis of the lateral ponticle of the atlas occurs in utero. specifically during the lateral ossification of the ventral sclerotomes. To our knowledge. an articular facet-like structure on such a ponticle has not been reported previously. Moreover. simultaneous occurrence of a lateral ponticle and contralateral epitransverse process has. to our knowledge. not been reported before....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Ankylosing Spondylitis

87,Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) is a vasculitis of unknown etiology affecting predominantly small- to medium-sized vessels. usually involving the upper and lower respiratory tract and kidneys. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies are probably the initial cause of the inflammatory process that leads to the typical necrotizing lesions. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology. Szczeklik etal. [Eur. J. Immunol. 2017. 47: 724-733] report some interesting findings on the possible involvement of T-cell subsets in the pathogenesis of the disease. This prospective study. performed on a large cohort of patients. identifies Th17 lymphocytes as the possible pathogenic subset of GPA. and Treg cells as the possible suppressors of the inflammatory process. These two subsets in peripheral blood could be used as cellular biomarkers of disease activity. and this would result particularly useful in the follow-up of patients once the immunosuppressive treatment has been initiated....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Rheumatoid Arthritis
88,Purpose of Review The ANCA-associated vasculitides are a group of small vessel vasculitides characterized by autoantibodies recognizing the neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens PR3 and MPO. We examine the current clinical and molecular immunology understanding of ANCA-associated vasculitides and discuss the current needs in our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of these rare diseases. Recent Findings The majority of efforts to understand the pathogenesis of these diseases have focused on dissecting neutrophil biology because the neutrophil is the primary expressor of ANCA autoantigens. However. a number of important genetic. clinical. and cellular biology observations suggest that attempts to understand the pathogenesis of ANCA vasculitides should move away from emphasis on the role of the neutrophil and instead re-focus on the potential role of other immune cell mediators. Summary Whether or not neutrophils are the key determinant of ANCA-associated vasculitis pathogenesis should be revisited in detail. A neutrophil-centric view of the pathogenesis of these diseases cannot fully account for important genetic. clinical. and cellular biology observations that implicate important and under-appreciated roles for monocytes and T cells.

The gene encoding PdPCS1 (Pdpcs) consists of 8 exons and 7 introns and encodes a protein of 528 amino acids. PCs gene history was studied using Notung phylogeny. During evolution. gene loss from several lineages was predicted including Proteobacteria. Bilateria and Brassicaceae. In addition. eleven gene duplication events appeared toward interior nodes of the reconciled tree and four gene duplication events appeared toward the external nodes. These latter sequences belong to species with a second copy of PCs suggesting that this gene evolved through subfunctionalization Pdpcs1 gene expression was measured in seedling hypocotyls exposed to Cd. Cu and Cr using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). A Pdpcsl overexpression was evidenced in P. dactylifera seedlings exposed to metals suggesting that 1-the Pdpcsl gene is functional. 2-there is an implication of the enzyme in metal detoxification mechanisms. Additionally. the structure of PdPCS1 was predicted using its homologue from Nostoc (cyanobacterium. NsPCS) as a template in Discovery studio and PyMol software. These analyses allowed us to identify the phytochelatin synthase type I enzyme in date palm (PdPCS1) via recognition of key consensus amino acids involved in the catalytic mechanism. and to propose a hypothetical binding and catalytic site for an additional substrate binding cavity....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Genetics
90,Aim In the 19th/early 20th century. overfishing caused a drastic decline and finally extinction of the local sturgeon populations in the eastern Atlantic. To date. it is not known whether it was Acipenser sturio or the primarily North American Acipenser oxyrinchus that occurred here. The aim of the study was to show the historical pattern of sturgeon distribution and their diversity in this area over the last 2500 years. This question is essential for international restoration programmes. Location North-east Atlantic. Methods The study is based on 438 archaeological sturgeon remains from the estuaries of the rivers Rhine. Ems. Weser. Elbe and Eider. All bones were analysed morphologically and in 38 cases genetically by the amplification of two mitochondrial DNA fragments. Results The data from the bones older than 1000 years show that only 1.4% derive from A. sturio. In the south. this species was slightly more frequent. From the Elbe northwards. A. oxyrinchus was for a long time by far the dominant sturgeon species. Main conclusions The genetic identification of the oldest sturgeon bone shows A. oxyrinchus occurred in the north-eastern Atlantic already 6000 years ago. Consequently. the immigration of this species from North America to Europe occurred even earlier. potentially during the last glacial. The north-south occurrence of the two sturgeon species suggests that the distribution was the result of interspecific competition under different and changing environmental conditions. As previously published. genetic data from about 100- to 200-year-old museum specimens show strong dominance of A. sturio in the North Sea area. obviously A. oxyrinchus has been replaced in the time between 1000 and 200 years ago. Therefore. the Holocene distribution of sturgeons in the northeast Atlantic had a complex pattern. Determining the ecological bases of this distribution is important for the justification and success of restoration programmes....,biochemistry,CS,Molecular biology,Bioinformatics
91,The importance of the performance of frequency regulation has already been acknowledged by regulators and Independent System Operators (ISOs). A performance-based frequency regulation market model considering both regulation capacity and regulation mileage constraints is proposed in this paper. In the proposed market. high-performance regulation resources have higher priorities to be selected in the market. Market clearing prices are derived with Lagrange relaxation. The analysis of the components of market clearing prices accurately indicates the correlation between regulation capacity and regulation mileage. To accommodate the proposed regulation market design. AGC allocation algorithm is adjusted based on the market clearing results. The clearing procedure of the market model is demonstrated on an illustrative case. The proposed market design is tested and verified with market simulations and system dynamic simulations. Simulation results are discussed and compared to show the effectiveness of the proposed market design. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Control engineering
92,The increased penetration of renewable energy sources in existing power systems has led to necessary developments in electricity market mechanisms. Most importantly. renewable energy generation is increasingly made accountable for deviations between scheduled and actual energy generation. However. there is no mechanism to enforce accountability for the additional costs induced by power fluctuations. These costs are socialized and eventually supported by electricity customers. We propose some metrics for assessing the contribution of all market participants to power regulation needs. as well as an attribution mechanism for fairly redistributing related power regulation costs. We discuss the effect of various metrics used by the attribution mechanisms. and we illustrate. in a game-theoretical framework. their consequences on the strategic behavior of market participants. We also illustrate. by using the case of Western Denmark. how these mechanisms may affect revenues of the various market participants....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electricity
93,In ancillary service electricity markets. opportunity costs account for the profit forgone by a generator due to the use of generating capacity for ancillary service provision instead of energy sales. They are calculated for each generator providing ancillary services and are included in the determination of market-clearing prices by market operators throughout the U.S. Recent interest in the use of smart heating. ventilating. and air-conditioning systems for ancillary service provision prompts an investigation into their associated opportunity costs. This paper proposes a definition for these costs and method of accounting for them through time. This is done by recognizing the impacts intra-hour consumption modification associated with ancillary service provision have on daily energy efficiency and costs. A numeric example is presented to demonstrate the method. It is found that marginal ancillary service opportunity costs vary over time and that properly adjusting energy consumption at an hour of interest can reduce the total opportunity cost of providing ancillary services....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electricity
94,Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is characterized by deficient or absent virilization in 46.XY individuals despite normal or even elevated androgen levels. AIS is usually caused by mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. We aimed at contrasting clinical. biochemical. and molecular genetic characteristics of three patients (P1-P3) with clinically evident partial (PI) and complete (P2. P3) AIS with and without AR gene mutations. AR expression was studied in cultured genital skin fibroblasts (GSF) by Western immunoblotting. ligand binding analyses. Northern blotting. semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). and RT-PCR spanning exons 1-8. AR gene DNA sequence was analyzed by single-strand conformation analysis (SSCA). and DNA sequencing. GSF revealed reduced (P1) or absent (P2. P3) ligand binding. Northern blots showed either slightly reduced hybridization of the 10.5-kb AR transcript (P3) or no hybridization (P1. P2). as confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. RT-PCR spanning exons 1-8 detected single AR mRNA bands in P1-P3 excluding splicing errors. Western analyses showed either low (P1) or no (P2. P3) AR protein. While SSCA initially did not reveal any molecular abnormality. sequencing showed a novel CAG (Gln) to TAG (stop) mutation at codon 59 (P3) and a previously described 2-bp deletion at codon 472. leading to a frameshift and premature stop in codon 499 (P2). Intriguingly. P1 showed an unaltered DNA sequence of the coding region of the AR gene including all intronexon boundaries. In conclusion. patients with clinically evident complete AIS are likely to harbor an AR gene mutation. demanding that the two polymorphic regions must always be included in molecular analyses of the AR gene. Moreover. our data support the concept that in a subset of AIS patients. particularly those with partial AIS. molecular alterations outside the coding region of the AR gene must be presumed....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Low Testosterone
95,In this study. we attempted to explore the effect and possible mechanism of Andrographolide on OVA-induced asthma. OVA challenge induced significant airway inflammatory cell recruitment and lung histological alterations. which were ameliorated by Andrographolide. The protein levels of cytokines in bron-choalveolar fluid (BALF) and serum were reduced by Andrographolide administration as well as the mRNA levels in lung tissue. Mechanically. Andrographolide markedly hampered the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and NLRP3 inflammasome both in vivo and vitro thus decreased levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. Finally. we confirmed that ROS scavenging was responsible for Andrographolide's inactivation of NF-kappa B and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling. Our study here revealed the effect and possible mechanism of Andrographolide on asthma. which may represent a new therapeutic approach for treating this disease....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Mental Health
96,Introduction: Therapeutic options for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are limited to hypomethylating agents (HMA) and lenalidomide. Rigosertib. a small molecule which blocks RAS-mediated activation of proteins containing a common RAS binding domain. appears to be a promising novel drug.Areas covered: Discovery. mechanism of action of rigosertib. and results of clinical trials are described. More than 500 patients have been treated and the safety. pharmacokinetics. and efficacy of rigosertib are summarized. These studies are placed in the context of the history of therapeutic development in MDS and the promise of new. tailored treatments based on emerging knowledge of the heterogeneity and molecular biology of the disease.Expert opinion: In summary. the Phase III study failed to meet the primary endpoint but clearly showed significant improvement in survival in a subset of very high risk MDS patients who were primary HMA failures. A new Phase III trial designed to validate these findings is now ongoing. Oral rigosertib. in a Phase II trial. produced transfusion independence in similar to 35% patients with lower risk MDS with or without recombinant erythropoietin. A methylation based signature appears to distinguish between the two groups. Validation of these early encouraging observations through future clinical trials is eagerly anticipated....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
97,Background Most data on chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) originate from highly selected patient populations treated at specialized centres. Little is known about CSU patient characteristics and the burden of CSU in routine clinical practice. AWARE (A World-wide Antihistamine-Refractory chronic urticaria patient Evaluation) is an ongoing global study designed to assess chronic urticaria in the real-life setting. Objective To describe the baseline characteristics of the first 1539 German AWARE patients with H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU. Methods This prospective non-interventional study included patients (18-75 years) with a diagnosis of H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU for >2 months. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics. comorbidities. and pharmacological treatments were recorded. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the dermatology life quality index (DLQI). chronic urticaria QoL questionnaire (CU-Q(2)oL). and angioedema QoL questionnaire (AE-QoL. in cases of angioedema). Previous healthcare resource utilization and sick leave data were collected retrospectively. Results Between March and December 2014. 1539 patients were assessed in 256 sites across Germany. The percentage of females. mean age. and mean body mass index were 70%. 46.3 years. and 27 kg/m(2). respectively. The mean urticaria control test score was 7.9. one in two patients had angioedema. and the most frequent comorbidities were chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU; 24%). allergic rhinitis (18.2%). hypertension (18.1%). asthma (12%). and depression (9.5%). Overall. 57.6% of patients were receiving at least one pharmacological treatment including second-generation H1-antihistamines (46.3%). first-generation H1-antihistamines (9.1%). and corticosteroids (15.8%). The mean DLQI. total CU-Q(2)oL. and total AE-QoL scores were 8.3. 36.2. and 46.8. respectively. CSU patients reported frequent use of healthcare resources. including emergency services (29.7%). general practitioners (71.9%). and additional allergists or dermatologists (50.7%). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance This study reveals that German H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU patients have high rates of uncontrolled disease. angioedema. and comorbid CIndU. are undertreated. have impaired QoL. and rely heavily on healthcare resources....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Allergies
98,AimsThymomas and thymic squamous cell carcinomas (TSQCCs) are rare thymic epithelial tumours. Data on angiogenesis and vascular phenotype in these tumours are limited. and no study has taken histological World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes into account. The aim of this study was to compare vascularization. pericytes coverage and expression of angiogenic growth factors in different WHO-defined subtypes of thymoma Methods and resultsVascular density. diameter and architecture and expression of -smooth muscle actin (SMA). platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor- (PDGFR). vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) were investigated in WHO type A. AB. B1. B2 and B3 thymomas and TSQCCs. by the use of immunostaining. quantitative morphometry. and tumour vessel isolation by trypsin digestion. Expression levels of angiopoietin 1 (Ang-1). angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2). VEGF-A. PDGF-B and Hif-1 were examined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A and AB thymomas were characterized by a dense network of capillary-like vessels with tight pericyte coverage. whereas B thymomas showed a loose vascular network with increasing vascular diameters and increasing expression of SMA and PDGFR from B1 to B3 thymomas and TSQCCs. VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 were expressed in vessels of all analysed tumour entities. and at higher levels in epithelial cells of A and B3 thymomas and TSQCCs. mRNA of Ang-2. but not of Ang-1. was significantly up-regulated in all thymoma subtypes. with the highest levels being found in A thymomas. In TSQCCs. Ang-1 and VEGF were the predominantly up-regulated growth factors. Hif-1 was only up-regulated in B3 thymomas and TSQCCs. ConclusionThymomas and TSQCCs differ significantly in their vascular architecture and expression of key angiogenic growth factors. The findings could help to improve the differential diagnosis of difficult-to-classify thymic epithelial tumours. and indicate different mechanisms of tumour angiogenesis and functional differences of tumour vessels of major thymoma subtypes and TSQCCs....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
99,Objective: To determine if the molecular profiles of endometriotic lesions contain informative measures of inflammation and immune dysfunction that may contribute to better understanding of the interplay between immune dysfunction and inflammation and their contribution to endometriosis pathogenesis. Design: Immune and inflammation transcriptomic analysis with the use of the Nanostring nCounter GX Human Immunology V2 platform (579 human immune and inflammation-related genes and 15 housekeeping genes). Setting: Academic university and teaching hospital. Intervention(s): None. Patient(s): Stage III-IV endometriosis patients with infertility (n = 8) and fertile disease-free control women undergoing tubal ligation (n = 8). Menstrual stage was matched to secretory phase in all participants. Main Outcome Measure(s): Immune and inflammation transcriptomics quantification from ectopic endometriotic lesions and matched eutopic endometrium from patients. Endometria of fertile women served as control subjects. Result(s): Our results displayed endometriotic lesions as molecularly distinct entities compared with eutopic endometrium and endometrium of control samples; 396 out of 579 screened immune and inflammation-related genes were significantly different in ectopic tissues compared with control endometrium. Most importantly. eutopic endometrium of the patients displayed a unique molecular profile compared with the control endometrium (91/579 genes were significantly different). particularly of genes involved in regulation of cell apoptosis and decidualization. Conclusion(s): We characterize differential expression of immune-inflammation genes in endometriosis patients. and show molecular distinction of eutopic endometrium of patients compared with control fertile women.

0,Fish protein hydrolysate was prepared from muscle of small red scorpionfish (Scorpaena notata) by treatment with a protease from the fungus Penicillium digitatum. Protein hydrolysate was found to strongly inhibit the angiotensin I converting enzyme and exhibited high antioxidative activity through 1.1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging assay. After ultrafiltration. peptides were isolated by a two-step procedure: size exclusion chromatography on a Toyopearl HW-40 followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with a high purification yield of 2.5 mg of peptide per gram of initial protein. Two major peptides were then identified by nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS). corresponding to the following sequences: Leu-Val-Thr-Gly-Asp-Asp-Lys-Thr-Asn-Leu-Lys (1.204.665 Da) and Asp-Thr-Gly-Ser-Asp-Lys-Lys-Gln-Leu (992.511 Da). These peptides. mainly composed of hydrophilic amino acids. showed high antioxidative and angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory activities. These data suggest that the two novel peptides isolated from the muscle hydrolysate of small red scorpionfish can be a beneficial ingredient for functional foods or pharmaceuticals against hypertension and oxidative stress.

1,Ca2+-activated Cl-channels play a crucial role in various physiological processes. However. the role of TMEM16A in vascular endothelial dysfunction during hypertension is unclear. In this study. we investigated the specific involvement of TMEM16A in regulating endothelial function and blood pressure and the underlying mechanism. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Western blotting. coimmunoprecipitation. confocal imaging. patch-clamp recordings. and TMEM16A endothelial-specific transgenic and knockout mice were used. We found that TMEM16A was expressed abundantly and functioned as a Ca2+-activated Cl-channel in endothelial cells. Angiotensin II induced endothelial dysfunction with an increase in TMEM16A expression. The knockout of endothelial-specific TMEM16A significantly lowered the blood pressure and ameliorated endothelial dysfunction in angiotensin II-induced hypertension. whereas the overexpression of endothelial-specific TMEM16A resulted in the opposite effects. These results were related to the increased reactive oxygen species production. Nox2-containing NADPH oxidase activation. and Nox2 and p22phox protein expression that were facilitated by TMEM16A on angiotensin II-induced hypertensive challenge. Moreover. TMEM16A directly bound with Nox2 and reduced the degradation of Nox2 through the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. Therefore. TMEM16A is a positive regulator of endothelial reactive oxygen species generation via Nox2-containing NADPH oxidase. which induces endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. Modification of TMEM16A may be a novel therapeutic strategy for endothelial dysfunction-associated diseases....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Heart Disease
2,1. Angiotensin (Ang) II plays a major role in vascular remodelling. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) are involved in the tissue remodelling processes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether AngII modulates TIMP-2 expression in rat aortic smooth muscle cells in vivo. 2. Angiotensin II (200 ng/kg per min. s.c.) or AngII + losartan (10 mg/kg per day. s.c.) or normal saline was administered continuously by osmotic minipumps to Sprague-Dawley rats for 1 week. In addition. the effect of endogenous AngII on TIMP-2 expression was evaluated in renovascular hypertensive rats (two kidney. one clip (2K1C) and one kidney. one clip (1K1C) models). Control rats (sham 2K1C and sham 1K1C rats) underwent sham-clipping of the left renal artery. At the end of the treatment. plasma renin activity was measured by radioimmunoassay. aortic TIMP-2 mRNA expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and/or northern blotting and protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured twice a week by the tail-cuff method. 3. Exogenous AngII administration produced the expected increase in SBP (P = 0.02) compared with the control saline-treated group. The increase in SBP was abolished in AngII + losartan-treated rats. Administration of AngII caused a significant increase in TIMP-2 expression (P = 0.01) in rat aortic smooth muscle cells that was abolished in AngII + losartan-treated rats. In renovascular hypertensive rats. SBP was higher (P < 0.0001) in 2K1C and 1K1C rats compared with the corresponding sham-operated rats. Plasma renin activity was higher (P < 0.01) in 2K1C rats compared with the other groups. The expression of TIMP-2 was significantly (P < 0.05) increased only in 2K1C rats. 4. Our in vivo data demonstrate that exogenous and endogenous AngII increases TIMP-2 expression in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. This effect is not dependent on the AngII-induced increase in blood pressure and is mediated by angiotensin AT(1) receptors....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Heart Disease
3,Angiotensin II is critical in pre-eclampsia pathogenesis. In addition. microRNA-155 regulates angiotensin II type I receptor expression. We have explored the function of microRNA-155 in pre-eclamptic pregnant women. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were isolated and cultured from healthy puerperant women and pre-eclampsia patients. The cells were transfected with a mature microRNA-155 plasmid. The effect of microRNA-155 was assessed by Northern blotting. in situ hybridization. quantitative real-time PCR. immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. In addition. activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Severely pre-eclamptic pregnant women expressed less mature miR-155 compared to healthy pregnant women. In addition. angiotensin H type 1 receptor expression decreased substantially in healthy cells and miR-155-transfected cells compared to miR-155-mutant-transfected cells and cells from pre-eclamptic patients. Mature miR-155 reduced angiotensin II-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation. In conclusion. endogenous mature miR-155 expression may be an important contributor to the pathogenesis of severe pre-eclampsia....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Heart Disease
4,Renin substrate. biological renin activity. and/or renin-secreting cells in kidneys evolved at an early stage of vertebrate phylogeny. Angiotensin (Ang) I and II molecules have been identified biochemically in representative species of all vertebrate classes. although variation occurs in amino acids at positions 1. 5. and 9 of Ang I. Variations have also evolved in amino acid positions 3 and 4 in some cartilaginous fish. Angiotensin receptors. AT(1) and AT(2) homologues. have been identified molecularly or characterized pharmacologically in nonmammalian vertebrates. Also. various forms of angiotensins that bypass the traditional renin-angiotensin system (RAS) cascades or those from large peptide substrates. particularly in tissues. are present. Nonetheless. the phylogenetically important functions of RAS are to maintain blood pressure/blood volume homeostasis and ion-fluid balance via the kidney and central mechanisms. Stimulation of cell growth and vascularization. possibly via paracrine action of angiotensins. and the molecular biology of RAS and its receptors have been intensive research foci. This review provides an overview of: (1) the phylogenetic appearance. structure. and biochemistry of the RAS cascade; (2) the properties of angiotensin receptors from comparative viewpoints; and (3) the functions and regulation of the RAS in nonmammalian vertebrates. Discussions focus on the most fundamental functions of the RAS that have been conserved throughout phylogenetic advancement. as well as on their physiological implications and significance. Examining the biological history of RAS will help us analyze the complex RAS systems of mammals. Furthermore. suitable models for answering specific questions are often found in more primitive animals....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Cell biology
5,1. Several eel species have undergone extensive declines at both local and global level. The aim of this study was to identify the reasons for the collapse of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) stock in an important area for biodiversity conservation (Comacchio Lagoon. Italy). in order to support the development of eel conservation plans. 2. The records of silver eel catches from Comacchio describe the total migratory population and cover the period 1781- 2013. The data are accompanied by information related to habitat loss and other local factors. The role of local factors on the decline of the local stock was investigated. while additional information from the literature was also used to discuss the effects of global factors (including glass eel harvest for aquaculture. climateoceanographic changes. habitat loss. pollution and parasitism) on the three eel species A. anguilla. Anguilla japonica and Anguilla rostrata. 3. The records from Comacchio provided significant information about the effects of local factors on the local eel populations in the past. However. the current population collapse. which started in the 1970s. could not be explained by local factors. 4. The literature on global factors suggests that the three eel species are under combined threat from various factors. The correlations between European aquaculture production data compared with the Comacchio yields and published data from other European eel and glass eel fisheries were found to be highly significant. Aquaculture. which depends entirely on wild- caught glass eels. seems to play a key role in the decline of natural stocks. 5. Conservative estimates using FAO data showed that the current numbers of glass eels needed to support aquaculture production in Europe and Asia exceeds 2 x 109 specimens. This requirement. largely supplied by A. anguilla glass eels. can explain the decline of eel populations since the glass eel trade has been expanded at an international level.

6,Even simple geometric shapes are seen as animate and goal-directed when they move in certain ways. Previous research has revealed a great deal about the cues that elicit such percepts. but much less about the consequences for other aspects of perception and cognition. Here we explored whether simple shapes that are perceived as animate and goal-directed are prioritized in memory. We investigated this by asking whether subjects better remember the locations of displays that are seen as animate vs. inanimate. controlling for lower-level factors. We exploited the 'Wolfpack effect': moving darts (or discs with 'eyes') that stay oriented toward a particular target are seen to be actively pursuing that target. even when they actually move randomly. (In contrast. shapes that stay oriented perpendicular to a target are correctly perceived to be drifting randomly.) Subjects played a 'matching game' - clicking on pairs of panels to reveal animations with moving shapes. Across four experiments. the locations of Wolfpack animations (compared to control animations equated on lower-level visual factors) were better remembered. in terms of more efficient matching. Thus perceiving animacy influences subsequent visual memory. perhaps due to the adaptive significance of such stimuli. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately. due to many controversies. the findings of these studies frequently have been dismissed or outright ignored. However. experimental exploration of the capacities of nonhumans is the only option to determine which. if any. language-associated capacities are unique to humans. Researchers continue to publish findings from language projects that move our understanding forward. including descriptions of capacities. such as gestural comprehension. declarative communication. and categorization. that are frequently considered to be specific biological adaptations....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Nonverbal communication
8,Social network analysis has become a prominent tool to study animal social life. and there is an increasing need to develop new systems to collect social information automatically. systematically. and reliably. Here we explore the use of a freely accessible Automated Learning Device for Monkeys (ALDM) to collect such social information on a group of 22 captive baboons (Papio papio). We compared the social network obtained from the co-presence of the baboons in ten ALDM testing booths to the social network obtained through standard behavioral observation techniques. The results show that the co-presence network accurately reflects the social organization of the group. and also indicate under which conditions the co-presence network is most informative. In particular. the best correlation between the two networks was obtained with a minimum of 40 days of computer records and for individuals with at least 500 records per day. We also show through random permutation tests that the observed correlations go beyond what would be observed by simple synchronous activity. to reflect a preferential choice of closely located testing booths. The use of automatized cognitive testing therefore presents a new way of obtaining a large and regular amount of social information that is necessary to develop social network analysis. It also opens the possibility of studying dynamic changes in network structure with time and in relation to the cognitive performance of individuals....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
9,In the horse. breeding induces a transient endometrial inflammation. A subset of mares are unable to resolve this inflammation. and they are considered susceptible to persistent mating-induced endometritis PMIE Select seminal plasma proteins cysteine-rich secretory protein-3 (CRISP-3) and lactoferrin have been shown to affect the innate immune response to sperm in vitro. The objective of this study was to determine whether the addition of CRISP-3 and lactoferrin at the time of insemination had an effect on the mRNA expression of endometrial cytokines in susceptible mares after breeding. Six mares classified as susceptible to PMIE were inseminated during four consecutive oestrous cycles with treatments in randomized order of: 1 mg/ ml CRISP-3. 150 mu g/ ml lactoferrin. seminal plasma (positive control) or lactated Ringer's solution (LRS; negative control) to a total volume of 10 ml combined with 1 x 10(9) spermatozoa pooled from two stallions. Six hours after treatment. an endometrial biopsy was obtained for qPCR analysis of selected genes associated with inflammation (pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)- 1 beta. IL- 8. tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha. interferon (INF)-gamma. anti-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1RN and IL- 10. and inflammatory- modulating cytokine IL- 6). Seminal plasma treatment increased the mRNA expression of IL- 1 beta (p =.019) and IL- 8 (p =.0068). while suppressing the mRNA expression of TNF (p =.0013). Lactoferrin also suppressed the mRNA expression of TNF (p =.0013). In conclusion. exogenous lactoferrin may be considered as one modulator of the complex series of events resulting in the poorly regulated pro-inflammatory response seen in susceptible mares....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Menopause
10,Existing research suggests that various forms of family violence such as domestic violence and child abuse tend to coexist or cluster. Although the link between animal cruelty and domestic violence is well publicized. little research has examined various forms of animal abuse and possible links between corresponding forms of interpersonal offenses. The present study examined a subsample obtained from the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit. (BAU) III - Crimes Against Children. which included the criminal histories of 150 adult males arrested for animal cruelty. neglect or sexual abuse in the. U.S. between 2004 and 2009. The sample was described in terms of demographic and criminal characteristics. Results indicated that 41% of the offenders in the sample were arrested for interpersonal violence at least once. 18% were arrested for a sex offense such as rape or child molestation. and 28% were arrested for another interpersonal crime such as violating a restraining order or harassment. Significant relationships were discovered between Active animal cruelty (such as beating or stabbing) and both interpersonal violence and substance abuse as well as between sexually abusing animals and sexual offending against humans. These results point to the need for increased collaboration between animal welfare agencies and the social service and legal entities responsible for protecting domestic violence victims. children. elders. and others at risk groups.

11,This review presents an overview of some of the pre-clinical and clinical issues that have contributed to the failures of potential novel neuropsychiatric drugs. which have prompted a re-examination of the role of animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders. Advances both in basic neuroscience and technology have driven the development of animal models of aspects of neuropsychiatric disorders. Genetics and environmental factors have been the primary contributors to the development of new animal models. Neuroimaging has contributed to the search for biomarkers by which neuropsychiatric disorders may be identified and differentiated. its progression monitored and that the effects of therapy assessed. Parallel to these theoretical and practical advancements have been the changes in the diagnosis and classification of neuropsychiatric disorders from DSM-4 to DSM-5. and emergence of the NIH initiatives such as MATRICS; CNTRICS and RDoC. These latter changes are shifting our concepts of neuropsychiatric disorders away from phenomenology to their biology and thus aligning physiology with psychology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

12,We tested the two main evolutionary hypotheses for an association between immunity and personality. The risk of-parasitism hypothesis predicts that more proactive (bold. exploratory. risk-taking) individuals have more vigorous immune defenses because of increased risk of parasite exposure. In contrast. the pace-of-life hypothesis argues that proactive behavioral styles are associated with shorter lifespans and reduced investment in immune function. Mechanistically. associations between immunity and personality can arise because personality differences are often associated with differences in condition and stress responsiveness. both of which are intricately linked with immunity. Here we investigate the association between personality (measured as proactive exploration of a novel environment) and three indices of innate immune function (the non-specific first line of defense against parasites) in wild superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus. We also quantified body condition. hemoparasites (none detected). chronic stress (heterophil:lymphocyte ratio) and circulating corticosterone levels at the end of the behavioral test (CORT. in a subset of birds). We found that fast explorers had lower titers of natural antibodies. This result is consistent with the pace-of-life hypothesis. and with the previously documented higher mortality of fast explorers in this species. There was no interactive effect of exploration score and duration in captivity on immune indices. This suggests that personality-related differences in stress responsiveness did not underlie differences in immunity. even though behavioral style did modulate the effect of captivity on CORT. Taken together these results suggest reduced constitutive investment in innate immune function in more proactive individuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

13,Mild therapeutic hypothermia is a candidate for the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However. the role of mild hypothermia in neuronal sprouting after TBI remains obscure. We used a fluid percussion injury (FPI) model to assess the effect of mild hypothermia on pericontusion neuronal sprouting after TBI in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent FPI or sham surgery. followed by mild hypothermia treatment (33 degrees C) or normothermia treatment (37 degrees C) for 3 h. All the rats were euthanized at 7 days after FPI. Neuronal sprouting that was confirmed by an increase in growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) expression was evaluated using immunofluorescence and Western blot assays. The expression levels of several intrinsic and extrinsic sprouting-associated genes such as neurite outgrowth inhibitor A (NogoA). phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Our results revealed that mild hypothermia significantly increased the expression level of GAP-43 and dramatically suppressed the expression level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and SOCS3 at 7 days after FPI in the ipsilateral cortex compared with that of the normothermia TBI group. These data suggest that post-traumatic mild hypothermia promotes pericontusion neuronal sprouting after TBI. Moreover. the mechanism of hypothermia-induced neuronal sprouting might be partially associated with decreased levels of SOCS3....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Sports Injuries
14,OBJECTIVE: We investigated the expression of annexin A5 (ANXA5) in human cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cell line and its effect on proliferation. migration. and apoptosis of human CCA cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of ANXA5 was detected by fluorescent quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting method in 2 human CCA cell lines. QBC939 and RBE. 3 shRNA plasmids for ANXA5 silencing (ANXA5-sh1. ANXA5-sh2. ANXA5-sh3) and 1 negative control plasmid were constructed to infect QBC939 cells. The infection efficiency. expression of ANXA5. apoptosis and cell cycle of QBC939 cell were measured separately. RESULTS: The expression of ANXA5 in QBC939 cell was significantly higher than RBE cell. Expressed ANXA5 protein in the QBC939-KD cell (QBC939 cell treated by RNAi) was significantly lower than QBC939-BC (QBC939 cell) and QBC939-NC cells (QBC939 cell treated by scramble plasmid). The ratio of G0/1 phase cells and apoptosis rate increased in QBC939-KD cell. The proliferation activity and invasion ability decreased in QBC939-KD cell compared with QBC939-NC and QBC939-BC cells. CONCLUSIONS: ANXA5 play important role in the migration and apoptosis of CCA cells. Inhibiting the expression of ANXA5 significantly reduce the proliferation. migration and invasion ability of QBC939 cells. and increase the apoptosis of QBC939 cells....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
15,The tumor suppressor p16INK4a has functions beyond cell-cycle control via cyclin-dependent kinases. A coordinated remodeling of N- and O-glycosylation. and an increase in the presentation of the endogenous lectin galectin-1 sensing these changes on the surface of p16INK4a-expressing pancreatic carcinoma cells (Capan-1). lead to potent pro-anoikis signals. We show that the p16INK4a-dependent impact on growth-regulatory lectins is not limited to galectin-1. but also concerns galectin-3. By monitoring its expression in relation to p16INK4a status. as well as running anoikis assays with galectin-3 and cell transfectants with up- or downregulated lectin expression. a negative correlation between anoikis and the presence of this lectin was established. Nuclear run-off and northern blotting experiments revealed an effect of the presence of p16INK4a on steady-state levels of galectin-3-specific mRNA that differed from decreasing the transcriptional rate. On the cell surface. galectin-3 interferes with galectin-1. which initiates signaling toward its pro-anoikis activity via caspase-8 activation. The detected opposite effects of p16INK4a at the levels of growth-regulatory galectins-1 and -3 shift the status markedly towards the galectin-1-dependent pro-anoikis activity. A previously undescribed orchestrated fine-tuning of this effector system by a tumor suppressor is discovered....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Cancer
16,BACKGROUND: Little is known about anorectal function and quality of life after chemoradiation followed by local excision. which is an alternative to total mesorectal excision for selected patients with early rectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess anorectal function and health-related quality of life of patients with T2N0 rectal cancer who were treated with an alternative approach. DESIGN: This was a prospective. phase II trial. SETTINGS: The study was multicentric (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group trial Z6041). INTERVENTIONS: Patients with stage cT2N0 rectal adenocarcinomas were treated with an oxaliplatin/capecitabine-based chemoradiation regimen followed by local excision. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anorectal function and quality of life were assessed at enrollment and 1 year postoperatively with the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index. Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life scale. and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal Questionnaire. Results were compared. and multivariable analysis was performed to identify predictors of outcome. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients (98%) were evaluated at enrollment and 66 (92%) at 1 year. Compared with baseline. no significant differences were found on Fecal Incontinence Severity Index scores at 1 year. Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life results were significantly worse in the lifestyle (p < 0.001). coping/behavior (p < 0.001). and embarrassment (p = 0.002) domains. There were no differences in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy overall score. but the physical wellbeing subscale was significantly worse and emotional well-being was improved after surgery. Treatment with the original chemoradiation regimen predicted worse depression/self-perception and embarrassment scores in the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life. and male sex was predictive of worse scores in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy overall score and trial outcome index. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size. relatively short follow-up. and absence of information before cancer diagnosis were study limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Chemoradiation followed by local excision had minimal impact on anorectal function 1 year after surgery. Overall quality of life remained stable. with mixed effects on different subscales. This information should be used to counsel patients about expected outcomes....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Cancer
17,Numerous patients with anorectal malformations (ARMs) continue to experience fecal incontinence and constipation following surgical procedures. One of the most important factors that influences defecation is the striated muscle complex (SMC). Wnt signaling regulates the expression of myogenic regulatory factors. which serve an important role in muscle development. Therefore. the present study aimed to investigate the expression pattern of Wnt3a protein (by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis) and mRNA [by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)] in the SMC of ARM model rats that were exposed to ethylenethiourea. Immunostaining revealed that the expression of Wnt3a exhibits space-and time-dependent changes in the developing SMC of ARM model rat embryos. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that on embryonic day 17 (E17). Wnt3a-positive cells were observed in the SMC in normal embryos. and expression levels gradually increased as the rat embryos developed. Similar changes in Wnt3a protein expression were detected in ARM model rat embryos; however. the expression of Wnt3a was significantly reduced compared with the normal rat embryos. Western blotting and RT-qPCR also revealed lower expression levels of Wnt3a protein and mRNA. respectively. in the SMC of ARMs model rat embryos compared with normal rat embryos. These data revealed that the expression of Wnt3a in ARM embryos was notably reduced. indicating a potential role for Wnt3a in the maldevelopment of the SMC in patients with ARMs....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Irritable Bowel Syndrome
18,Purpose: A subgroup of individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) displays social difficulties; however. it is not clear if individuals with comorbid autism spectrum disorders account for these difficulties. Methods: We compared social function using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule in 43 young females with first-episode AN who did not have comorbid autism spectrum disorder. 28 individuals recovered from adolescent-onset AN. and 41 healthy comparison individuals (age range 14-22 years). We measured adaptive behavior with the Vineland-II parent questionnaire. and aspects of social cognition with psychological tests. such as the Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes test. Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity short version. The Awareness of Social Inference Test. Animated Triangles. and the CANTAB Affective Go/No-go task. Results: Participants with first-episode AN and those recovered from AN displayed difficulties in social function. which were not associated with body mass index or other state factors of the disorder in those with first-episode AN. Mood problems and anxiety were not associated with these difficulties. Parents rated participants with first-episode AN lower than recovered and control participants on the Socialization Domain of Vineland-II. Finally. only participants recovered from AN demonstrated deficits in specific domains of social cognition: perceiving nonverbal bodily gesture and vocal prosody. Conclusions: Young females with first-episode AN and those recovered from AN displayed impairments in social function. which may represent more stable traits of the disorder. Only participants recovered from AN demonstrated deficits in social cognition. (C) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Autism
19,This study examines whether the perception of peripersonal action-space and interpersonal social-space is modified in patients with restrictive-type anorexia in two experimental conditions using videos. First. participants stopped the video of an approaching stimulus when they felt the distance to be comfortable for interacting with it (first-person perspective). Second. participants stopped the video when an observed individual approaching a stimulus. or being approached by it. was at a comfortable distance (third-person perspective). In the first-person perspective. the results showed an estimation of peripersonal space that did not differ from controls when an object was approaching and an increase in interpersonal space compared with controls when a male or female individual was approaching. In the third-person perspective. both individual-object and individual-individual distances were larger in anorexic patients. These results indicate a specific deficit in adjusting interpersonal distances in both the first-person and third-person perspectives. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons.

20,We tested wild birds in Poland during 2008-15 for avian influenza virus (AIV). We took 10.312 swabs and feces samples from 6.314 live birds representing 12 orders and 84 bird species. mostly from orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. for testing and characterization by various PCR methods. From PCR-positive samples. we attempted to isolate and subtype the virus. The RNA of AIV was detected in 1.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]. 1.5-2.1%) of birds represented by 48 Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). 11 Mute Swans (Cygnus olor). 48 Common Teals (Anas crecca). three Black-headed Gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus). one Common Coot (Fulica atra). one Garganey (Spatula querquedula). and one unidentified bird species. Overall. the prevalence of AIV detection in Mallards and Mute Swans (the most frequently sampled species) was 2.0% (95% CI. 1.4-2.5%) and 0.5% (95% CI. 0.2-0.8%). respectively; the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.000). Hemagglutinin subtypes from H1 to H13 were identified. including H5 and H7 low pathogenic AIV subtypes. Mallards and Common Teals harbored the greatest diversity of subtypes. We observed seasonality of viral detection in Mallards. with higher AIV prevalence in late summer and autumn than in winter and spring. In addition. two peaks in AIV prevalence in summer (August) and autumn (November) were demonstrated for Mallards. The prevalence of AIV in Mute Swans did not show any statistically significant seasonal patterns....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,HIV/AIDS
21,Background: Glutamatergic system abnormalities are implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of both major depressive disorder and bipolar depression (BDep). Subsequent to studies demonstrating the rapid and robust antidepressant effects of ketamine. an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist. other glutamatergic modulators are now being studied in clinical trials of mood disorders. A previous open-label study found that riluzole. administered in combination with the mood stabilizer lithium. had antidepressant effects. Methods: We conducted a randomized. double-blind. placebo-controlled trial of riluzole monotherapy for the treatment of BDep. Nineteen subjects aged 18 to 70 years with bipolar disorder currently experiencing a depressive episode were tapered off of excluded medications and randomized to receive riluzole (50-200 mg/d) or placebo for 8 weeks. Rating scale scores (Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety. and Young Mania Rating Scale) were obtained weekly. Results: No significant differences in depressive symptoms were observed between subjects treated with riluzole and those receiving placebo (P = 0.12). Anxiety scores were significantly lower in the placebo group (P = 0.046). An interim analysis was conducted that resulted in stopping the study because of futility; no subjects had achieved treatment response. Conclusions: Although we found no change in severity of depressive symptoms in BDep patients receiving riluzole compared with placebo. this trial was limited by the relatively high number of subject withdrawals and the small sample size. Thus. while riluzole monotherapy did not demonstrate efficacy for BDep. further studies examining riluzole as adjunctive therapy for this disorder may be warranted....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Depression
22,A system of generating tunable orbital angular momentum (OAM) radio beams and a method of measuring the OAM states are proposed and experimentally investigated. The OAM beams. which are generated by a uniform circular array. can be dynamically configured by controlling the digital signals in the baseband. A 2-D near-field scanning platform is built to measure the OAM states of the system. The platform can provide multiple feed ports for the transmitting array. Iteration is used to calibrate the amplitude and phase of each feed port. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methods on generating and measuring tunable OAM beams....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Satellite radio
23,Cortical networks underpinning attentional control and mentalizing converge at the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). It is debated whether the rTPJ is fractionated in neighboring. but separate functional modules underpinning attentional control and mentalizing. or whether one overarching cognitive mechanism explains the rTPJ's role in both domains. Addressing this question. we combined attentional control and mentalizing in a factorial design within one task. We added a social context condition. in which another individual's mental states became apparently task-relevant. to a spatial cueing paradigm. This allowed for assessing cue validity-and context-dependent functional activity and effective connectivity of the rTPJ within corresponding cortical networks. We found two discriminable rTPJ subregions. an anterior and a posterior one. Yet. we did not observe a sharp functional dissociation between these two. as both regions responded to attention cueing and social context manipulation. The results suggest that the rTPJ is part of both the ventral attention and the ToM network and that its function is defined by context-dependent coupling with the respective network. We argue that the rTPJ as a functional unit underpins an overarching cognitive mechanism in attentional control and mentalizing and discuss how the present results help to further specify this mechanism....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
24,Purpose: To Compare tendon-to-bone healing in remnant-preserving and conventional anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Methods: 72 New Zealand rabbits were randomly assigned to conventional ACL reconstruction group (group A). remnant-preserving and tensioning ACL reconstruction group (group B). and remnant-preserving and graft through remnant sleeve ACL reconstruction group (group C). with 24 rabbits (48 knees) in each group. The incidence and degree of bone tunnel enlargement in each group were analyzed using CT 3D reconstruction. Graft tendon-bone healing was monitored by HE and Masson staining. and osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) mRNA expression in the bone tissue surrounding the graft. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to evaluate the ratio of OPG/RANKL expression. Results: Histological analysis showed that group C had the best graft tendon-bone healing. followed by group B and group A at all time-points post-surgery. At weeks 3 and 6 post-surgery. OPG mRNA levels and OPG/RANKL values were higher in groups B and C compared to group A (P < 0.05). RANKL mRNA levels of groups B and C were lower than group A (P0.05). At 3 weeks post-surgery. the incidence and degree of bone tunnel enlargement were greater in group A compared to groups B and C (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Both remnant-preserving construction approaches promoted graft tendon-bone healing. the underlying mechanism may be associated with the upregulation of OPG mRNA and downregulation of RANKL mRNA in bone tunnel early post-operation....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Osteoarthritis
25,Words activate cortical regions in accordance with their modality of presentation (i.e.. written vs. spoken). yet there is a long-standing debate about whether patterns of activity in any specific brain region capture modality invariant conceptual information. Deficits in patients with semantic dementia highlight the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) as an amodal store of semantic knowledge but these studies do not permit precise localisation of this function. The current investigation used multiple imaging methods in healthy participants to examine functional dissociations within ATL. Multi-voxel pattern analysis identified spatially segregated regions: a response to input modality in anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG) and a response to meaning in more ventral anterior temporal lobe (vATL). This functional dissociation was supported by resting-state connectivity that found greater coupling for aSTG with primary auditory cortex and vATL with the default mode network. A meta-analytic decoding of these connectivity patterns implicated aSTG in processes closely tied to auditory processing (such as phonology and language) and vATL in meaning-based tasks (such as comprehension or social cognition). Thus we provide converging evidence for the segregation of meaning and input modality in the ATL....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Attention
26,Humans cannot help but attribute human emotions to non-human animals. Although such attributions are often regarded as gratuitous anthropomorphisms and held apart from the attributions humans make about each other's internal states. they may be the product of a general mechanism for flexibly interpreting adaptive behavior. To examine this. we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to compare the neural mechanisms associated with attributing emotions to humans and non-human animal behavior. Although undergoing fMRI. participants first passively observed the facial displays of human. non-human primate and domestic dogs. and subsequently judged the acceptability of emotional (e.g. 'annoyed') and facial descriptions (e.g. 'baring teeth') for the same images. For all targets. emotion attributions selectively activated regions in prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices associated with causal explanation in prior studies. These regions were similarly activated by both human and non-human targets even during the passive observation task; moreover. the degree of neural similarity was dependent on participants' self-reported beliefs in the mental capacities of non-human animals. These results encourage a non-anthropocentric view of emotion understanding. one that treats the idea that animals have emotions as no more gratuitous than the idea that humans other than ourselves do....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
27,Introduction: C1q play an important role in clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cell debris. Impaired clearance leads to exposure of C1 native antigen and development of anti-C1q antibody formation. Anti-C1q antibody is well studied in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Significance of anti-C1q Ab in Indian SLE patients and their clinical manifestations is not clear. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate associations between anti-C1q antibody and clinical as well as serological markers of SLE. Materials and Methods: Retrospective study of SLE patients fulfilling either American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 or Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) 2012 classification criteria were recruited from inpatients and outpatients services of the Clinical immunology and Rheumatology Department. Christian Medical College at Vellore. India between March 2013 and January 2015. Anti-C1q antibody was assayed by ELISA (Demeditec Diagnostics GmbH. Germany). Logistic regression analysis was performed to find the association of anti-C1q antibodies with serological and clinical parameters in SLE including Lupus Nephritis (LN). Results: Sixty nine patients (54.76%) out of 126 SLE patients had LN. Anti-C1q levels were higher in patients with LN as compared to those without (p<0.05). Anti-C1q antibody was also significantly associated with positive C1q immunofluorescence staining in renal biopsy specimens (p<0.05). Overall. renal Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) {OR 1.35 (1.08-1.69)}. low C4 {OR 3.11 (1.04-9.26)} and mucocutaneous manifestation {OR 4.72 (1.38-16.05)} were independently associated with anti-C1q levels in serum. Conclusion: Renal SLEDAI. low C4 and mucocutaneous manifestations were independently associated with raised anti C1q antibody in SLE patients....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Rheumatoid Arthritis
28,The isoquinoline alkaloid berberine possesses many pharmacological activities including antibacterial infection. Although the direct bactericidal effect of berberine has been documented. its influence on the antibacterial functions of macrophages is largely unknown. As inflammasome activation in macrophages is important for the defense against bacterial infection. we aimed to investigate the influence of berberine on inflammasome activation in murine macrophages. Our results showed that berberine significantly increased ATP-induced inflammasome activation as reflected by enhanced pyroptosis as well as increased release of caspase-1p10 and mature interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in macrophages. Such effects of berberine could be suppressed by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor compound C or by knockdown of AMPKa expression. indicating the involvement of AMPK signaling in this process. In line with increased IL-1 beta release. the ability of macrophages to kill engulfed bacteria was also intensified by berberine. This was corroborated by the in vivo finding that the peritoneal live bacterial load was decreased by berberine treatment. Moreover. berberine administration significantly improved survival of bacterial infected mice. concomitant with increased IL-1 beta levels and elevated neutrophil recruitment in the peritoneal cavity. Collectively. these data suggested that berberine could enhance bacterial killing by augmenting inflammasome activation in macrophages through AMPK signaling....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Irritable Bowel Syndrome
29,Gloverin is an antibacterial peptide which has been previously isolated in Hyalophora gloveyi. and is known to exert an inhibition effect on the growth of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). When the expressed genes in the immunized Bombyx mori were screened. gloverin like gene (BmGLP) was found and it was thought to respond against the bacterial invasion. This study presents some data about the gene organization and expression of this candidate for a novel antibacterial peptide in Bombyx mori. The complete sequence. which was determined via RACE. revealed that this BmGLP was identical to the recently reported clone BmGloverin2 mRNA. The transcription of this gene was increased transiently. but to a high degree. around 7 similar to 11 hours after infection. as evidenced by the results of Northern blotting hybridization analysis. Based on the tentative coding sequence. we amplified the genomic sequence and determined that the gene harbored 3 introns. Interestingly. we found retrotransposon relative sequences in introns 1 and 3. Both Southern blotting analysis and sequencing data indicated that the BmGLP2 gene had another relative- or pseudo- sequences in its genome. We also attempted the generation of recombinant peptides in a prokaryotic cell system. but we obtained only truncated peptides and were unable to determine the existence of. any antibacterial activity with the cell extract under physiological conditions. In further studies. the expression system and activity test conditions should be made more representative of the actual insect organism. Finally. we have proposed the possibility that some type of evolutionary link connects retrotransposons activity in insect immunity gene variation....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Immunology
30,The gene expression level for immune system genes was evaluated at different lifecycle stages in the white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). The gene-coding pattern recognition protein. -glucan binding protein-high density lipoprotein (BGBP). from haemocytes. the effector proteins peroxinectin and clotting protein (CP). the antibacterial proteins Lysozyme. Penaeidin 3 and prophenoloxidase (proPO). and the small heat-shock protein 10 were studied. The expression of BGBP was detected from the Nauplii 3 substage and beyond (except for PL1). Peroxinectin and CP were constitutively transcribed throughout the different substages. Lysozyme. Penaeidin and proPO were also detected throughout the experimental stages (except eggs and nauplii). Lysozyme was transcribed during most of the shrimp substages. from Zoea 2 and beyond. Penaeidin 3 exhibited the lowest expression level of the genes evaluated; however. its transcription was similar to those of adults from post-larvae 11 and forward. proPO was higher transcribed during last post-larval substages. Heat-shock protein-10 was detected in all shrimp substages and exhibited higher expression at the PL substages compared to the first larval substages. Evidence suggests that the shrimp immune system is partially activated from the early larval substages. but is not completed until the shrimp have undergone the metamorphic substages....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Immunology,Immunology
31,Despite several conventional potent antibacterial therapies. bacterial infections pose a significant threat to human health because they are emerging as the leading cause of death worldwide. Due to the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. there is a pressing demand to discover novel approaches for developing more effective therapies to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial strains and biofilm-associated infections. Therefore. attention has been especially devoted to a new and emerging branch of science "nanotechnology" to design non-conventional antimicrobial chemotherapies. A range of nanomaterials and nano-sized carriers for conventional antimicrobial agents have fully justified their potential to combat bacterial diseases by reducing cell viability. by attenuating quorum sensing. and by inhibiting/or eradicating biofilms. This communication summarizes emerging nano-antimicrobial therapies in treating bacterial infections. particularly using antibacterial. quorum quenching. and anti-biofilm nanomaterials as new approaches to tackle the current challenges in combating infectious diseases....,Psychology,Medical,Attention,HIV/AIDS
32,Antibiotics are widely used in mariculture industry. and this study attempts to determine the extent of water and sediment pollution by aritibiotic residues in 13 major mariculture sites in China. Through chemical and molecular biology analysis. the results showed that the total concentrations of sulfonamides and tetracyclines were in the range 62.0-373.8 ng L-1 and 0.2-259.1 ng L-1 respectively in water samples. and in the range 0.19-1.59 ng g(-1) dry weight and 3.45-74.84 ng g(-1) dry weight respectively. in sediments samples. The occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) was detected in all sites. Compared with the tetracyclines resistance genes. the absolute copy number and relative abundance of the sulfonamides resistance genes were 4.3 times and 2.3 times higher in water and sediment from the mariculture sites. With the dominant resistance genes being sul2. The abundance of sul3 in the water phase was significantly correlated with the concentrations of sulfamerazine. while the abundance of sul2 in the sediment phase was significantly with sulfadiazine concentrations. The abundance of tetM in the sediment phase was significantly correlated with the concentrations of oxytetracycline. The findings demonstrate the persistence of antibiotic residues and ARGs in major mariculture sites in Southeast China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

33,The alga Cladophora glomerata can erupt in nuisance blooms throughout the lower Great Lakes. Since bacterial abundance increases with the emergence and decay of Cladophora. we investigated the prevalence of antibiotic resistance (ABR) in Cladophora-associated bacterial communities up-gradient and down-gradient from a large sewage treatment plant (STP) on Lake Ontario. Although STPs are well-known sources of ABR. we also expected detectable ABR from up-gradient wetland communities. since they receive surface run-off from urban and agricultural sources. Statistically significant differences in aquatic bacterial abundance and ABR were found between down-gradient beach samples and up-gradient coastal wetland samples (ANOVA. Holm-Sidak test. p < 0.05). Decaying and free-floating Cladophora sampled near the STP had the highest bacterial densities overall. including on ampicillin-and vancomycin-treated plates. However. quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of the ABR genes ampC. tetA. tetB. and vanA from environmental communities showed a different pattern. Some of the highest ABR gene levels occurred at the 2 coastal wetland sites (vanA). Overall. bacterial ABR profiles from environmental samples were distinguishable between living and decaying Cladophora. inferring that Cladophora may control bacterial ABR depending on its life-cycle stage. Our results also show how spatially and temporally dynamic ABR is in nearshore aquatic bacteria. which warrants further research....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Northern blotting
34,The seasonal variation and removal efficiency of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). including tetracycline resistance genes (tetG. tetM. and tetX) and macrolide (ermB. ermF. ereA. and mefA). were investigated in two typical swine wastewater treatment systems in both winter and summer. ARGs. class 1 integron gene. and 16S rRNA gene were quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. There was a 0.31-3.52 log variation in ARGs in raw swine wastewater. and the abundance of ARGs in winter was higher than in summer. tetM. tetX. ermB. ermF. and mefA were highly abundant. The abundance of ARGs was effectively reduced by most individual treatment process and the removal efficiencies of ARGs were higher in winter than in summer. However. when examining relative abundance. the fate of ARGs was quite variable. Anaerobic digestion reduced the relative abundance of tetX. ermB. ermF. and mefA. while lagoon treatment decreased tetM. ermB. ermF. and mefA. Sequencing batch reactor (SBR) decreased tetM. ermB. and ermF. but biofilters and wetlands did not display consistent removal efficiency on ARGs in two sampling seasons. As far as the entire treatment system is concerned. ermB and mefA were effectively reduced in both winter and summer in both total and relative abundance. The relative abundances of tetG and ereA were significantly correlated with intI1 (p<0.01). and both tetG and ereA increased after wastewater treatment. This may pose a great threat to public health....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Molecular biology
35,The objectives of this study were to determine the kinetic parameters of purified recombinant Bla(Mab) and Bla(Mmas) by spectrophotometry. analyze the genetic environment of the bla(Mab) and bla(Mmas) genes in both species by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. furthermore. in silico models of both enzymes in complex with imipenem were obtained by modeling tools. Our results showed that Bla(Mab) and Bla(Mmas) have a similar hydrolysis behavior. displaying high catalytic efficiencies toward penams. cephalothin. and nitrocefin; none of the enzymes are well inhibited by clavulanate. Bla(Mmas) hydrolyzes imipenem at higher efficiency than cefotaxime and aztreonam. Bla(Mab) and Bla(Mmas) showed that their closest structural homologs are KPC-2 and SFC-1. which correlate to the mild carbapenemase activity toward imipenem observed at least for BlaMmas. They also seem to differ from other class A -lactamases by the presence of a more flexible loop. which could impact in the hydrolysis efficiency against some antibiotics.

36,Natural tetracycline (TC) antibiotics were the first major class of therapeutics to earn the distinction of 'broad-spectrum antibiotics' and they have been used since the 1940s against a wide range of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. mycoplasmas. intracellular chlamydiae. rickettsiae and protozoan parasites. The second generation of semisynthetic tetracyclines. such as minocycline and doxycycline. with improved antimicrobial potency. were introduced during the 1960s. Despite emerging resistance to TCs erupting during the 1980s. it was not until 2006. more than four decades later. that a third-generation TC. named tigecycline. was launched. In addition. two TC analogues. omadacycline and eravacycline. developed via (semi)synthetic and fully synthetic routes. respectively. are at present under clinical evaluation. Interestingly. despite very productive early work on the isolation of a Streptomyces aureofaciens mutant strain that produced 6-demethyl-7-chlortetracycline. the key intermediate in the production of second- and third-generation TCs. biosynthetic approaches in TC development have not been productive for more than 50 years. Relatively slow and tedious molecular biology approaches for the genetic manipulation of TC-producing actinobacteria. as well as an insufficient understanding of the enzymatic mechanisms involved in TC biosynthesis have significantly contributed to the low success of such biosynthetic engineering efforts. However. new opportunities in TC drug development have arisen thanks to a significant progress in the development of affordable and versatile biosynthetic engineering and synthetic biology approaches.. and. importantly. to a much deeper understanding of TC biosynthesis. mostly gained over the last two decades....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Fungal Infection
37,abYsis is a web-based antibody research system that includes an integrated database of antibody sequence and structure data. The system can be interrogated in numerous ways from simple text and sequence searches to sophisticated queries that apply 3D structural constraints. The publicly available version includes pre-analyzed sequence data from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory European Nucleotide Archive (EMBL-ENA) and Kabat as well as structure data from the Protein Data Bank. A researcher's own sequences can also be analyzed through the web interface. A defining characteristic of abYsis is that the sequences are automatically numbered with a series of popular schemes such as Kabat and Chothia and then annotated with key information such as complementarity-determining regions and potential post-translational modifications. A unique aspect of abYsis is a set of residue frequency tables for each position in an antibody. allowing "unusual residues" (those rarely seen at a particular position) to be highlighted and decisions to be made on which mutations may be acceptable. This is especially useful when comparing antibodies from different species. abYsis is useful for any researcher specializing in antibody engineering. especially those developing antibodies as drugs. abYsis is available at www.abysis.org.

38,The introduction of more sensitive techniques. such as LuminexA (R) for HLA antibody screening of patients awaiting organ transplantation has resulted in a better understanding of transplantation immunology and improvements in clinical practice. The interpretation of the results obtained only by LuminexA (R) can lead to inaccurate evaluation of a patient's antibody status and unjustified rejection of a potential organ donor. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the benefits of performing HLA antibody screening in the sera of patients on the waiting list for organ transplantation by two different assays. complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and LuminexA (R). A retrospective analysis was performed on 563 pretransplant serum samples from 141 patients on the kidney transplantation waiting list in Rijeka. tested from March 2012 until March 2015. All samples were tested in parallel by the CDC assay and the LuminexA (R)-based assay. Out of the 563 samples tested 302 (53.7%) tested negative for HLA antibodies and 88 (15.6%) positive by both assays. From 173 (30.7%) samples with discordant results 149 (26.5%) were CDC negative and LuminexA (R) positive. while 24 (4.3%) were CDC positive and LuminexA (R) negative. Among the Luminex positive patients seven did not experience any immunizing events. Evaluation of the HLA antibody status in patients on a waiting list for organ transplantation should be based on the results of the both CDC and LuminexA (R) (or other sensitive) assays in accordance to information about patient's clinical status and exposure to immunizing events....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,HIV/AIDS
39,Effects in the liver of fatal intoxication with the binary toxin ricin are unclear. We report a robust neutrophil influx into the liver of C57BL/6 mice after lethal parenteral ricin challenge. occurring in peri-portal and centro-lobular hepatic areas within 2 h. followed by the abrupt disappearance of hepatic macrophages/Kupffer cells. Chemokine profiles determined by microarray. ribonuclease protection assays. northern blotting. and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed rapid (2 h) upregulation and persistence of those for neutrophils (CXCL1/KC. CXCL2/MIP-2) and monocytes (CCL2/MCP-1). Red blood cell pooling (8-12 h). loss of hepatocyte glycogen (8-48 h) associated with progressive hypoglycemia. fibrin deposition (24-48 h). and death (72-96 h) followed. Monoclonal antibody to ricin A chain. administered intravenously. blunted hypoglycemia. and abrogated death. This outcome was observed when anti-ricin antibody was given before toxin exposure as well as when administered approximately 10 h after toxin exposure. Targeting antibody to specific amino-acid sequences on the ricin A chain (HAEL and QXXWXXA) was critical to the therapeutic effect. Re-emergence of liver macrophages/Kupffer cells and replenishment of glycogen in previously depleted hepatocytes preceded full recovery of the host. These data identify critical events for liver injury and healing in ricin intoxication. as well as a new means and specific targets for post- exposure therapeutic intervention....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Hepatitis C
40,HIV-1 infection occurs primarily through mucosal transmission. Application of biologically relevant mucosal models can advance understanding of the functional properties of antibodies that mediate HIV protection. thereby guiding antibody-based vaccine development. Here. we employed a human ex vivo vaginal HIV-1 infection model and a rhesus macaque in vivo intrarectal SHIV challenge model to probe the protective capacity of monoclonal broadly-neutralizing (bnAb) and non-neutralizing Abs (nnAbs) that were functionally modified by isotype switching. For human vaginal explants. we developed a replication-competent. secreted NanoLuc reporter virus system and showed that CD4 binding site bnAbs b12 IgG1 and CH31 IgG1 and IgA2 isoforms potently blocked HIV-1JR-CSF and HIV-1Bal26 infection. However. IgG1 and IgA nnAbs. either alone or together. did not inhibit infection despite the presence of FcR-expressing effector cells in the tissue. In macaques. the CH31 IgG1 and IgA2 isoforms infused before high-dose SHIV challenge were completely to partially protective. respectively. while nnAbs (CH54 IgG1 and CH38 mIgA2) were non-protective. Importantly. in both mucosal models IgG1 isotype bnAbs were more protective than the IgA2 isotypes. attributable in part to greater neutralization activity of the IgG1 variants. These findings underscore the importance of potent bnAb induction as a primary goal of HIV-1 vaccine development. (C) 2016 The Authors.

41,Immunoglobulin therapy is a key element in the management of most patients with primary immunodeficiency disease. Allergist/immunologists should be familiar with the appropriate evaluation of candidates for immunoglobulin. the characteristics of immunoglobulin products. and how to use them to provide the best care to their patients. Available immunoglobulin products appear to be equally efficacious. but they are not interchangeable. Minimizing the risk of serious adverse events and controlling minor side effects is important to ideal patient care. Immunoglobulin may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. Individualizing the choice of immunoglobulin product. mode of administration. and site of care can optimize the clinical outcome and minimize the burden of care. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy.

42,Since the development of antibody-production techniques. a number of immunoglobulins have been developed on a large scale using conventional methods. Hybridoma technology opened a new horizon in the production of antibodies against target antigens of infectious pathogens. malignant diseases including autoimmune disorders. and numerous potent toxins. However. these clinical humanized or chimeric murine antibodies have several limitations and complexities. Therefore. to overcome these difficulties. recent advances in genetic engineering techniques and phage display technique have allowed the production of highly specific recombinant antibodies. These engineered antibodies have been constructed in the hunt for novel therapeutic drugs equipped with enhanced immunoprotective abilities. such as engaging immune effector functions. effective development of fusion proteins. efficient tumor and tissue penetration. and high-affinity antibodies directed against conserved targets. Advanced antibody engineering techniques have extensive applications in the fields of immunology. biotechnology. diagnostics. and therapeutic medicines. However. there is limited knowledge regarding dynamic antibody development approaches. Therefore. this review extends beyond our understanding of conventional polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore. recent advances in antibody engineering techniques together with antibody fragments. display technologies. immunomodulation. and broad applications of antibodies are discussed to enhance innovative antibody production in pursuit of a healthier future for humans....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Alzheimer's Disease
43,Somatic mutations within the antibody variable domains are critical to the immense capacity of the immune repertoire. Here. via a deep mutational scan. we dissect how mutations at all positions of the variable domains of a high-affinity anti-VEGF antibody G6.31 impact its antigen-binding function. The resulting mutational landscape demonstrates that large portions of antibody variable domain positions are open to mutation. and that beneficial mutations can be found throughout the variable domains. We determine the role of one antigen-distal light chain position 83. demonstrating that mutation at this site optimizes both antigen affinity and thermostability by modulating the interdomain conformational dynamics of the antigen-binding fragment. Furthermore. by analyzing a large number of human antibody sequences and structures. we demonstrate that somatic mutations occur frequently at position 83. with corresponding domain conformations observed for G6.31. Therefore. the modulation of interdomain dynamics represents an important mechanism during antibody maturation in vivo....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Immunology,Immunology
44,Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate among cancer patients in the world. in particular because most patients are only diagnosed at an advanced and noncurable stage. Computed tomography (CT) screening on high-risk individuals has shown that early detection could reduce the mortality rate. However. the still high false-positive rate of CT screening may harm healthy individuals because of unnecessary follow-up scans and invasive follow-up procedures. Alternatively. false-negative and indeterminate results may harm patients due to the delayed diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Noninvasive biomarkers. complementary to CT screening. could lower the false-positive and false-negative rate of CT screening at baseline and thereby reduce the number of patients that need follow-up and diagnose patients at an earlier stage of lung cancer. Lung cancer tissue generates lung cancer-associated proteins to which the immune system might produce high-affinity autoantibodies. This autoantibody response to tumor-associated antigens starts during early stage lung cancer and may endure over years. Identification of tumor-associated antigens or the corresponding autoantibodies in body fluids as potential noninvasive biomarkers could thus be an effective approach for early detection and monitoring of lung cancer. We provide an overview of differentially expressed protein. antigen. and autoantibody biomarkers that combined with CT imaging might be of clinical use for early detection of lung cancer....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Cancer
45,Immune defenses are expected to be crucial for survival under the considerable parasite pressures experienced by wild animals. However. our understanding of the association between immunity and fitness in nature remains limited due to both the complexity of the vertebrate immune system and the often-limited availability of immune reagents in nonmodel organisms. Here. we use methods and reagents developed by veterinary researchers for domestic ungulates on blood samples collected from a wild Soay sheep population. to evaluate an unusually broad panel of immune parameters. Our evaluation included different innate and acquired immune cell types as well as nematode parasite-specific antibodies of different isotypes. We test how these markers correlate with one another. how they vary with age-group and sex. and. crucially. whether they predict over-winter survival either within or among demographic groups. We found anticipated patterns of variation in markers with age. associated with immune development. and once these age trends were accounted for. correlations among our 11 immune markers were generally weak. We found that females had higher proportions of naive T cells and gamma-delta T cells than males. independent of age. while our other markers did not differ between sexes. Only one of our 11 markers predicted overwinter survival: sheep with higher plasma levels of anti-nematode IgG antibodies were significantly more likely to survive the subsequent high mortality winter. independent of age. sex. or weight. This supports a previous finding from this study system using a different set of samples and shows that circulating antibody levels against ecologically relevant parasites in natural systems represent an important parameter of immune function and may be under strong natural selection. Our data provide rare insights into patterns of variation among age-and sex groups in different T-cell subsets and antibody levels in the wild. and suggest that certain types of immune response-notably those likely to be repeatable within individuals and linked to resistance to ecologically relevant parasites-may be most informative for research into the links between immunity and fitness under natural conditions....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,HIV/AIDS
46,The scale and scope of the global epidemic. coupled to challenges with traditional vaccine development approaches. point toward a need for novel methodologies for HIV vaccine research. While the development of vaccines able to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies remains the ultimate goal. to date. vaccines continue to fail to induce these rare humoral immune responses. Conversely. growing evidence across vaccine platforms in both non-human primates and humans points to a role for polyclonal vaccine-induced antibody responses in protection from infection. These candidate vaccines. despite employing disparate viral vectors and immunization strategies. consistently identify a role for functional or non-traditional antibody activities as correlates of immunity. However. the precise mechanism(s) of action of these binding antibodies. their specific characteristics. and their ability to be selectively induced and/or potentiated to result in complete protection merits parallel investigation to neutralizing antibody-based vaccine design approaches. Ultimately. while neutralizing and functional antibody-based vaccine strategies need not be mutually exclusive. defining the specific characteristics of protective functional antibodies may provide a target immune profile to potentially induce more robust immunity against HIV. Specifically. one approach to guide the development of functional antibody-based vaccine strategies. termed systems serology. offers an unbiased and comprehensive approach to systematically survey humoral immune responses. capturing the array of functions and humoral response characteristics that may be induced following vaccination with high resolution. Coupled to machine learning tools. large datasets that explore the antibody-ome offer a means to step back from anticipated correlates and mechanisms of protection and toward a more fundamental understanding of coordinated aspects of humoral immune responses. to more globally differentiate among vaccine candidates. and most critically. to identify the features of humoral immunity that distinguish protective from non-protective responses. Overall. the systematic serological approach described here aimed at broadly capturing the enormous biodiversity in antibody profiles that may emerge following vaccination. complements the existing cutting edge tools in the cellular immunology space that survey vaccine-induced polyfunctional cellular activity by flow cytometry. transcriptional profiling. epigenetic. and metabolomic analysis to offer a means to develop both a more nuanced and a more complete understanding of correlates of protection to support the design of functional vaccine strategies....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,HIV/AIDS
47,Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by the proliferation of immature myeloid lineage blasts. Due to its heterogeneity and to the high rate of acquired drug resistance and relapse. new treatment strategies are needed. Here. we demonstrate that IFN promotes AML blasts to act as effector cells within the context of antibody therapy. Treatment with IFN drove AML blasts toward a more differentiated state. wherein they showed increased expression of the M1-related markers HLA-DR and CD86. as well as of FcRI. which mediates effector responses to therapeutic antibodies. Importantly. IFN was able to up-regulate CD38. the target of the therapeutic antibody daratumumab. Because the antigen (CD38) and effector receptor (FcRI) were both simultaneously up-regulated on the AML blasts. we tested whether IFN treatment of the AML cell lines THP-1 and MV4-11 could stimulate them to target one another after the addition of daratumumab. Results showed that IFN significantly increased daratumumab-mediated cytotoxicity. as measured both by Cr-51 release and lactate dehydrogenase release assays. We also found that the combination of IFN and activation of FcR led to the release of granzyme B by AML cells. Finally. using a murine NSG model of subcutaneous AML. we found that treatment with IFN plus daratumumab significantly attenuated tumor growth. Taken together. these studies show a novel mechanism of daratumumab-mediated killing and a possible new therapeutic strategy for AML....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Lymphoma
48,Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is known as the most successful microbial insecticide against different orders of insect pests in agriculture and medicine. Moreover. Bt toxin genes also have been efficiently used to enhance resistance to insect pests in genetically modified crops. In light of the scientific advantages of new molecular biology technologies. recently. some other new potentials of Bt have been explored. These new environmental features include the toxicity against nematodes. mites. and ticks. antagonistic effects against plant and animal pathogenic bacteria and fungi. plant growth-promoting activities (PGPR). bioremediation of different heavy metals and other pollutants. biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles. production of polyhydroxyalkanoate biopolymer. and anticancer activities (due to parasporins). This review comprehensively describes recent advances in the Bt whole-genome studies. the last updated known Bt toxins and their functions. and application of cry genes in plant genetic engineering.

49,The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of costimulation blockade with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated-antigen 4-immunoglobulin (CTLA4Ig) and anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody (anti-CD40L mAb) on an experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) mouse model. Characteristics of myocardial tissue were observed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of CTLA4. CD40L. IFN-gamma. and IL-4 were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Serum concentrations of IFN-gamma and IL-4 were determined by ELISA. After immune intervention. the inflammatory score. mRNA levels of CTLA4 and CD40L. and IFN-gamma level were decreased. Furthermore. these parameters in the combinational intervention group (blockade by CTLA4Ig and anti-CD40L mAb) were significantly decreased. compared to the single intervention group (blockade by CTLA4Ig or anti-CD40L mAb). However. after costimulation. blockade serum IL-4 levels were increased. Therefore. costimulation blockade by combination CTLA4Ig and anti-CD40L mAb could more effectively inhibit the inflammatory response of EAM than single use of CTLA4Ig or anti-CD40L mAb....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Heart Disease
50,Objective: Arginine-specific cysteine proteases (Rgps) from Porphyromonas gingivalis are important virulent factors of periodontal diseases. However. there is no therapeutic drug that inhibits proinflammatory events induced by these enzymes. In this study. we investigated proinflammatory activities of Rgps and activated coagulation factor X (FXa) and examined the effect of DX-9065a. a new selective inhibitor of FXa. on proinflammatory events induced by these proteinases. Methods: Human gingival fibroblasts were stimulated with Rgps and FXa in the presence or absence of DX-9065a. and then interleukin-6 (IL-6) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) release. their mRNA expression. and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). northern blotting. and a gel-mobility shift method. respectively. Results: Rgps and FXa activated IL-6 and MMP-1 release in human gingival fibroblasts through their amidolytic activities and in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-kappa B dependent manners. DX-9065a inhibited FXa-mduced IL-6 mRNA expression and NF-kappa B activation. DX-9065a inhibited amidolytic activities of FXa and Rgps in vitro and ex vivo. Conclusion: Rgps and FXa are potent inflammatory mediators and DX-9065a may be a useful therapeutic drug for periodontal disease....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Ankylosing Spondylitis
51,In this study. drug target was identified using KEGG database and network analysis through Cytoscape software. Designed series of novel benzimidazoles were taken along with reference standard Flibanserin for insilico modeling. The novel 4-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-N-(substituted phenyl)-4-oxobutanamide (3a-j) analogs were synthesized and evaluated for their antidepressant activity. Reaction of 4-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (1) with 4-(1H-benzo [d] imidazol-2-yl)-4-oxobutanoyl chloride (2) furnished novel 4-(1H-benzo [d] imidazol-2-yl)-N-(substituted phenyl)-4-oxobutanamide (3a-j). All the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR. H-1-NMR. and mass spectral analysis. The antidepressant activities of synthesized derivatives were compared with standard drug clomipramine at a dose level of 20mg/kg. Among the derivatives tested. most of the compounds were found to have potent activity against depression. The high level of activity was shown by the compounds 3d. 3e. 3i. and it significantly reduced the duration of immobility time at the dose level of 50mg/kg....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Depression
52,ObjectiveTo explore the prevalence and clinical profile of males and females who develop antidepressant treatment-emergent mania (ATEM). MethodFrom an original sample of 754 patients with BD. we identified ATEM+ cases (n = 75) and ATEM- controls (n = 135) that met stringent criteria. We specifically examined the combinations of clinical factors that best classified males and females as ATEM+ cases. ResultsSeventy-five individuals were classified as ATEM+; 87% of ATEM events occurred during antidepressant monotherapy. Regression analyses demonstrated that the presence of an alcohol and/or substance use disorder [Odds Ratio (OR) 6.37]. a history of one or more suicide attempts (OR 4.19) and higher number of depressive episodes per year of illness (OR 1.71) correctly classified 73% of males. In contrast. 84% of females were correctly classified on the basis of a positive history of thyroid disorder (OR 3.23). a positive family history of BD I (OR 2.68) and depressive onset polarity (OR 2.01). ConclusionUsing stringent definitions of ATEM status to reduce the probability of inclusion of false-positive cases and false-negative controls. we identified for the first time that the risk profiles for the development of an ATEM differ significantly according to gender....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Bipolar Disorder
53,Approximately 40% of patients treated for depression do not respond to a trial of an antidepressant. The aim of the proposed study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching to vilazodone in patients with major depressive disorder who are unresponsive or only partially responsive to a trial of citalopram. Seventy-nine adults with major depressive disorder were enrolled in an open-label study of citalopram (20mg/day) for 6 weeks. Those still symptomatic after 6-weeks of citalopram were randomly assigned to either a higher dose of citalopram (40mg/day) or to vilazodone in a double-blind trial for 6 weeks. Of those who received citalopram 20mg/day for 6 weeks. 20.3% were responders' (defined as 50% reduction on the Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale). Of the 42 who did not respond. 23 were assigned to citalopram 40mg/day and 19 were randomized to 40mg/day of vilazodone. Both groups showed decreases in all outcome measures. but there were no significant differences between groups. Initial nonresponders to a low dose of citalopram seem equally likely to respond to a higher dose of citalopram or to vilazodone. Whether to increase an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or switch to a different antidepressant may be best determined on the basis of their adverse event profile....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Depression
54,Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is often resistant to treatment with usual approaches. Patients with MDD have shown hypofunction of the frontotemporal cortex in verbal fluency test (VFT)-related near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Methods: We examined whether the reactions to drug treatment in treatment-naive patients with MDD could be predicted by NIRS outcomes at the initial investigation. All subjects underwent psychological testing to determine levels of anxiety and depression. VFT was used to examine the functioning of the frontotemporal lobes. We administered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for 12 weeks. Subjects included 28 patients with MDD with response to SSRIs (Response group). 19 with no response (Non-Response group). and 63 age-. sex-. and education years-matched healthy controls (HC). Results: We found in the frontotemporal region that hemodynamic responses were significantly smaller in patients with Response and Non-Response groups than in HC before treatment. We also found in the medial frontal region that hemodynamic responses were significantly larger in patients with Response groups than in patients with Non-Response group before treatment. Patients with MDD scored significantly higher anxiety and depressive states than those in HC on several measures. The Response and Non-Response groups also had higher scores in future denial. threat prediction. self-denial. past denial. and interpersonal threat sections of Anxiety Cognition Scale (DACS). According to the stepwise regression analysis. one variable was determined as independent predictors of response: confusion (Post-POMS). Limitations: The number of patients and healthy controls was relatively small. and we will increase the number of participants in future studies. NIRS has reduced spatial resolution. which confuses the identification of the measurement position when using NIRS alone. Conclusion: Cognitive vulnerabilities are associated with predictors of SSRI treatment response. Different hemodynamic activities in the frontotemporal cortex predict response to SSRI treatment in MDD....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Depression
55,No study has investigated psychological dependence on antidepressants in patients with panic disorder. which was addressed in this study. This study was carried out in four psychiatric clinics in Tokyo. Japan. Individuals were eligible if they were outpatients aged 18 years or older and fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder (ICD-10). Assessments included the Japanese Versions of the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS). the Self-Report Version of Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS-SR). and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report. Eighty-four individuals were included; of these. 30 patients (35.7%) showed psychological dependence on antidepressants (i.e. a total score of >= 5 in the SDS). A multiple regression analysis showed that PDSS scores and illness duration were correlated positively with SDS total scores. A binary regression model showed that absence of remission (i.e. a total score of >= 5 in the PDSS) and longer duration of illness increased the risk of dependence on antidepressants. Approximately one-third of the patients with panic disorder. receiving antidepressants. fulfilled the criteria for psychological dependence on these drugs. The results underscore the need for close monitoring. especially for those who present severe symptomatology or have a chronic course of the illness. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health. Inc.

56,Objective: To assess systematically the effects of antidepressants and untreated maternal depression on human placenta and the developing fetus.Methods: Pertinent medical literature information was identified using MEDLINE/PubMed. SCOPUS and EMBASE. Electronic searches. limited to human studies published in English. provided 21 studies reporting primary data on placental and fetal effects of antidepressant exposure or untreated gestational depression.Results: The impact of antidepressants and non-medicated maternal depression on placental functioning and fetal biochemical architecture seems to be demonstrated. although its clinical significance remains unclear. More robust data seem to indicate that exposure to either antidepressants or untreated maternal depression may induce epigenetic changes and interfere with the physiological fetal behavior. Two cases of iatrogenic fetal tachyarrhythmia have also been reported.Conclusions: Future research should clarify the clinical relevance of the impact of antidepressant and untreated maternal depression exposure on placental functioning. Moreover. ultrasound studies investigating fetal responses to antidepressants or maternal depressive symptoms are mandatory. This assessment should be performed during the whole duration of gestational period. when different fetal behavioral patterns become progressively detectable. Analyses of biochemical and epigenetic modifications associated with maternal mood symptoms and antidepressant treatment should also be implemented....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Depression
57,Antibodies against the toxin portion of recombinant immunotoxins (RIT) reduce their efficacy and pose a potential safety risk. To overcome this problem we mutated the very immunogenic immunotoxin SS1P to produce LMB-T20. a de-immunized RIT that has the eight human T-cell epitopes in SS1P modified or removed. To determine the effect of T-cell epitope removal in vivo we mapped the T-cell epitopes in immune-competent BALB/c mice and found that these mice recognize two epitopes. One corresponds to the human immunodominant T-cell epitope and the other to a human subdominant epitope; both were eliminated in LMB-T20. We found that mice immunized with LMB-T20 did not have T-cell activation and did not develop anti-drug antibodies (ADA). whereas mice immunized with SS1P. showed T-cell activation. and developed ADA detected by both ELISA and drug neutralizing assays. The ability of the mice treated with LMB-T20 to respond to other antigens was not compromised. We conclude that elimination of T-cell epitopes is sufficient to prevent formation of antibodies to an immunogenic foreign protein.Cellular & Molecular Immunology (2017) published online 19 October 2015...,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Rheumatoid Arthritis
58,Objectives - Whether and when to immunologically treat epilepsy patients with suggested autoantibody (AB)-negative limbic encephalitis (LE) is clinically challenging. Therefore. we evaluated the clinical outcome and eventual outcome predictors of immunotherapy in a group of AB-negative patients with recent-onset temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicators of LE. subjective cognitive decline. and/or psychiatric symptoms. Methods - This retrospective. observational. uncontrolled study monitored 28 TLE patients with suggested AB-negative LE along with methylprednisolone immunotherapy. Results - All patients had seizures. amygdala and/or - hippocampal enlargement. subjective cognitive decline and/or behavioral problems. Eighty-six percent (24/28) were impaired in executive or memory functions. 39% (10/25) depressed. 81% were on antiepileptic drugs when pulse therapy started. After a median follow-up of 18 months. 46% (13/28) of the patients were seizure free (>2 months). 48% (13/27) showed MRI improvements (amygdala and/or hippocampal volume reduction). cognition improved in 57% (16/28). worsened in 32% (9/28). mood improved in 14% (4/25). and deteriorated in 11% (3/25). Immunotherapy was discontinued in 75% (21/28). Clinical changes did not correlate to each other. Outcomes could not be predicted. Conclusion - Immunological treatment of suggested AB-negative LE showed reasonable seizure control. MRI and cognitive improvements. Treatment success was not predictable from clinical features. nor definitely attributable to immunological treatment. Lacking biomarkers for the reliable diagnosis of AB-negative LE. we suggest that in presence of mild manifestations. and after initiating antiepileptic drug therapy. negative dynamics in MRI. seizures. cognition. and behavior should be documented before immunosuppressive treatment is initiated....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Multiple Sclerosis
59,ERp57 is a member of a protein disulfide isomerase family and is a chaperone responsible for the correct folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the assembly of the major histocompatibility complex class I in the endogenous pathway of antigen presentation. This study reports the identification of a full length ERp57 cDNA in rainbow trout that encodes a putative 477aa mature protein with an additional signal sequence of 16aa. The trout protein shared 75% identity with the human homolog. but interestingly did not include either a C terminal endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. Q/KEDL in humans. or a nuclear localization signal which is highly conserved in mammals. Amino acid sequence alignment revealed conservation of four classical domains in trout ERp57 and two conserved active CXXC redox motifs. Trout ERp57 protein was identified as a single band around 57 kDa. Southern blotting analysis revealed that there two copies of the ERp57 gene in the trout genome and northern blotting showed a wide tissue distribution of gene expression in various tissues with the highest expression in liver and egg. This study showed for the first time in teleost that ERp57 transcript is upregulated in response to immune stimuli such as double stranded RNA or phytohemagglutinin. Furthermore. upon treatment with ER stress inducer A23187. trout ERp57 protein expression levels were increased both in peripheral blood leukocytes and the RTS11 macrophage like cell line after 6 and 8 h respectively.

60,The MHC class I and II antigen processing and presentation pathways display peptides to circulating CD8(+) cytotoxic and CD4(+) helper T cells respectively to enable pathogens and transformed cells to be identified. Once detected. T cells become activated and either directly kill the infected /transformed cells (CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes) or orchestrate the activation of the adaptive immune response (CD4(+) T cells). The immune surveillance of transformed/tumour cells drives alteration of the antigen processing and presentation pathways to evade detection and hence the immune response. Evasion of the immune response is a significant event tumour development and considered one of the hallmarks of cancer. To avoid immune recognition. tumours employ a multitude of strategies with most resulting in a down-regulation of the MHC class I expression at the cell surface. significantly impairing the ability of CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes to recognize the tumour. Alteration of the expression of key players in antigen processing not only affects MHC class I expression but also significantly alters the repertoire of peptides being presented. These modified peptide repertoires may serve to further reduce the presentation of tumour-specific/associated antigenic epitopes to aid immune evasion and tumour progression. Here we review the modifications to the antigen processing and presentation pathway in tumours and how it affects the anti-tumour immune response. considering the role of tumour-infiltrating cell populations and highlighting possible future therapeutic targets....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Cancer
61,In the treatment of hemophilia A. the 20%-30% risk of developing of anti-factor VIII (FVIII) antibodies. or inhibitors. is the dominant concern among healthcare providers. Immune tolerance induction remains the only effective method of eradicating inhibitors in approximately 75% of patients. but is accompanied by significant emotional and economical burden. While certain risk factors. such as the type of FVIII mutation. offer some insight. there remains no strategy to confidently predict the development of an inhibitor. Moreover. even if such a predictive tool existed. there is currently no proven protocol for tolerance induction of a previously untreated patient. In recent years. the growing body of knowledge concerning the fundamental immunology of inhibitors has shed light on potential therapeutic interventions. In this review. we highlight these new findings and their influences on translational medicine....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Hereditary Angioedema
62,Mycobacterium tuberculosis produces dideoxymy-cobactin- 838 (DDM-838). a lipopeptide that potently activates T cells upon binding to the MHC-like antigen-presenting molecule CD1a. M. tuberculosis produces DDM-838 in only trace amounts and a previous solid-phase synthesis provided sub-milligram quantities. We describe a high-yielding solution-phase synthesis of DDM-838 that features a Mitsunobu substitution that avoids yield-limiting epimerization at lysine during esterification. and amidation conditions that prevent double-bond isomerization of the Z-C20:1 acyl chain. and provides material with equivalent antigenicity to natural DDM-838. Isomers of DDM-838 that varied in stereochemistry at the central lysine and the C20:1 acyl chain were compared for their ability to be recognised by CD1a-restricted T cell receptors (TCRs). These TCRs. derived from unrelated human donors. exhibited a similar spectrum of reactivity towards the panel of DDM-838 isomers. highlighting the exquisite sensitivity of lipopeptide-reactive T cells for the natural DDM stereochemistry....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Immunology,Immunology
63,The presence of anti-HLA antibodies in the serum of a patient result from an immune response produced during an immunizing event as transfusion. pregnancy or graft. These antibodies can be cytotoxic by activating the complement pathway via C1q and may cause organ rejection during the transplant. Some male patients awaiting kidney transplantation are seropositive for anti-HLA antibodies when they have no immunizing antecedent event. These antibodies are qualified as natural antibodies. Our work is to assess the cytotoxicity of natural anti-HLA antibodies in patients followed at the immunology laboratory of the blood transfusion service and hemovigilance (STSH) as part of the kidney transplant. Patients and methods. - We evaluated the cytotoxicity of HLA antibodies detected in male Moroccan patients without immunization history using C1q Screen One Lambda reagent for Luminex (TM) Results. - Non-immunized men were positive for HLA antibodies screening in 25.4%. These antibodies are not cytotoxic. Conclusion. - Our study showed a positivity rate of natural HLA antibody low than the literature (25.4% against 63%). It appears that these natural antibodies are not cytotoxic and their involvement in renal transplant remains to be determined. (C) 2016 Association Societe de nephrologie.

64,Glycyrrhiza uralensis has acquired significant importance due to its medicinal properties and health function. In this study. the quality of G. uralensis adventitious roots was evaluated in terms of genetic stability. active compounds. and anti-inflammatory activity. Monomorphic banding pattern obtained from the mother plant and tissue cultures of G. uralensis with randomly amplified polymorphic DNA markers confirmed the genetic stability of adventitious roots. Neoliquiritin (neoisoliquiritin). ononin. liquiritin. and glycyrrhizic acid were identified from G. uralensis adventitious roots on the basis of high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. This study also revealed that adventitious roots possessed a better anti-inflammatory effect than native roots. To increase the contents of G. uralensis active components. elicitors were used in the adventitious roots culture. The combination of methyl jasmonate and phenylalanine synergistically stimulated the accumulation of glycyrrhetinic acid (0.22 mg/g) and total flavonoid (5.43 mg/g) compared with single treatment. In conclusion. G. uralensis adventitious roots can be an exploitable system for the production of licorice. (C) 2016 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

65,Background: One of the most significant contributors to morbidity and death in patients with burns is infection. which accounts for 30%-75% of post-burn fatalities. Because of concerns for the development of antibiotic resistance in burn-related pathogens. the aims of this study were to identify antibiotic resistance trends for the four most common burn-related pathogens over a six-year period. Patients and Methods: The study used prospectively collected and de-identified aggregate data for all burn patients admitted to the burn unit between 2009 and 2014. The database query included patient demographics along with all data regarding cultures from any source (wound. sputum. urine. stool. blood). which included isolated pathogens and antibiotic resistance profiles. Profiles were then constructed using mean inhibitory concentration standards to determine whether each pathogen was susceptible (S). intermediate (I). or resistant (R) to each antibiotic. The aggregated data were then used to construct a heat map for the four most common pathogens and their resistance profiles over the six-year study period. Results: There were 368 patients with burns (248 with positive cultures. 120 with negative cultures) in this study. The positive culture group was significantly older (38 vs. 25y. p<0.001) and had longer hospitalizations (17 vs. 11 d. p<0.01) compared with the negative group. Analysis of antibiotic resistance heat maps constructed for the four most commonly isolated pathogens (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecalis. methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) indicated a lack of notable resistance patterns for any of the individual pathogens. Conclusions: Taken together. these results indicate that there are no discernible patterns of antibiotic resistance across time (six years) for the four most common burn-related pathogens. We conclude that antibiotic choice in burn patients based on previous in-hospital trends may be a flawed strategy. Emerging genomic technology to deliver point-of-care pathogen-specific antibiotic sensitivities via polymerase chain reaction may be needed to more appropriately guide antibiotic choice....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Fungal Infection

67,Purpose. The impact of an antimicrobial stewardship initiative on time to first antibiotic dose and clinical outcomes in bacteremic patients was. evaluated. Methods. A single-center. retrospective study was conducted for adult inpatients who received antibiotics before and after implementation of a rapid administration of antimicrobials by an infectious diseases specialist (RAIDS) protocol. Patients admitted to an inpatient service from June to October 2011 (pre-RAIDS protocol) and from December 2011 to February 2012 (post-RAIDS protocol) were eligible for inclusion if (1) they were age 18 years or older. (2) their infection occurred two or more days after hospital admission. and (3) they had a blood culture growing an organism other than common skin contaminants (i.e.. coagulase-negative staphylococci. Bacillus species). The primary outcome was the time to the first antibiotic dose (TFAD). defined as the time that elapsed from a positive blood culture result to administration of the first empirical antimicrobial dose. Results. A total of 111 bacteremic patients were included in the analysis. Implementation of the RAIDS protocol led to significantly faster antibiotic order entry. verification. and administration of empirical antibiotics in patients with bacteremia. The median TFAD was approximately 8 hours faster in the post-RAIDS group than in the pre-RAIDS group (9:09 hr:min versus 1:23 hr:min. p < 0.001). Patients in the post-RAIDS group had a significant reduction in infection-related mortality (p = 0.047). though all cause 30-day mortality was similar. Conclusion. Early notification of an infectious diseases pharmacist about positive blood cultures using the RAIDS protocol led to increased appropriateness of empirical drug selection and a dramatic reduction in the administration of antibiotics and was associated with decreased infection related mortality....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,HIV/AIDS
68,Background:Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) constitutes about 15% to 20% of all cases of tuberculosis (TB). The confirmation of EPTB has always been a challenge to laboratory personnel. We aim to evaluate the diagnostic potential of immunostaining with anti-MPT64 in various EPTB specimens.Materials and Methods:We studied a total of 51 TB cases and 38 non-TB control specimens comprising of fine-needle aspirates and formalin-fixed biopsies. These were investigated using a combination of the Ziehl-Neelsen method. the Lowenstein-Jensen culture. immunostaining with anti-MPT64 and anti-BCG. and nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for IS6110. Results of all the tests were compared using nested-PCR as the gold standard.Results:Diagnostic validation of immunostaining for anti-MPT64 was performed using nested-PCR as the gold standard. The overall sensitivity. specificity. and positive and negative predictive values for immunostaining with anti-MPT64 were 100%. 97%. 97%. and 100%. respectively.Conclusions:Immunostaining using anti-MPT64 is a rapid and sensitive method for establishing an early and specific diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.

69,Panax notoginseng. an important herbal medicine. has wide uses for its bioactive compounds and health function. In this work. we compared the content of saponin in cultivation and adventitious root. The total content of saponins in adventitious root (8.48 mg.g(-1)) was found lower than in the native one (3-year-old) (34.34 mg.g(-1)). To enhance the content of bioactive compounds. we applied elicitors jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl dihydrojasmonate (MDJ) to the adventitious root culture. It was observed that the highest total content of saponins (71.94 mg.g(-1)) was achieved after treatment with 5 mg.L-1 JA. which was 2.09-fold higher than native roots and 8.45-fold higher than the control group. The findings from high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis showed that six new compounds were present after the treatment with the elicitors. Furthermore. we found that JA and MDJ significantly upregulated the expression of the geranyl diphosphate synthase. farnesyl diphosphate synthase. squalene synthase. squalene epoxidase. dammarenediol synthase. and CYP716A47 and CYP716A53v2 (CYP450 enzyme) genes; downregulated the expression of the cycloartenol synthase gene; and increased superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities.

70,Bioactive antioxidant peptides are more and more attracting the attention of food manufacturers for their potential to transform food in functional food. able to prevent a variety of chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress. In the present study proteins extracted from different vegetable sources (KAMUT (R) khorasan wheat. emmer. lupine and pea) were hydrolyzed with commercial enzymes and Lactobacillus spp. strains. Hydrolysates were separated by size exclusion chromatography and purified fractions were analyzed for their antioxidant activity. Peptides from the fractions with the highest activity were identified by nanoLC-ESI-QTOF-MS and thirteen peptides were selected for synthesis on the basis of their sequence. Four peptides (VLPPQQQY. TVTSLDLPVLRW. VTSLDLPVLRW. FVPY) were found able to scavenge superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals. organic nitro-radicals (ABTS. DPPH) and to inhibit lipid peroxidation. The impact of this work is targeted to add hydrolysed vegetable proteins to reformulated functional food or to produce health-promoting ingredients and nutraceuticals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

71,BackgroundThere are few studies on the association between nutrient intake and telomere length. which may reflect cumulative oxidative stress and indicate biological ageing. In the present study. we evaluated longitudinal associations between the consumption of micronutrients. including antioxidant nutrients and B vitamins involved in one-carbon transfer pathways. and leukocyte telomere length (LTL). MethodsThe study included 1958 middle-aged and older Korean men and women (age range at baseline: 40-69 years) from a population-based cohort. We collected dietary information at baseline using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (June 2001 to January 2003) and assessed the consumption of micronutrients. including vitamins A. B-1. B-2. B-3. B-6. B-9 (folate). C and E. as well as calcium. phosphorus. potassium. iron and zinc. We measured LTL using a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the 10-year follow-up examination (February 2011 to November 2012). ResultsIn the multiple regression model adjusted for potential confounders. LTL was positively associated with the consumption of vitamin C (P < 0.05). folate (P = 0.05) and potassium (P = 0.05) in all participants. In the age-stratified analysis. the association between the consumption of vitamin C (P < 0.01). folate (P < 0.05) and potassium (P < 0.05) with LTL was significant only among participants aged <50 years. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the earlier consumption of vitamin C. folate and potassium. which are abundant in fruits and vegetables. can delay biological ageing in middle-aged and older adults....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Senior Health
72,Rationale: Cigarette smoke extract inhibits chloride secretion in human bronchial epithelial cells. Oxidants decrease gene expression. protein expression. and function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Objectives: Because cigarette smoke is a rich source of oxidants. we verified the hypothesis that CFTR may be suppressed by exposure to cigarette smoke in vitro and in vivo. Methods: The effects of cigarette smoke exposure on Calu-3 and T84 cell CFTR expression and function were observed. Also studied were the nasal potential differences (PDs) in 26 men (9 smokers. 17 nonsmokers) who had no detectable CFTR gene mutations as determined during investigations for infertility. CFTR expression and function were determined by Northern blotting. Western blotting. and cAMP-dependent I-125 efflux assays. Extensive CFTR genotyping was performed in each subject. Nasal PD measurements were made at baseline and during amiloride. chloride-free buffer. and isoproterenol perfusions. Main Results: Cigarette smoke decreased CFTR expression and function in Calu-3 and T84 cell lines. Furthermore. the nasal PDs of cigarette smokers showed a pattern typical of CFTR deficiency with a blunted response to chloride-free buffer and isoproterenol compared with nonsmokers (-9.6 +/- 4.0 vs. -22.3 +/- 10.1 mV; p < 0.001). Conclusions: We conclude that cigarette smoke decreases the expression of CFTR gene. protein. and function in vitro and that acquired CFTR deficiency occurs in the nasal respiratory epithelium of cigarette smokers. We suggest that acquired CFTR deficiency may contribute to the physiopathology of cigarette-induced diseases such as chronic bronchitis....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
73,AIM: To investigate the molecular mechanism and functional consequences of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activation by lansoprazole in endothelial cells and macrophages. METHODS: Expression of HO-1 mRNA was analyzed by Northern blotting. Western blotting was used to determine the HO-1 and ferritin protein levels. NADPH-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation was measured with lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence. HO-1 promoter activity in mouse fibroblasts. stably transfected with a 15-kb HO-1 gene that drives expression of the reporter gene luciferase. was assessed using in vivo bioluminescence imaging. RESULTS: Lansoprazole increased HO-1 mRNA levels in endothelial cells and HO-1 protein levels in macrophages. In addition. lansoprazole-induced ferritin protein levels in both cell systems. Moreover. induction of the antioxidant proteins HO-1 and ferritin by lansoprazole was followed by a decrease in NADPH-mediated ROS formation. The radical scavenging properties of lansoprazole were diminished in the presence of the HO inhibitor. chromium mesoporphyrin IX. Induction of HO-1 gene expression by lansoprazole was not related to oxidative stress or to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. However. the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of HO-1 mRNA and promoter activity. CONCLUSION: Activation of HO-1 and ferritin may account for the gastric protection of lansoprazole and is dependent on a pathway blocked by LY294002. (C) 2009 The WIG Press and Baishideng.

74,Plasma gelsolin (pGSN) is a multifunctional protein involved mainly in severing and clearing of actin filaments. Its level correlates with inflammation and several diseases making it a potential biomarker of diagnostic and prognostic values. The pGSN level in groups of treated and untreated HIV-1-infected Indian patients is investigated in this study. This study aims at investigating the levels of pGSN in HIV-1-infected patients across different age. sex. severity of disease. and treatment status. Blood samples of 213 patients were analyzed for CD4 counts by flow cytometry and pGSN was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The level of pGSN is significantly increased in HIV-1 infected patients (227.2 +/- 54.3g/ml) compared to healthy volunteers (167.9 +/- 61.8g/ml). The level correlates with CD4 cell counts as patients with lower CD4 counts showed higher pGSN levels and vice versa. Gender does not affect pGSN level; however. antiretroviral (ARV) treatment reduces pGSN toward normal. Within low CD4 cell count group. the untreated patients have 52% higher pGSN than healthy volunteers. whereas with treatment. the difference reduces to 24%. Similarly. high CD4 cell count (>350 cells/mm(3)) group of patients showed 44% increase in pGSN in untreated patients compared to 21% increase in treated patients. There is an upregulation of pGSN in HIV-1 infection and it is inversely correlated with CD4 cell counts. Treatment with ARV drugs decreases pGSN levels toward normal. The monitoring of pGSN level in HIV-1-infected patients could be an important indicator of severity of disease and recovery during treatment....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,HIV/AIDS

77,Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a serious complication associated with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is widely used prior to allo-HCT for GVHD prevention. though evidence of its efficacy remains unclear. We therefore identified nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs). enrolling 1089 patients (554 in the ATG group and 535 in the non-ATG group) to conduct a meta-analysis of the actions of ATG in allo-HCT. A relative risk or risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each outcome. Rabbit ATG reduced overall acute (a) GVHD (RR 0.77. 95% CI 0.67-0.89. P = 0.0004). grade III-IV aGVHD (RR 0.53. 95% CI 0.32-0.88. P = 0.01). overall chronic (c) GVHD (RR 0.52. 95% CI 0.42-0.64. P < 0.00001) and extensive cGVHD (RR 0.28. 95% CI 0.180.43. P < 0.00001). without increased risk of relapse (RR 1.17. 95% CI 0.91-1.49. P = 0.23). By contrast. horse ATG did not reduce overall aGVHD (RR 1.25. 95% CI 0.88-1.79. P = 0.22) or cGVHD (RR 1.67. 95% CI 0.96-2.91. P = 0.07). ATG marginally reduced 100-day transplant related mortality (RR 0.75. 95% CI 0.56-1.00. P = 0.05) without compromising overall survival or increased risk of infections. Further studies are required to evaluate the optimal dosage and formulation of ATG in different conditioning regimens of transplantation with varied sources of graft and donor....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Atopic Dermatitis
78,We previously described a Dermacentor varibialis (DV) cDNA that encodes a ubiquitously expressed and tick saliva-secreted functional histamine release factor (HRF) homolog. In this study gene specific primers based on DVHRF open reading frame nucleotide sequence were utilized to amplify three orthologs. from the wood tick. D. andersoni (DA). the black legged tick. the southern cattle tick. Boophilus microplus (BM) and the lone star tick. Amblyomma americanum (AA). At nucleotide level. sequence comparisons revealed 98 89 and 84% similarity to DVHRF for DAHRF. AAHRF and BMHRF. respectively. while predicted polypeptide comparisons revealed 98. 96 and 91% similarity for DAHRF. AAHRF and BMHRF respectively. Phylogenetically. the tick HRF clade. while distinct (100% bootstrap value). is closely related to other arthropods. but distantly related to vertebrate and protozoan clades. Consistent with sequence similarity analysis. a DVHRF-specific northern blotting probe hybridized a similar to 900 base pair (bp) mRNA band on all RNA blots. Likewise a mouse polyclonal antibody to E. coli-expressed recombinant (r) DVHRF. cross-reacted baculovirus-expressed non-fusion rAAHRF. rDAHRF. and rBMHRF. As revealed by northern blotting analysis of larvae and nymph RNA. DVHRF mRNA is expressed in both immature and mature ticks indicating that its transcription is not developmentally regulated. Unlike rHRF/TCTP proteins of other organisms. the calcium-binding function may not be conserved for tick HRF homologs as revealed by the (CaCl2)-Ca-45 + overlay assay. Apparent global expression of DVHRF and its orthologs make this protein family an ideal target antigen for development of novel tick control strategies targeting multiple tick species....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Immunology
79,Purpose of review Aciclovir (ACV) is the first-line drug for the management of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections. Long-term administration of ACV for the treatment of severe infections in immunocompromised patients can lead to the development of drug resistance. Furthermore. the emergence of isolates resistant to ACV is increasingly recognized in immunocompetent individuals with herpetic keratitis. This review describes the mechanisms involved in drug resistance for HSV and VZV. the laboratory diagnosis and management of patients with infections refractory to ACV therapy. Recent findings Genotypic testing is more frequently performed for the diagnosis of infections caused by drug-resistant HSV or VZV isolates. Molecular biology-based systems for the generation of recombinant viruses have been developed to link unknown mutations with their drug phenotypes. Fast and sensitive methods based on next-generation sequencing will improve the detection of heterogeneous viral populations of drug-resistant viruses and their temporal changes during antiviral therapy. which could allow better patient management. Novel promising compounds acting on targets that differ from the viral DNA polymerase are under clinical development. Summary Antiviral drug resistance monitoring for HSV and VZV is required for a rational use of antiviral therapy in high-risk populations....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,HIV/AIDS

82,BackgroundHigh levels of maltreatment are found in children who are identified because their parents visit the emergency department due to partner violence. substance abuse or suicide attempt. However. it is unknown if these children experience psychosocial problems. This study aims to assess their levels of post-traumatic stress. anxiety. depression. behavioural problems and health-related quality of life. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in six hospitals. All consecutive families of which a parent visited the emergency department due to partner violence. substance abuse or suicide attempt between 1 July 2012 and 1 March 2014 with children aged 1.5-17years were approached for participation. Parents and children aged 8years and older filled out questionnaires measuring post-traumatic stress [13-item version of Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-13)]. anxiety. depression (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale). behavioural problems [Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report (YSR)] and health-related quality of life (PedsQL). Scores of participants were compared with reference data obtained in children in similar age ranges from representative Dutch community samples (CRIES-13. Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale. PedsQL and CBCL) and to a normed cutoff score (CRIES-13). ResultsOf 195 eligible families. 89 (46%) participated in the study. Participating children did not score different from community children. both on child-reported and parent-reported instruments. Standardized mean differences of total sum scores were 0 (CRIES-13 and CBCL 1.5-5). 0.1 (YSR). 0.2 (CBCL 6-18) and -0.3 (PedsQL) and not statistically different from community children. Thirty-five percent of the participating children scored above the cutoff score on the CRIES-13. indicating post-traumatic stress disorder. but this difference was not statistically significant from community children (mean difference 8%; 95% CI -4-22%). ConclusionsWe found no differences in psychosocial problems between children whose parents visited the emergency department due to partner violence. substance abuse or suicide attempt and children from community samples. Because 35% of the children scored in the range of post-traumatic stress disorder. we advise healthcare providers to pay attention to post-traumatic stress symptoms...,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Children's Health
83,There is increasing interest in describing different variants and subtypes that characterize the heterogeneity of behavior. problems with the aim of supporting early detection and prevention. as well as facilitating research into etiological differences. This work examines the course of co-occurrence of callous-unemotional traits (CU). anxiety (ANX) and oppositionality (ODD-s) levels in a longitudinal community sample. A sample of 622 3 year-old preschoolers. followed up until age 7. was assessed annually with dimensional measures of callous-unemotional traits. oppositional defiant disorder and anxiety and related psychological constructs answered by parents. teachers and. performed by children. Growth-Mixture-Modeling yielded six trajectories (null 58.9%. ANXincreasing 4.9%. CU + ANX + ODD 2.4%. CU + ODD-decreasing 8.1%. ODD-increasing 16.4%. and ANX-decreasing 9.2%) that represent the variants previously described with older subjects. The specifier ODD "with limited prosocial emotion" (CU + ODD decreasing and increasing) showed deficits in executive functioning. attention. aggressive behavior and social cognition in comparison with null trajectory. The secondary variant showed a more severe clinical picture and presented more difficulties in executive functioning. worse environmental characteristics. and worse outcomes at age 7. It is possible to identify the heterogeneity of disruptive behavior problems from preschool age. The identification of homogeneous groups in this category of disorders may help to design more suitable treatments with specific components for specific difficulties. and to progress in the etiological research of each class.

84,Background: Psychosocial distress is common among cancer patients. Significant associations between coping and social support with distress and quality of life in adult cancer patients have been identified before. but little is known about the interrelationships between distress. medical coping. and social support in adolescents and young adults (AYAs). Objective: The aims of this study are to investigate the prevalence of psychological distress in Chinese AYAs with cancer and examine the associations among distress. anxiety and depression. medical coping. and social support in the same population. Methods: A total of 610 AYA patients were recruited for this study; 551 patients completed the Chinese version of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer (DT). the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. the Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire. and the Social Support Rating Scale. Results: The prevalence of psychological distress was 89.1% in Chinese AYAs with cancer. The DT scores were the highest in the 21-to 25-year-old patients; the DT scores were positively correlated with anxiety and depression (PG. 01) but negatively correlated with medical coping and social support (PG. 01). Conclusion: The prevalence of psychological distress in AYA cancer patients was higher than that in the general cancer population. Medical coping and social support can lower the prevalence of psychological distress in AYA cancer patients. Implications for Practice: Findings suggest the need for evidence-based intervention strategies to enhance medical coping and social support in AYA cancer patients. Nurses are crucial to implementing psychological interventions in AYA cancer patients....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Mental Health
85,This study identified predictors of anxiety and depression in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Predictors included illness beliefs. fear/threat at the time of the cardiac event. threat reappraisal over time and social support. A total of 97 participants completed questionnaires in hospital and 1- and 6-month follow-up. Perceived threat and fear at the time of the cardiac event predicted affective response at both time points. partly mediated by threat reappraisal. Contemporaneous measures of illness beliefs contributed additional variance. although not always in the predicted direction: high concern and control over the illness were associated with emotional distress. Assessment of patients for risk of negative emotional outcomes of acute coronary syndrome needs to consider their beliefs about their illness and the degree of threat and fear experienced at the time of the event. Interventions need to help people cope with negative emotional states as well as challenging inappropriate illness beliefs....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Anxiety
86,The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a home-based (HB) exercise program on anxiety levels and metabolic functions in patients with anxiety disorders in Taiwan. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 86 participants for this randomized. experimental study. Participants were asked to complete a pretest before the 3-month exercise program. a posttest at 1 week. and a follow-up test at 3 months after the exercise program. Study measures included four Self-Report Scales and biophysical assessments to collect and assess personal data. lifestyle behaviors. anxiety levels. and metabolic control functions. Of the 86 study participants. 83 completed the posttest and the 3-month follow-up test. including 41 in the experimental group and 42 in the control group. Participants in the experimental group showed significant improvements in body mass index. high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. and the level of moderate exercise after the program relative to the control group. as analyzed by generalized estimating equations mixed-model repeated measures. State and trait anxiety levels were also significantly improved from pretest to follow-up test in the experimental group. Finally. the prevalence of metabolic syndrome declined for participants in the experimental group. The HB exercise program produced positive effects on the metabolic indicators and anxiety levels of Taiwanese adults with anxiety disorders. Health providers should consider using similar HB exercise programs to help improve the mental and physical health of patients with anxiety disorders in their communities....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Anxiety
87,Research shows that anxiety may relate to any or all of the following: goal conflict resolution; distraction. and the automatic detection of threat-related stimuli. To investigate these relationships we used a modified Stroop task where fearful and happy emotional target faces are overlaid with either emotionally neutral. emotionally congruent or emotionally incongruent distracting words. A trait anxiety related speed-accuracy trade-off seemed to primarily reduce accuracy during incongruent trials with target fearful faces overlaid with the emotionally conflicting word happy. We offer an explanation of this effect based upon theories of how positive stimuli and threat-related stimuli differentially affect information processing. Future studies should seek to verify how the anxiety related speed-accuracy trade-off mechanism is activated. and elucidate how and when positive stimuli affect anxiety more than threat-related stimuli do.

88,Context: Marine cyanobacteria offer a robust resource for natural products drug discovery due to the secondary metabolites they produce.Objective: To identify novel cyanobacterial compounds that exhibit CNS psychoactive effects.Materials and methods: Cyanobacteria were collected from Las Perlas Archipelago. Panama and subjected to dichloromethane/methanol extraction and fractionation by column chromatography before being screened for affinity against a panel of CNS targets. A 50:50 ethyl acetate:methanol fraction of one cyanobacterial extract (2064H) was subjected to HPLC and the major peak was isolated (2064H3). At a dose of 20g per animal. 2064H and 2064H3 were tested in mice using behavioral assays that included the forced swim. open field and formalin tests.Results: 2064H was shown to bind to the serotonin 2C (5-HT2C) receptor. a known target for depression and pain treatment. 2064H showed 59.6% inhibition of binding of [H-3]-mesulergine with an IC50 value of 179ng/mL and did not show inhibition of binding greater than 45% with any other receptors tested. Both 2064H and 2064H3 decreased immobility time in the first minute of the tail suspension test. 2064H increased time. distance and number of entries in the center region in the first half of the open field test. 2064H increased overall nocifensive behaviors in the formalin test.Discussion and conclusion: Overall. manipulating the 5-HT2C receptor with these receptor-specific ligands derived from cyanobacteria altered pain. depression and anxiety-like behaviors. illustrating the importance of this receptor in affective behaviors. These results demonstrate the potential of cyanobacteria as a source for CNS active compounds....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Depression
89,Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder are common in fibromyalgia patients. This study compared post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in fibromyalgia patients and healthy controls and determined whether patient-control differences in post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms mediated differences in mental health. In all. 30 patients and 30 healthy controls completed questionnaires assessing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and mental health. Fibromyalgia patients had greater symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and mental health than controls. Patient-control differences in mental health symptoms were fully or partially mediated by differences in post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Healthcare providers should understand the role of trauma as management of trauma symptoms may be one strategy for improving mental health....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Mental Health
90,Monitoring distress assessment in cancer patients during the treatment phase is a component of good quality care practice. Yet. there is a dearth of prospective studies examining distress. In an attempt to begin filling this gap and inform clinical practice. we conducted a prospective. longitudinal study examining changes in distress (anxiety. depression. and problems in living) by age and gender and the roles of age and gender in predicting distress. Newly diagnosed Brazilian cancer patients (N = 548) were assessed at three time points during chemotherapy. Age and gender were identified on the first day of chemotherapy (T1); anxiety. depression. and problems in living were self-reported at T1. the planned midway point (T2). and the last day of chemotherapy (T3). At T1. 37 and 17% of patients reported clinically significant levels of anxiety and depression. respectively. At T3. the prevalence was reduced to 4.6% for anxiety and 5.1% for depression (p70 years (p < .03). Female patients reported greater emotional. physical. and family problems than their male counterparts (p < .04). For most patients. elevated levels of distress noted in the beginning of treatment subsided by the time of treatment completion. However. middle-aged and female patients continued to report heightened distress. Evidence-based psychosocial intervention offered to at risk patients during early phases of the treatment may provide distress relief and improve outcomes over the illness trajectory while preventing psychosocial and physical morbidity due to untreated chronic distress....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Cancer
91,Individuals with high levels of worry are more likely than others to attend to possible threats. although the extent of top-down attentional control processes on this bias is unknown. We compared the performance of high (n = 26) and low worriers (n = 26) on a probe discrimination task designed to assess attention to threat cues. under cognitive load or no-load conditions. The expected difference between groups was confirmed. with high worriers being more likely to attend to threat cues than low worriers. Importantly however. there were no significant effects involving condition (cognitive load vs. no-load). nor any significant association with self-perceived attentional control ability. These results suggest that pathological worriers are more likely to attend to threat than are individuals with low levels of worry. regardless of task demands on limited cognitive control resources. This finding is consistent with the dominance of habitual bottom-up influences over top-down control processes in biased attention to threat....,Psychology,Psychology,Attention,Attention
92,Cognitive models of anxiety propose that heightened anxiety vulnerability is characterized by a tendency to interpret ambiguous situations as threatening. The presence of such an interpretive bias has been confirmed in younger adults. using assessment measures that bypass the limitations of self-report and objectively assess interpretive processing. A recent pioneering study published in 2015 has sought to determine whether this anxiety-linked interpretive bias also is evident in older adults. However. their evidence supporting this hypothesis comes only from self-report measures and memory measures. The present study was designed to provide a stronger test of the hypothesis by objectively assessing interpretive process in high (n = 48) and low (n = 48) trait anxious older adults. using a text comprehension approach that circumvents reliance on self-report or memory measures. The findings were fully consistent with the hypothesis that older adults with higher levels of trait anxiety. compared to those with lower levels of trait anxiety. impose more threatening meanings on ambiguous information. These findings provide the first evidence. from an assessment approach that overcomes the limitations of self-report and memory measures. that elevated anxiety vulnerability in older adults is characterized by a negative interpretive bias....,Psychology,Psychology,Attention,Social cognition
93,Extensive studies have reported cognitive abnormalities in neurodevelopmental disorders. such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Another line of evidence suggests that stress also affects cognitive functions. In this study. we investigated whether there were associations between stress hormones and cognitive functions in ASD and typically developing (TD) children. Cognitive functions in ASD and TD children were evaluated with a battery of psychological tests for working memory. behavioral flexibility. and social cognition for emotional assessments of others. ASD children exhibited higher hair and salivary cortisol. which reflects chronic and acute stress hormone levels of subjects. respectively. than TD children. Autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) was positively correlated with hair cortisol and the scores of Spence Children's Anxiety Scale in ASD children. In addition. a negative correlation was present between spatial working memory performance and hair cortisol in ASD. but not in TD. children. These results suggest that chronic stress hormone elevation may have relationships with some aspects of cognitive dysfunction in ASD subjects. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

94,According to Attachment Theory (Bowlby. 1980). individual differences in adult attachment styles are based on attachments formed during infancy with primary caregivers. Adults who form secure attachments feel safe and secure in their relationships. Those who form insecure attachments do not. According to Self-Compassion Theory (Neff. 2003a. 2003b). and supported by research. self-compassion (i.e.. compassionate attitudes and behaviors towards oneself) is associated with a variety. of positive psychological outcomes. while a lack of self-compassion is associated with psychological distress (e.g.. Barnard & Curry. 2011). Additionally. the fear of self-compassion has been negatively associated with self-compassion (Joeng.& Turner. 2015). In this current study. we extend the research on attachment and self-compassion by examining how self-compassion and fear of self-compassion mediate two types of insecure attachment styles. anxious attachment and avoidant attachment. and two indicators of emotional distress. depression and anxiety. among 473 Korean college students. Structural equation modeling indicated that self-compassion independently mediated. and fear of self-compassion and self-compassion serially mediated. the paths from anxious and avoidant attachment to depression and anxiety in expected directions. Results are interpreted from the perspective of Korean culture. including the influence of Confucianism on the expression of self-compassion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

95,Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2S (UBE2S). a family of E2 protein in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. is highly expressed in several types of cancers; however. its roles in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have not yet been well elucidated. The purpose of this study was to clarify the functional activities of UBE2S in OSCCs. We analyzed the expression levels of UBE2S in nine OSCC cell lines and primary OSCC tissues by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Western blotting. and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The correlations between UBE2S expression and clinical classifications of OSCCs were analyzed using the IHC scoring system. We also used UBE2S knockdown OSCC cells for functional assays (proliferation assay. flow cytometry. and Western blotting). UBE2S was overexpressed in OSCCs in vitro and in vivo and was correlated significantly (P < 0.05) with the primary tumoral size. The cellular growth was decreased and the cell-cycle was arrested in the G2/M phase in the UBE2S knockdown (shUBE2S) cells. The expression level of P21. a target of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. was increased in the shUBE2S cells because of lower anaphase activity that promotes complex subunit 3 (APC3). an E3 ubiquitin ligase. compared with shMock cells. These findings might promote the understanding of the relationship between UBE2S overexpression and oral cancer proliferation. indicating that UBE2S would be a potential biomarker of and therapeutic target in OSCCs.

96,Objective: To detect the distribution and expression levels of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and the absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasomes in periapical lesions and to analyse the possible microbial stimuli outside of teeth. Design: The distribution of NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes in sixteen periapical lesions was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Meanwhile. the relative gene expression levels of NLRP3 and AIM2 in sixteen periapical lesions and three health periodontal tissue were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Moreover. forty-seven teeth without sinus tracts were obtained in the clinic and included in bacterial analysis using PCR. Then. the mRNA levels of apoptosis-associated speck like protein (ASC). caspase-1. interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). NLRP3 and AIM2 in THP-1-derived macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Porphyromonas were also quantified by real-time PCR. and the IL-1 beta secretion level was investigated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: NLRP3 and AIM2 were positively expressed in periapical lesions and were mainly distributed in inflammatory cells. Most of the samples that demonstrated up-regulation of NLRP3 mRNA also demonstrated up-regulation of caspase-1 mRNA. Microbial analysis revealed that Porphyromonas endodontalis was the most commonly detected species and was detected in 27 of 47 cases (57.4%). followed by Fusobacterium nucleatum (20/47. 42.6%). Porphyromonas gingivalis (19/47. 40.4%). Tannerella forsythia (19/47. 40.4%). Actinomyces sp. (17/47. 36.17%). Treponema denticola (10/47.21.28%). Actinomyces israelii (9/47.19.15%). Prevotella intermedia (6/47. 12.77%). Enterococcus faecalis (1/47.2.13%) and Enterococcus faecium (0/47.0). Furthermore. we found that LPS of P. gingivalis induced THP-1 cells to produce IL-1 beta and to activate NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the NLRP3 and AIM2 proteins play a part in the pathogenesis of periapical periodontitis. Anaerobes. such as P. endodontalis. P. gingivalis. E nucleatum and T. forsythia. were the main detected microbial stimuli that might activate inflammasomes in periapical tissues. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

97,Aims: Ligands for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) regulate apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. The vitamin D metabolite 24. 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (24. 25-(OH)(2)D(3)) has been shown to possess unique biological effects. To determine if 24. 25-(OH)(2)D(3) modulates apo A-I gene expression. HepG2 hepatocytes and Caco-2 intestinal cells were treated with 24. 25-(OH)(2)D(3) or its precursor 25-OHD(3). Main methods: Apo A-I protein levels and mRNA levels were measured by Western and Northern blotting. respectively. Changes in apo A-I promoter activity were measured using the chlorampenicol acetytransferase assay. Key findings: Treatment with 24. 25-(OH)(2)D(3). but not 25-OHD(3). inhibited apo A-I secretion in HepG2 and Caco-2 cells and apo A-I mRNA levels and apo A-I promoter activity in HepG2 cells. To determine if 24. 25(OH)(2)D(3) represses apo A-I gene expression through site A. the nuclear receptor binding element that is essential for VDRs effects on apo A-I gene expression. HepG2 cells were transfected with plasmids containing or lacking site A. While the site A-containing plasmid was suppressed by 24. 25-(OH)(2)D(3). the plasmid lacking site A was not. Likewise. treatment with 24. 25-(OH)(2)D(3) suppressed reporter gene expression in cells transfected with a plasmid containing site A in front of a heterologous promoter. Finally. antisense-mediated VDR depletion failed to reverse the silencing effects of 24. 25-(OH)(2)D(3) on apo A-I expression. Significance: These results suggest that the vitamin D metabolite 24. 25-(OH)(2)D(3) is an endogenous regulator of apo A-I synthesis through a VDR-independent signaling mechanism.

98,Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is predominantly a lipid transport protein involved in membrane repair and synaptic plasticity in brain. Its genotype is associated with late-onset sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its expression increases when any injury takes place in the nervous system and in age-related disorders including AD. However. it is not clearly understood how the level of apoE changes in the normal aging brain. Therefore. we have analyzed the effect of age on apoE protein and mRNA level in the cerebral cortex of young. adult. and old male AKR strain mice. Western. northern. and RT-PCR results reveal that the level of apoE protein and mRNA is higher in young as compared to adult and then remains unchanged in old mouse cerebral cortex. This indicates that during normal aging. apoE level is maintained in old similar to adult and suggests involvement of other factors in maintaining apoE-mediated brain functions in old....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Alzheimer's Disease
99,A critical process in apoptosis is the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). This process is known to be regulated by the multi-domain Bcl-2 family proteins. For example. the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak are responsible for forming pores at MOM. The anti-apoptotic proteins (including Bcl-2. Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL). on the other hand. can inhibit this pore-forming process. Interestingly. although these two subgroups of proteins perform opposite apoptotic functions. their structures are very similar. This raises two highly interesting questions: (1) Why do these structurally similar proteins play opposite roles in apoptosis? (2) What are the roles of different functional domains of a Bcl-2 family protein in determining its apoptotic property? In this study. we generated a series of deletion mutants and substitution chimera. and used a combination of molecular biology. bio-informatics and living cell imaging techniques to answer these questions. Our major findings are: (1) All of the Bcl-2 family proteins appear to possess an intrinsic pro-apoptotic property. (2) The N-termini of these proteins play an active role in suppressing their pro-apoptotic function. (3) The apoptotic potency is positively correlated with membrane affinity of the alpha 5/6 helix domains. (4) Charge distribution flanking the alpha 5/6 helices is also important for the apoptotic potency. These findings explain why different members of Bcl-2 family proteins with similar domain composition can function oppositely in the apoptotic process....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Cell biology
0,BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Degenerative disc disease (DDD) remains without an effective therapy and presents a costly burden to society. PURPOSE: Based upon prior reports concerning the effects of notochordal cell-conditioned medium (NCCM) on disc cells. we performed a proof of principle study to determine whether NCCM could reduce cytotoxic stress-induced apoptosis in human disc nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. STUDY DESIGN/ SETTING: This is an "in vitro" fundamental or basic science study. METHODS: Nucleus pulpous cells derived from 15 patients undergoing spinal surgery were treated with interleukin (IL)-1 beta and Fas ligand or etoposide in the presence of NCCM. We determined proor antiapoptotic events using activated caspase assays and determined genomic regulation of apoptosis using polymerase chain reaction arrays validated usingWestern blotting methods. We interrogated cellular apoptotic regulation using JC-1 dye and flow cytometry and performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to evaluate NP inflammatory cytokine secretion. RESULTS: Notochordal cell-conditioned medium inhibits cytotoxic stress-induced caspase-9 and -3/7 activities and maintains the mitochondrial membrane potential in human NPcells. thereby suppressing the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Gene expression analysis revealed the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein as a key player responsible for evading etoposide-induced apoptosis in the presence ofNCCM. and we verified these data using Western blotting. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results revealed distinct differences in IL-6 and IL-8 secretions by NP cells in response to etoposide in the presence of NCCM. CONCLUSIONS: Here we demonstrate for the first time that NCCM reduces cytotoxic stressinduced apoptosis in human NP cells. Soluble factors present in NCCM could be harnessed for the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of DDD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

1,PCD (programmed cell death) is important mechanism for development. homeostasis and disease. To analyze the gene expression pattern in brain cells undergoing PCD in response to serum deprivation. we analyzed the cDNA microarray consisting of 2.300 genes and 7 housekeeping genes of cortical cells derived from mouse embryonic brain. Cortical cells were induced apoptosis by serum deprivation.for 8 hours. We identified 69 up-regulated genes and 21 down-regulated genes in apoptotic cells. Based on the cDNA microarray data four genes were selected and analyzed by RT-PCR and northern blotting. To characterize the role of UNC-51-like kinase (ULK2) gene in PCD. we investigated cell death effect by ULK2. And we examined expression of several genes that related with PCD. Especially GAPDH was increased by ULK2. Theses findings indicated that ULK2 is involved in apoptosis through p53 pathway....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Alzheimer's Disease
2,Background and Aim: The tumor-suppressing role of Ras-association domain family 1A (RASSF1A) has been described in several systems. In this study. we tested its tumor-suppressing ability and the potential molecular mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from Qidong County. Methods: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Northern blotting were employed to detect the expression of RASSF1A in HCC. After establishing stable RASSF1A (wild type or mutant) expressing 'qi dong gan ai yan jiu suo' ([Qidong Institute of Liver Cancer] QGY)-7703 cell lines. we tested the effects of RASSF1A expression on cell growth by cell proliferation rate. cell colony formation. and cell cycle progression. We also tested the effects of RASSF1A expression on tumorigenesis in nude mice and on cellular sensitivity to mitomycin treatment. Results: The RASSF1A transcript was not found in 75% (three of four) of HCC cell lines and 67% (32/48) of HCC primary biopsies. The stepwise regression analyses indicated that the loss of RASSF1A expression was more frequent in patients who were hepatitis B virus surface antigen positive (HBsAg+) compared to those who were HBsAg(-). both in tumor and corresponding non-cancerous tissues. The wild-type (wt)-RASSF1A expression in the QGY-7703 cell line resulted in fewer and smaller clones. decreased xenograft tumor volume and weight. and G(1)/S arrest in vitro and in vivo. The wt-RASSF1A expression also decreased the cyclin D1 protein expression. which appeared to be at the level of post-transcriptional control. In addition. the wt-RASSF1A expression increased cell growth inhibition and the percentage of cells with sub-G(1) DNA content when the cells were treated with mitomycin. Conclusion: RASSF1A is a tumor suppressor in HCC. The loss of RASSF1A expression may be related to HBsAg+ in hepatocarcinogenesis. Its inactivation may play an important role in the development of HCC....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Cancer
3,Background: Neutrophil function is critical for initiation and progression of infecto-inflammatory diseases. Key quorum-sensing plaque bacteria. such as Fusobacterium nucleatum. act as bridging species between early and late colonizer pathogens. such as Porphyromonas gingivalis. as the biofilm ages and periodontal inflammation increases. This study is designed to determine impact of different F. nucleatum strains on neutrophil function. Methods: Cells of human promyelocytic leukemia cell line-60 were differentiated into neutrophil-like cells and cultured with F. nucleatum strains of subspecies (ssp.) nucleatum ATCC 25586. ssp. polymorphum ATCC 10953. and ssp. vincentii ATCC 49256. Neutrophil phagocytosis of F. nucleatum strains and neutrophil apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Superoxide generation was measured by cytochrome C reduction in the presence and absence of N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) (1 mu M) stimulation. Proinflammatory cytokine release was determined after 2. 6. and 24 hours of culture in the presence/absence of different F. nucleatum strains. Expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2. TLR4. and nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B mRNA levels were analyzed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Each experiment was repeated at least three times in triplicate. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance followed by post hoc Bonferroni correction. Results: All strains of F. nucleatum significantly increased phagocytic capacity of neutrophils. Neutrophil phagocytosis of F. nucleatum ssp. polymorphum was significantly greater than that of F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii and ssp. nucleatum (P < 0.001). F. nucleatum ssp. nucleatum and ssp. polymorphum significantly blocked fMLP-induced superoxide generation (P < 0.001). Although F. nucleatum vincentii also reduced superoxide generation (25%). the impact was not as strong as that of ssp. nucleatum (83%) and ssp. polymorphum (100%). All F. nucleatum strains stimulated significant increase in neutrophil apoptosis compared with control (P < 0.001) and significantly increased expression of NF-B-k mRNA in neutrophils (P < 0.05). Levels of interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha produced by neutrophils were significantly increased in all F. nucleatum groups compared with control (P < 0.001). Conclusions: These findings suggest that different strains of F. nucleatum impact neutrophil function in different ways. Two of three subspecies blocked neutrophil superoxide generation in response to a secondary stimulus. preventing oxidative killing by neutrophils. The direct role of bridging species in pathogenesis of periodontitis may be greater than previously suspected in which they create a favorable environment for pathogenic transition of the dental ecosystem....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
4,Background/Aims: High-glucose (HG)-induced mesangial apoptosis and fibrogenesis possibly involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and activated mitochondrial stress. We investigated the therapeutic effect of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on cellular apoptosis and matrix accumulation in HG-treated rat mesangial cells (RMCs). Methods: RMCs were cultured in media containing 5 (control) or 35 m M (HG) glucose. Cellular apoptosis was assayed by TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining. Collagen and transforming growth factor-1 gene expression were measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction or Northern blotting. Mitochondrial capacity and intracellular ROS generation was assayed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. respectively. Cellular ATP production and malondialdehyde (MDA) formation were determined by a luciferin-luciferase reaction and high-performance liquid chromatography. respectively. Cytochrome c release. caspase activation and poly(ADP) ribose polymerase cleavage were assayed by Western blotting. Results: HG-treated RMCs displayed enhanced cellular apoptosis (65%) and collagen gene expression (1.8-fold increase); these reactions could be significantly suppressed by 1 m M NAC (p < 0.05). Intracellular ROS generation. production of ATP and MDA. and caspase-3. -8 and -9 activities were significantly increased in HG-treated RMCs. and were effectively attenuated by addition of NAC. Conclusion: It is concluded that NAC prevents HG-induced mesangial apoptosis and fibrogenesis pathways by the reduction of oxidative stress. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG.

5,Background: Many microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been shown to demonstrate critical roles in differentiation. proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Methods and Results: In this study. a certain amount of miRNA expression in VSMCs was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. and it was found that microRNA-30e (miR-30e) was expressed more strongly than other common vascular well-expressed miRNAs in vitro. Subsequently. both a gain and loss of function study was performed in vitro and in vivo. It was found that miR-30e in VSMCs was strongly downregulated concomitantly with stimulation. and miR-30e inhibited VSMCs proliferation and migration both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore. ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2I (Ube2i) was identified as the target gene of endogenous miR-30e by luciferase reporter assay. and it was confirmed that overexpression of miR-30e significantly reduced Ube2i and inhibited the phenotypic switch of VSMCs. Knockdown of Ube2i had an influence over the proliferation and migration of cultured VSMCs. as same as the miR-30e mimic did. Overexpression of miR-30e induced the apoptosis of VSMCs and deregulated the protein expression of IkBa. which is crucial for the NF.B signal pathway. Conclusions: The results of this study indicated that miR-30e in VSMCs exerted an anti-atherosclerosis effect via inhibiting proliferation and migration. and promoting apoptosis of VSMCs. More specifically. it was demonstrated that miR-30e exhibited these effects on VSMCs partially through targeting Ube2i and downregulating the I kappa Ba/NF kappa B signaling pathway....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Heart Disease
6,Ascorbic acid plays an important role in the growth and immunity of the sea cucumber. Apostichopus japonicus. a valuable commercial species in China. South Korea. and Japan. In this study. we investigated the dietary ascorbic acid requirements of two newly discovered color morphs of A. japonicus. white and purple. and compared them with that of the common green morph. Six test diets were formulated containing 0. 50. 100. 200. 400. and 800 mg ascorbic acid equivalent per kg. as 1-ascorbyl-2-polyphosphate. The color morphs were fed the test diets for 60 days. and their growth. energy budget. and immunological performance recorded. Dietary ascorbic acid levels had a significant effect on the growth of A. japonicus (P= 200 mg/kg (P < 0.05). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. and total anti-oxidative capacity (T-AOC) were generally higher at dietary ascorbic acid levels of 100. 200. and 400 mg/kg compared with the other treatments. SOD and CAT activities and T-AOC were significantly and positively correlated with SGR. indicating that supplementary dietary ascorbic acid had a beneficial effect on growth and immunity.

Immune indicators decreased and MDA content increased slightly at 800 mg/kg. indicating that high levels of dietary ascorbic acid do not benefit growth or immunity. The SOD and CAT activities were higher in the purple morph than the green and white morphs. indicatingits superior immune system capacity. Optimum growth and immunity of A. japonicus were achieved at similar to 100 mg/kg of ascorbic acid in the white morph and 200 mg/kg in the green and purple morphs....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Immunology,Immunology
7,Background: Appendiceal cancers are rare and consist of carcinoid. mucocele. pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). goblet cell carcinoma. lymphoma. and adenocarcinoma histologies. Current treatment involves surgical resection or debulking. but no standard exists for adjuvant chemotherapy or treatment for metastatic disease. Methods: Samples were identified from approximately 60.000 global tumors analyzed at a referral molecular profiling CLIA-certified laboratory. A total of 588 samples with appendix primary tumor sites were identified (male/female ratio of 2: 3; mean age =55). Sixty-two percent of samples were adenocarcinomas (used for analysis); the rest consisted of 9% goblet cell. 15% mucinous; 6% pseudomyxoma. and less than 5% carcinoids and 2% neuroendocrine. Tests included sequencing [Sanger. next generation sequencing (NGS)]. protein expression/ immunohistochemistry (IHC). and gene amplification [fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or CISH]. Results: Profiling across all appendiceal cancer histological subtypes for IHC revealed: 97% BRCP. 81% MRP1. 81% COX-2. 71% MGMT. 56% TOPO1. 5% PTEN. 52% EGFR. 40% ERCC1. 38% SPARC. 35% PDGFR. 35% TOPO2A. 25% RRM1. 21% TS. 16% cKIT. and 12% for TLE3. NGS revealed mutations in the following genes: 50.4% KRAS. 21.9% P53. 17.6% GNAS. 16.5% SMAD4. 10% APC. 7.5% ATM. 5.5% PIK3CA. 5.0% FBXW7. and 1.8% BRAF. Conclusions: Appendiceal cancers show considerable heterogeneity with high levels of drug resistance proteins (BCRP and MRP1). which highlight the difficulty in treating these tumors and suggest an individualized approach to treatment. The incidence of low TS (79%) could be used as a backbone of therapy (using inhibitors such as 5FU/capecitabine or newer agents). Therapeutic options includeTOPO1 inhibitors (irinotecan/topotecan). EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib. cetuximab). PDGFR antagonists (regorafenib. axitinib). MGMT (temozolomide). Clinical trials targeting pathways involving KRAS. p53. GNAS. SMAD4. APC. ATM. PIK3CA. FBXW7. and BRAF may be also considered. Overall. appendiceal cancers have similar patterns in their molecular profile to pancreatic cancers (can we say this. any statistical analysis done?) and have differential expression from colorectal cancers. These findings indicate the need to evaluate patient samples for patterns in marker expression and alteration. in order to better understand the molecular biology and formulate a personalized therapy approach in these difficult to treat cancers (supported by a grant from Caris Life Sciences)....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
8,Background and aims: Apple polyphenol contains abundant procyanidins. which have been associated with an anti-atherosclerosis and cholesterol-lowering effect. The aim of this study was to investigate whether apple procyanidins (APCs) feature therapeutic efficacy in terms of regressing atherosclerosis and whether this efficacy is due to mechanisms other than a cholesterol-lowering effect. Methods: After eight weeks on an atherogenic diet. rabbits were given a normal diet for another eight weeks to normalize the increased serum lipids level. The rabbits in the baseline group were sacrificed at this stage. The control group was subsequently fed a normal diet for eight weeks. while the APCs group was administrated 50 mg/kg/day of APCs in addition to the normal diet. Serum lipids and aortic intimal-medial thickness (IMT) were serially examined. and the resected aorta was examined histologically and through molecular biology. Results: Aortic IMT on ultrasonography and the lipid accumulation area examined using Sudan IV staining were significantly reduced in the APCs group as compared to the control group. Serum lipid profiles were not different between the groups. Immunohistochemistry showed significantly decreased staining of an oxidative stress marker and significantly increased staining of ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) in the APCs group. Western blotting and RT-PCR also showed increased expression of ABCA1 mRNA and its protein in the APCs group. Conclusions: This study revealed that APCs administration causes a regression of atherosclerosis. APCs might hold promise as an anti-atherosclerotic agent. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

9,Apples are a widely consumed fruit and have a high polyphenol content. The aim of this study was to analyse the combined effects of osmotic dehydration (OD) and ohmic heating (OH) with a pulsed vacuum (PV) on polyphenol retention during the stored refrigeration of apple cubes. Treatments were performed using a 65 degrees Brix sucrose solution at 30. 40 or 50 degrees C for 120 min. and then. samples were stored for 28 days at 5 degrees C. OH provides an electric field of 13 V cm(-1). and a pulsed vacuum was applied for 5 min at the beginning of the process. The results indicated that a lower temperature process (30-40 degrees C) resulted in the retention of more polyphenol compounds after treatment than a higher temperature process (50 degrees C). Nevertheless. during refrigerated storage. we observed that 50 degrees C preserved these compounds better due to polyphenol oxidase inactivation. PVOD/OH treatment at 50 degrees C was determined to be the best retention of polyphenols from the fresh apple for dehydrating apples....,ECE,biochemistry,Electricity,Human Metabolism
10,We developed a 2.5x6.6 mm(2) 2-D array transducer with integrated transmit/receive application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for real-time 3-D intracardiac echocardiography (4-D ICE) applications. The ASIC and transducer design were optimized so that the high-voltage transmit. low-voltage time-gain control and preamp. subaperture beamformer. and digital control circuits for each transducer element all fit within the 0.019-mm(2) area of the element. The transducer assembly was deployed in a 10-Fr (3.3-mm diameter) catheter. integrated with a GE Vivid E9 ultrasound imaging system. and evaluated in three preclinical studies. The 2-D image quality and imaging modes were comparable to commercial 2-D ICE catheters. The 4-D field of view was at least 90 degrees x 60 degrees x 8 cm and could be imaged at 30 vol/s. sufficient to visualize cardiac anatomy and other diagnostic and therapy catheters. 4-D ICE should significantly reduce X-ray fluoroscopy use and dose during electrophysiology ablation procedures. 4-D ICE may be able to replace transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). and the associated risks and costs of general anesthesia. for guidance of some structural heart procedures....,ECE,Medical,Digital control,Heart Disease
11,Animals domesticated for working closely with humans (e.g. dogs) have been shown to be remarkable in adjusting their behaviour to human attentional stance. However. there is little evidence for this form of information perception in species domesticated for production rather than companionship. We tested domestic ungulates (goats) for their ability to differentiate attentional states of humans. In the first experiment. we investigated the effect of body and head orientation of one human experimenter on approach behaviour by goats. Test subjects (N = 24) significantly changed their behaviour when the experimenter turned its back to the subjects. but did not take into account head orientation alone. In the second experiment. goats (N = 24) could choose to approach one of two experimenters. while only one was paying attention to them. Goats preferred to approach humans that oriented their body and head towards the subject. whereas head orientation alone had no effect on choice behaviour. In the third experiment. goats (N = 32) were transferred to a separate test arena and were rewarded for approaching two experimenters providing a food reward during training trials. In subsequent probe test trials. goats had to choose between the two experimenters differing in their attentional states. Like in Experiments 1 and 2. goats did not show a preference for the attentive person when the inattentive person turned her head away from the subject. In this last experiment. goats preferred to approach the attentive person compared to a person who closed their eyes or covered the whole face with a blind. However. goats showed no preference when one person covered only the eyes. Our results show that animals bred for production rather than companionship show differences in their approach and choice behaviour depending on human attentive state. However. our results contrast with previous findings regarding the use of the head orientation to attribute attention and show the importance of cross-validating results....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
12,Understanding verbal descriptions of everyday actions could involve the neural representation of action direction (avoidance and approach) toward persons and things. We recorded the electrophysiological activity of participants while they were reading approach/avoidance action sentences that were directed toward a target: a thing/a person (i.e.. "Petra accepted/rejected Ramn in her group"/ "Petra accepted/rejected the receipt of the bank"). We measured brain potentials time locked to the target word. In the case of things. we found a N400-like component with right frontal distribution modulated by approach/avoidance action. This component was more negative in avoidance than in approach sentences. In the case of persons. a later negative event-related potential (545-750 ms) with left frontal distribution was sensitive to verb direction. showing more negative amplitude for approach than avoidance actions. In addition. more negativity in approach-person sentences was associated with fear avoidance trait. whereas less negativity in avoidance-person sentences was associated with a greater approach trait. Our results support that verbal descriptions of approach/avoidance actions are encoded differently depending on whether the target is a thing or a person. Implications of these results for a social. emotional and motivational understanding of action language are discussed....,Psychology,Psychology,Attention,Social cognition
13,In this note. we propose symbolic models for networks of discrete-time nonlinear control systems. If each subsystem composing the network admits an incremental input-to-state stable Lyapunov function and if some small gain theorem-type conditions are satisfied. a network of symbolicmodels. each one associated with each subsystem composing the network. is proposed and shown to be approximately bisimilar to the original network with any desired accuracy....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Control engineering
14,Background: Approximate string matching is the problem of finding all factors of a given text that are at a distance at most k from a given pattern. Fixed-length approximate string matching is the problem of finding all factors of a text of length n that are at a distance at most k from any factor of length l of a pattern of length m. There exist bit-vector techniques to solve the fixed-length approximate string matching problem in time O(m [l/w]n) and space O(m [l/w] under the edit and Hamming distance models. where w is the size of the computer word; as such these techniques are independent of the distance threshold k or the alphabet size. Fixed-length approximate string matching is a generalisation of approximate string matching and. hence. has numerous direct applications in computational molecular biology and elsewhere. Results: We present and make available libFLASM. a free open-source C++ software library for solving fixed-length approximate string matching under both the edit and the Hamming distance models. Moreover we describe how fixed-length approximate string matching is applied to solve real problems by incorporating libFLASM into established applications for multiple circular sequence alignment as well as single and structured motif extraction. Specifically. we describe how it can be used to improve the accuracy of multiple circular sequence alignment in terms of the inferred likelihood-based phylogenies; and we also describe how it is used to efficiently find motifs in molecular sequences representing regulatory or functional regions. The comparison of the performance of the library to other algorithms show how it is competitive. especially with increasing distance thresholds. Conclusions: Fixed-length approximate string matching is a generalisation of the classic approximate string matching problem. We present libFLASM. a free open-source C++ software library for solving fixed-length approximate string matching. The extensive experimental results presented here suggest that other applications could benefit from using libFLASM. and thus further maintenance and development of libFLASM is desirable....,biochemistry,CS,Molecular biology,Bioinformatics
15,A high-efficiency method is proposed to suppress magnetic core imbalance in phase-shifted full-bridge (PSFB) converters. Compared with conventional solutions. such as controlling peak current mode (PCM) or adding DC blocking capacitance. the proposed method has several advantages. such as lower power loss and smaller size. because the additional current sensor or blocking capacitor is removed. A time domain model of the secondary side is built to analyze the relationship between transformer core imbalance and cathode voltage of secondary side rectifiers. An approximate control algorithm is designed to achieve asymmetric phase control. which reduces the effects of imbalance. A 60 V/15 A prototype is built to verify the proposed method. Experimental results show that the numerical difference of primary side peak currents between two adjacent cycles is suppressed from 2 A to approximately 0 A. Meanwhile. compared with the PCM solution. the efficiency of the PSFB converter is slightly improved from 93% to 93.2%....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
16,We investigated the changes in the expression profiles of the partially resistant apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) cultivar Goldrich following inoculation with Plum pox virus (PPV) using cDNA-amplification fragment length polymorphism. (AFLP). Altered expression patterns were detected and twenty-one differentially expressed cDNA had homologies with genes in databases coding for proteins involved in metabolism. signal transduction. defense. stress and intra/intercellular connections. Seven of the modified expressed patterns were further investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR or Northern blotting. The expression patterns of five of these genes were confirmed in the partially resistant P armeniaca cv. 'Goldrich' and assessed in a susceptible genotype. One of these cDNAs. coding for a putative class III chitinase. appeared to be repressed in infected plants of the partially resistant genotype and expressed in the susceptible one which could be related to the partially resistant phenotype. On the contrary. the expression patterns of the genes coding for a transketolase. a kinesin-like and an ankyrin-like protein. were clearly linked to the susceptible interaction. These candidate genes could play a role either in the compatible interaction leading to virus invasion or to the quantitative resistance of apricot to PPV (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

17,Some fruits have a reduced harvesting period or a high degree of perishability. which results in a very short shelf life. Therefore. in order to extend the shelf life of foodstuffs. maintaining low the level at which microbial spoilage and deterioration reactions can occur. fresh fruits have to be treated. obtaining semi-finished products. Those products are commonly used as starting materials by some food industries. like jams'. gelatines' and marmalades' ones. due to the extension of their productions throughout the whole year. Among the possible techniques. the Southern Italy industry under study uses three different techniques to produce. package and preserve semi-finished fruits: one based on individually quick freezing. one on low-pressure superheated steam drying with far-infrared radiation. and one on an ohmic aseptic treatment. In the last years. food industries have focused their attention not only towards high quality products but also towards environmental friendly productions. Therefore. the aim of this work is to use a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach to compare the environmental emissions of the three different production and preservation techniques used by the industry under study. The environmental impacts were evaluated using a detailed LCA analysis. normalizing all the consumptions and emissions to the functional unit (one apricots' kg on dry basis). Data were analysed using SimaPro 8.0.5 software. whereas the Ecoinvent database and information collected from the chosen industrial site were used for the life cycle inventory. according to the reference standard for LCA (i.e.. ISO 14040-14044). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved....,Psychology,biochemistry,Attention,Molecular biology
18,In this article we investigate if the Swedish consumer prices for electricity are adjusted equally fast regardless of whether the NordPool power market prices are decreased or increased. Due to relatively moderate variations in the variables. we have applied quantile regression. since it is mainly the large changes (above the median) that essentially tend to have a considerable effect on the consumer prices. Moreover. in order to adjust for stochastic- and deterministic trends. autocorrelation. structural breaks as well as to measure APT effects in the short- and in the medium-run. we apply a wavelet decomposition approach. Our results show evidence that significantly positive asymmetric price transmission (APT) effects exist in this market. More specifically. in the short-run (based on the wavelet decomposition D1 for 1-2 months cycles). we find that that there is a higher propensity to rapidly and systematically increase the consumer prices subsequently to an increase in the NordPool market price. compared with the propensity to decrease their customers prices subsequently to a corresponding drop in the NordPool market prices. However. no significant APT effects were detected in the medium- or in the long-run (i.e. the asymmetric price transmission effects are observed only in the short-run). In summary. we could isolate significant APT effects in the short-run (1-2 months decomposition cycles). and for large changes in the dependent variable (percentiles = 0.9). Therefore. only large changes in the NordPool prices lead to feedback effects in the form of asymmetric price transmission effects. Our evidence supports the notion of firms' downward stickiness of retail prices for maximizing profit. which are not expected to be found on a fully efficient market. Although our finding shows that the price inefficiency is short-lived. these large temporal inefficiencies are still costly for the consumers. It should be noted that blunt traditional powerless methods do not detect these APT effects. while our wavelet quantile methods are powerful and make a significant contribution in the literature by providing new empirical evidence....,ECE,MAE,Electricity,Machine design
19,DNA vaccines had been widely used in animal models against various viral infections. while it was not so convincing for many infectious diseases especially bacterial disease in aquaculture. Interleukin-8(IL-8) as one of the CXC chemokines. its immunological role and adjuvant potential which had been proved in mammals were rarely reported in fish species. In this study. recombination plasmid pcDNA3.1/IL-8(pcIL-8) was conducted and the capacity of IL-8 as molecular adjuvant was explored from several aspects by co-injecting with a DNA vaccine encoding a-enolase(pcENO) against Streptococcus iniae infection in channel catfish. The results suggested that co-injection of pcIL-8 with DNA vaccine increased the innate immunity and specific antibody levels. as well as increased the immune-related genes involving in pro-inflammatory response. humoral and cellular immunity. Moreover. pcIL-8 enhanced the immunoprotection of pcENO with the relative percent survival(RPS) of 60% to 80% against S. iniae infection at 4 week post vaccination(p.v.). with the significantly higher RPS of 73.33% in pcENO+pcIL-8 group compared with that of pcENO alone(53.33%) at challenge test of 8 weeks p.v. Taken together. these results indicate pcIL-8 as a molecular adjuvant co-injected with DNA vaccine not only improves the immunoprotection but also maintains long period of immunity for channel catfish against S. iniae infection. Our study signifies that IL-8 holds promise to serve as a potential adjuvant in DNA vaccines against bacterial infections for long time....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Alzheimer's Disease
20,Fish from aquaculture is becoming more important for human consumption. Sustainable aquaculture procedures were developed as an alternative to overcome the negative environmental impacts of conventional aquaculture procedures and wild fisheries. The objective of this contribution is to determine what consumers expect from sustainable aquaculture and whether they prefer sustainable aquaculture products. A combination of qualitative research methods. with think aloud protocols and in-depth interviews. as well as quantitative methods. using choice experiments and face-to-face interviews. was applied. Data was collected in three different cities of Germany. Results revealed that sustainable aquaculture was associated with natural. traditional. local. and small scale production systems with high animal welfare standards. Overall. participants paid a lot of attention to the declaration of origin; in particular fish products from Germany and Denmark were preferred along with local products. Frequently used sustainability claims for aquaculture products were mostly criticized as being imprecise by the participants of the qualitative study; even though two claims tested in the choice experiments had a significant positive impact on the choice of purchase. Similarly. existing aquaculture-specific labels for certified sustainable aquaculture had an impact on the buying decision. but were not well recognized and even less trusted. Overall. consumers had a positive attitude towards sustainable aquaculture. However. communication measures and labelling schemes should be improved to increase consumer acceptance and make a decisive impact on consumers' buying behavior. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

21,This study evaluated the control of streptococcosis outbreaks in Brazil. isolated from diseased sorubim and identified as Lactococcus garvieae by genetic sequencing. This report determined the potential for lactococcosis control in sorubim Pseudoplatystoma sp. with two vaccines: an aqueous-based. whole-cell inactivated vaccine (bacterin) and an oil-adjuvanted bacterin. Their efficacy was evaluated at 30 days post-vaccination (d.p.v.) by challenge with L. garvieae. and the antibody production response at 15. 30 and 60 d.p.v. and the non-specific immune response were compared amongst treatments. High protection levels (P < 0.05) were achieved with the oil-adjuvanted vaccine with a relative percentage survival value of 81.7% at 30 d.p.v. Additionally. the oil-adjuvanted vaccine increased the immunogenicity of the bacterin as indicated by greater agglutination antibody titres from 15 until 60 d.p.v. This is the first report of a positive effect of vaccine administration on the specific immunity of sorubim. and the study showed that a specific antibody plays an important role in sorubim defence against lactococcosis because the innate immune responses were similar in all of the studied animals. These results demonstrated that oil-adjuvanted vaccine can be an effective alternative for the protection of sorubim from L. garvieae disease....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,HIV/AIDS
22,Peyronie's disease (PD) is a localized disorder of the connective tissue of the tunica albuginea (TA) whose etiology has not been elucidated. Although several studies have implicated genetic susceptibility and/or mechanical trauma as triggering events for PD. the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Aquaporin 1 (AQP1) is a water channel protein potentially implicated in connective tissue resistance to mechanical stress. acting primarily by increasing tension within the collagen network. Although it represents a potentially attractive molecular target in PD. to date no studies had ever addressed whether AQP1 is detectable and/or differentially expressed in the TA of these patients. Herein the present study. through immunohistochemical and biochemical approaches. we were able to detect AQP1 expression in the TA of control and PD affected patients. We demonstrated that AQP1-like immunoreactivity and expression are significantly increased in plaques of PD patients Vs controls. implying that AQP1 overexpression might be the consequence of a localized maladaptive response of the connective tissue to repeated mechanical trauma. In summary. these data support the idea that AQP1 might represent a potentially useful biomarker of mechanical injury in the TA and a promising target for the treatment of PD....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Psoriatic Arthritis
23,The dogfish ortholog of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) was amplified from cDNA using degenerate PCR followed by cloning and sequencing. The complete coding region was then obtained using 5' and 3' RACE techniques. Alignment of the sequence with AQP4 amino acid sequences from other species showed that dogfish AQP4 has high levels (up to 65.3%) of homology with higher vertebrate sequences but lower levels of homology to Agnathan (38.2%) or teleost (57.5%) fish sequences. Northern blotting indicated that the dogfish mRNA was approximately 3.2 kb and was highly expressed in the rectal gland (a shark fluid secretory organ). Semi-quantitative PCR further indicates that AQP4 is ubiquitous. being expressed in all tissues measured but at low levels in certain tissues. where the level in liver >gill >intestine. Manipulation of the external environmental salinity of groups of dogfish showed that when fish were acclimated in stages to 120% seawater (SW) or 75% SW. there was no change in AQP4 mRNA expression in either rectal gland. kidney. or esophagus/cardiac stomach. Whereas quantitative PCR experiments using the RNA samples from the same experiment. showed a significant 63.1% lower abundance of gill AQP4 mRNA expression in 120% SW-acclimated dogfish. The function of dogfish AQP4 was also determined by measuring the effect of the AQP4 expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Dogfish AQP4 expressing-oocytes. exhibited significantly increased osmotic water permeability (P-f) compared to controls. and this was invariant with pH. Permeability was not significantly reduced by treatment of oocytes with mercury chloride. as is also the case with AQP4 in other species. Similarly AQP4 expressing-oocytes did not exhibit enhanced urea or glycerol permeability. which is also consistent with the water-selective property of AQP4 in other species....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
24,Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of small membrane proteins that transport water molecules across the plasma membrane along the osmotic gradient. Mammals express 13 subtypes of AQPs. including the recently reported "subcellular AQPs". AQP11 and 12. Each organ expresses specific subsets of AQP subtypes. and in the inner ear. AQPs are essential for the establishment and maintenance of two distinct fluids. endolymph and perilymph. To evaluate the contribution of AQPs during the establishment of inner ear function. we used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to quantify the expression levels of all known AQPs during the entire development and maturation of the inner ear. Using systematic and longitudinal quantification. we found that AQP11 was majorly and constantly expressed in the inner ear. and that the expression levels of several AQPs follow characteristic longitudinal patterns: increasing (Aqp0. 1. and 9). decreasing (Aqp6. 8. and 12). and peak of expression on E18 (Aqp2. 5. and 7). In particular. the expression level of Aqp9 increased by 70-fold during P3-P21. We also performed in situ hybridization of Aqp11. and determined the unique localization of Aqp11 in the outer hair cells. Immunohistochemistry of AQP9 revealed its localization in the supporting cells inside the organ of Corti. and in the root cells. The emergence of AQP9 expression in these cells was during P3-P21. which was coincident with the marked increase of its expression level. Combining these quantification and localization data. we discuss the possible contributions of these AQPs to inner ear function....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Alzheimer's Disease
25,Background: Tick-borne diseases greatly impact human and animal health worldwide. and vaccines are an environmentally friendly alternative to acaricides for their control. Recent results have suggested that aquaporin (AQP) water channels have a key function during tick feeding and development. and constitute good candidate antigens for the control of tick infestations. Methods: Here we describe the effect of vaccination with the Ixodes ricinus AQP1 (IrAQP) and a tick AQP conserved region (CoAQP) on I. ricinus tick larval mortality. feeding and molting. Results: We demonstrated that vaccination with IrAQP and CoAQP had an efficacy of 32% and 80%. respectively on the control of I. ricinus larvae by considering the cumulative effect on reducing tick survival and molting. Conclusions: The effect of the AQP vaccines on larval survival and molting is essential to reduce tick infestations. and extended previous results on the effect of R. microplus AQP1 on the control of cattle tick infestations. These results supports that AQP. and particularly CoAQP. might be a candidate protective antigen for the control of different tick species. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

26,Our previous work supports a role for aquaporin-8 (AQP8) water channels in rat hepatocyte bile formation mainly by facilitating the osmotically driven canalicular secretion of water. In this study. we tested whether a condition with compromised canalicular bile secretion. i.e.. the estrogen-induced intrahepatic cholestasis. displays defective hepatocyte AQP8 functional expression. After 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol administration (5 mg center dot kg body wt(-1)center dot day(-1) for 5 days) to rats. the bile flow was reduced by 58% (P < 0.05). By subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting analysis. we found that 34 kDa AQP8 was significantly decreased by similar to 70% in plasma (canalicular) and intracellular (vesicular) liver membranes. However. 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol-induced cholestasis did not significantly affect the protein level or the subcellular localization of sinusoidal AQP9. Immunohistochemistry for liver AQPs confirmed these observations. Osmotic water permeability (P-f) of canalicular membranes. measured by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. was significantly reduced (73 +/- 1 vs. 57 +/- 2 mu m/s) in cholestasis. consistent with defective canalicular AQP8 functional expression. By Northern blotting. we found that AQP8 mRNA expression was increased by 115% in cholestasis. suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism of protein level reduction. Accordingly. studies in primary cultured rat hepatocytes indicated that the lysosomal protease inhibitor leupeptin prevented the estrogen-induced AQP8 downregulation. In conclusion. hepatocyte AQP8 protein expression is downregulated in estrogen-induced intrahepatic cholestasis. presumably by lysosomal-mediated degradation. Reduced canalicular membrane AQP8 expression is associated with impaired osmotic membrane water permeability. Our data support the novel notion that a defective expression of canalicular AQP8 contributes as a mechanism for bile secretory dysfunction of cholestatic hepatocytes....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Kidney Health
27,Four black fly species of the Simulium striatum species group have been recorded in Thailand. These species are morphologically highly similar in all developmental stages except for the number and arrangement of the pupal gill filaments. In this study. we used multiple characters sources. including morphology. cytology. molecular biology and ecology. to test the hypothesis of conspecificity for S. quinquestriatum (Shiraki). S. nakhonense Takaoka & Suzuki and S. chiangmaiense Takaoka & Suzuki. A molecular study based on the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) was unable to separate these taxa. In contrast. the elongation complex protein 1 (ECP1) sequences clearly differentiate S. quinquestriatum from S. chiangmaiense and S. nakhonense. However. the latter two taxa could not be differentiated based on molecular DNA sequences. Simulium chiangmaiense and S. nakhonense are also similar in the larval habitat characteristics and have undifferentiated polytene chromosome banding patterns. Morphological examination of the number and arrangement of the pupal gill filaments found a number of intermediate forms. Therefore. S. chiangmaiense and S. nakhonense are apparently the same biological species that is polymorphic for the number and arrangement of gill filaments. Thus. we synonymized S. chiangmaiense with S. nakhonense....,biochemistry,MAE,Molecular biology,Hydraulics
28,This study evaluated the ambient noise effect of onshore and offshore aquaculture systems on oxidative status and on some immune parameters in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) juveniles. The experiment was performed for 40 days. projecting two different playlists of acoustic stimuli: offshore aquaculture noise condition that created the typical acoustic field in proximity of an offshore sea cage for fish farming. using a random sequence of quite sea background and boat noises; and onshore aquaculture noise condition that represented the acoustic field inside an open concrete tank for fish farming. A third group without any acoustic projection was used as a control. After 40 days from the beginning of acoustic noise. fish exposed to the offshore aquaculture condition showed significantly higher levels of total oxidant status. lysozyme activity. antiprotease activity and white blood cells together with a lower albumin/globulin ratio in comparison to fish from the control group; whereas fish exposed to the onshore condition showed analytical data placed between the other groups. though never significantly different. These results demonstrate that the offshore aquaculture noise. and in particular the sea soundscape. adversely influences the oxidative status and the immune function of gilthead sea bream determining a mild stress condition that could affect the sea bream welfare....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Immunology,Molecular biology
29,The potential recovery of high-value products from brewery yeast waste confers value to this industrial residue. Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) have demonstrated to be an attractive alternative for the primary recovery of biological products and are therefore suitable for the recovery of invertase from this residue. Sixteen different polyethylene glycol (PEG)-potassium phosphate ATPS were tested to evaluate the effects of PEG molecular weight (MW) and tie-line length (TLL) upon the partition behavior of invertase. Concentrations of crude extract from brewery yeast waste were then varied in the systems that presented the best behaviors to intensify the potential recovery of the enzyme. Results show that the use of a PEG MW 400 g mol(-1) system with a TLL of 45.0% (w/w) resulted in an invertase bottom phase recovery with a purification factor of 29.5 and a recovery yield of up to 66.2% after scaling the system to a total weight of 15.0 g. This represents 15.1 mg of invertase per mL of processed bottom phase. With these results. a single-stage ATPS process for the recovery of invertase is proposed.

30,The function of AZI1 in systemic acquired resistance of Arabidopsis was confirmed by investigation of the phenotypic features of wild-type Col-0. AZI1 T-DNA knockout and AZI1 overexpressing plants after infection with virulent and avirulent Pseudomonas syringae. Real-time quantitative PCR and Northern blotting analyses showed that the transcript abundances of PR genes increased significantly in local and systemic leaves of wild-type Col-0 and AZI1 overexpressing plants challenged with avirulent P. syringae. whereas the mRNA accumulation of PR genes was obviously attenuated in local and systemic leaves of AZI1 T-DNA knockout plants after localized infiltration with avirulent Psm avrRpm1. The changes of metabolomic profiles in distal leaves of three types of materials infected with avirulent P. syringae were determined by H-1 NMR spectrometry and data mining showed that the soluble carbonhydrates might function as signal substances in the systemic immunity of Arabidopsis. At the same time. the expression of the sugar signaling genes in local and distal leaves after infection of avirulent P. syringae was compared. As a result. it was found that the transcript abundances of sugar signaling genes. including SUS1. SUS2. SUS3. SUS6. SUT1. HXK1. HXK2. SNRK1.2. ERD6. TPS1. TOR. SNRK1.1. SNRK1.3 and bZIP11. were obviously changed in distal leaves of different materials with the modulated AZI1 activities. indicating sugar-related genes are involved in regulation of the systemic immunity mediated by AZI1. These results also illustrated that the immune system associated with sugar molecules probably was an important part of the systemic acquired resistance in Arabidopsis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

31,The shape of the inflorescence in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia is a raceme with individual flowers developing acropetally. The ecotype Landsberg harboring the erecta (er) mutation shows a corymb-like inflorescence. namely a compact inflorescence with a flattened arrangement of flower buds at the tip. To gain insight into inflorescence development. we previously isolated corymb-like inflorescence mutants. named corymbosal (crm1). and found that the corymb-like inflorescence in crm1-1 was due to reduced cell elongation of pedicels and stem internodes. Double mutants of crm1 with er and crm2. and crm1-1 crm2-1 er-105 triple mutants show an additive phenotype. crm1-1 is caused by a mutation in BIG. which is required for polar auxin transport. CRM1/BIG is expressed in inflorescence meristems. floral meristems and vascular tissues. We analyzed a collection of 12 reduced lateral root formation (rlr) mutants. which are allelic to crm1-1. and categorized the mutants into three classes. depending on the plant developmental defects. Although all 12 alleles had new stop codons. the phenotype of heterozygous crm1-1/doc1-1 and Northern blotting suggest that new crm1/big mutant alleles are hypomorphic. Auxin-responsive DR5rev::GFP expression was decreased in crm1-1 vasculature of pedicels and stem internodes. PINFORMED1 (PIN1) and CRM1/BIG are expressed in vasculature of pedicels and stem internodes. The severity of corymb-like inflorescence in crm1/big mutants correlated with increased levels of PIN1. Our results suggest that CRM1/BIG controls the elongation of the pedicels and stem internodes through auxin action....,biochemistry,CS,Northern blotting,Bioinformatics
32,Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) has become a routine and robust technique for measuring the expression of genes of interest. validating microarray experiments and monitoring biomarkers. However. concerns have been raised over the accuracy of qRT-PCR in China as well as in the rest of the world. We have previously used qRT-PCR to study the response of ANR1 and other root-expressed MADS-box genes to fluctuations in the supply of nitrate. phosphate and sulphate under hydroponic growth conditions. In this study. we have used both Northern blotting and qRT-PCR analyses to confirm the nutritional regulation of MADS-box genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and test whether both technologies produce the same results. The information obtained indicated that the qRT-PCR results are consistent with those obtained by Northern blotting hybridization for all the tested root-expressed MADS-box genes. in response to different nitrate. phosphate and sulphate growth conditions. Furthermore. our novel results showed that the expressions of AGL12. AGL18. and AGL19 were all down regulated in response to S and P re-supply in both qRT-PCR and Northern blotting analyses....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Polymerase chain reaction
33,Arabidopsis thaliana is a long established model species for plant molecular biology. genetics and genomics. and studies of A. thaliana gene function provide the basis for formulating hypotheses and designing experiments involving other plants. including economically important species. A comprehensive understanding of the A. thaliana genome and a detailed and accurate understanding of the expression of its associated genes is therefore of great importance for both fundamental research and practical applications. Such goal is reliant on the development of new genetic and genomic resources. involving new methods of data acquisition and analysis. We present here the genome-wide analysis of A. thaliana gene expression profiles across different organs and developmental stages using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing. The expression of 25 706 protein-coding genes. as well as their stability and their spatiotemporal specificity. was assessed in 79 organs and developmental stages. A search for alternative splicing events identified 37 873 previously unreported splice junctions. approximately 30% of them occurred in intergenic regions. These potentially represent novel spliced genes that are not included in the TAIR10 database. These data are housed in an open-access web-based database. TraVA (Transcriptome Variation Analysis. http://travadb.org/). which allows visualization and analysis of gene expression profiles and differential gene expression between organs and developmental stages....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,DNA/RNA sequencing
34,The presented research hypothesis-driven laboratory exercise teaches advanced undergraduate students state of the art methods and thinking in an integrated molecular physiology context. Students understand the theoretical background of iron acquisition in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. They design a flowchart summarizing the key steps of the experimental approach. Students are made familiar with current techniques such as qPCR. Following their experimental outline. students grow Arabidopsis seedlings up to the age of six days under sufficient and deficient iron supply. The Arabidopsis plants are of two different genotypes. namely wild type and fit loss of function mutants. fit mutants lack the essential transcription factor FIT. required for iron acquisition and plant growth. Students monitor growth phenotypes and root iron reductase activity in a quantitative and qualitative manner. Then. students determine gene expression regulation of FIT. FRO2. and a reference gene by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Finally. students interpet their results and build a model summarizing the connections between morphological. physiological and molecular iron deficiency responses. Learning outcomes and suggestions for integrating the course concept are explained.

35,Hypersensitive response (HR) is a form of programmed cell death (PCD) and the primary immune response that prevents pathogen invasion in plants. Here. we show that a microRNA miR164 and its target gene NAC4 (At5g07680). encoding a NAC transcription factor. play essential roles in the regulation of HR PCD in Arabidopsis thaliana. Cell death symptoms were noticeably enhanced in NAC4-overexpressing (35S:NAC4) and mir164 mutant plants in response to avirulent bacterial pathogens. NAC4 expression was induced by pathogen infection and negatively regulated by miR164 expression. NAC4-binding DNA sequences were determined by in vitro binding site selection using random oligonucleotide sequences. Microarray. chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses. followed by cell death assays in protoplasts. led to the identification of NAC4 target genes LURP1. WRKY40 and WRKY54. which act as negative regulators of cell death. Our results suggest that NAC4 promotes hypersensitive cell death by suppressing its target genes and this immune process is fine-tuned by the negative action of miR164....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Immunology
36,Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) acts as a signaling molecule modulating the expression of various genes in plants. However. the reference gene(s) used for gene expression analysis of H2O2 signaling is still arbitrary. A reliable result obtained by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) highly depends on accurate transcript normalization using stably expressed reference genes. whereas the inaccurate normalization could easily lead to the false conclusions. In this report. by using geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. 12 candidate reference genes were evaluated and compared in root and shoot tissues of Arabidopsis upon different doses of H2O2. The results revealed that. in our experimental conditions. three novel reference genes (TIP41-like. UKN. and UBC21) were identified and validated as suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization in both root and shoot tissues under oxidative stress. This conclusion was further confirmed by publicly available microarray data of methyl viologen and drought stress. In comparison with a single reference gene (EF-1a). the expression pattern of ZAT12 modulated by H2O2. when using TIP41-like. UKN. and UBC21 as multiple reference gene(s). was similar with the previous reports by using northern blotting. Thus. we proposed that these three reference genes might be good candidates for other researchers to include in their reference gene validation in gene expression studies under H2O2-related oxidative stress....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Polymerase chain reaction
37,Cotton (Gossypium L.) fiber is a unique experimental system for studying plant cell elongation and cell wall biogenesis. Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are extracellular proteoglycans and play important roles in various aspects of plant growth and development. In the present work. four AGP genes. GhAGP2. GhAGP3. GhAGP4. and GhFLA1. were cloned from cotton fiber through 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). All these genes code for classical AGPs containing N-terminal signal sequence. a central domain rich in Ala. Ser. Thr. Pro/Hyp. and C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain. Additionally all the four putative proteins contain two AGP-like domains. one fasciclin-like domain and a putative C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol lipid anchor signal sequence. Northern blotting analysis with gene-specific probes indicates the transcripts of GhAGP2 and GhFLA1 accumulate in Gossypium hirsutum fiber from 5 to 20 days post anthesis. whereas GhAGP3 and GhAGP4 are abundantly expressed during the developmental stage switching from elongation to the secondary cell wall synthesis. Furthermore. quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrates that all these fasciclin-like AGP genes are specifically expressed not only in G. hirsutum fibers but also in Gossypium barbadense fibers. The fasciclin-like domains are typically found in adhesion proteins of animal cell. and the specific expression patterns together with presence of fasciclin-like domains suggest roles for fasciclin-like AGPs in cell-to-cell communication during cotton fiber elongation and secondary cell wall development....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
38,Eicosanoids derive from essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and play crucial roles in immunity. development. and reproduction. However. potential links between dietary PUFA supply and eicosanoid biosynthesis are poorly understood. especially in invertebrates. Using Daphnia magna and its bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa as model system. we studied the expression of genes coding for key enzymes in eicosanoid biosynthesis and of genes related to oogenesis in response to dietary arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid in parasite exposed and non-exposed animals. Gene expression related to cyclooxygenase activity was especially responsive to the dietary PUFA supply and parasite challenge. indicating a role for prostanoid eicosanoids in immunity and reproduction. Vitellogenin gene expression was induced upon parasite exposure in all food treatments. suggesting infection-related interference with the host's reproductive system. Our findings highlight the potential of dietary PUFA to modulate the expression of key enzymes involved in eicosanoid biosynthesis and reproduction and thus underpin the idea that the dietary PUFA supply can influence invertebrate immune functions and host-parasite interactions.

39,World experts of different disciplines. from molecular biology to macroecology. recognize the value of cave ecosystems as ideal ecological and evolutionary laboratories. Among other subterranean taxa. spiders stand out as intriguing model organisms for their ecological role of top predators. their unique adaptations to the hypogean medium and their sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance. As the description of the first eyeless spider (Stalita taenaria). an array of papers on subterranean spider biology. ecology and evolution has been published. but a comprehensive review on these topics is still lacking. We provide a general overview of the spider families recorded in hypogean habitats worldwide. we review the different adaptations of hypogean spiders to subterranean life. and we summarize the information gathered so far about their origin. population structure. ecology and conservation status. Finally. we point out the limits of the knowledge we currently have regarding hypogean spiders. aiming to stimulate future research....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Molecular biology
40,Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) formed between plant roots and fungi is one of the most widespread symbiotic associations in nature. To understand the molecular mechanisms of AM formation. we profiled 30 symbiosis-related genes expressed in Amorpha fruticosa roots colonized by Glomus mosseae and in non-mycorrhizal roots at different stages using differential-display RT-PCR (DDRT-PCR). The expressed genes were confirmed by reverse Northern blotting. Eleven fragments were sequenced and putatively identified by homologous alignment. Of the eleven AM-related genes. five were obtained at the early-stage of plant-fungus interaction and six at the later stage. Three expressed sequence tag (ESTs) sequences were found to originate from the fungi and eight from the host plant by use of PCR evaluation of gDNA of both plant and fungi. The target genes included an ATP-binding cassette sub-family transporter gene. a transposon-insertion display band. and a photosynthesis-related gene. The results provided information on the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of mycorrhizal symbiosis between woody plants and AM fungi....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
41,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) occur in the majority of terrestrial. and some aquatic. habitats worldwide. They are important for the functioning of individual plants and of entire ecosystems. Here. we review trends in research on species-(species recognition. phylogenetic relationships. autecology) and community-level AMF diversity patterns and aim to identify ways of improving the complementarity of these approaches. Research into many aspects of AMF diversity has flourished in parallel with the increasing availability of molecular biology techniques. However. despite their shared goal of understanding AMF biodiversity. species- and community-level perspectives. and the morphological and molecular approaches that underpin them. currently have limited capacity for information exchange. We indicate critical research gaps in AMF species and community characterisation and outline important research directions. We propose steps that could link research using different methods and targeting different aspects of diversity. in order to maximise our understanding of AMF.

42,Archaea are widespread organisms colonizing almost every habitat on Earth. However. the molecular biology of archaea still remains relatively uncharacterized. RNA metabolism is a central cellular process. which has been extensively analyzed in both bacteria and eukarya. In contrast. analysis of RNA metabolism dynamic in archaea has been limited to date. To facilitate analysis of the RNA metabolism dynamic at a system-wide scale in archaea. we have established non-radioactive pulse labeling of RNA. using the nucleotide analog 4-thiouracil (4TU) in two commonly used model archaea: the halophile Euryarchaeota Haloferax volcanii. and the thermo-acidophile Crenarchaeota Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. In this work. we show that 4TU pulse labeling can be efficiently performed in these two organisms in a dose-and time-dependent manner. In addition. our results suggest that uracil prototrophy had no critical impact on the overall 4TU incorporation in RNA molecules. Accordingly. our work suggests that 4TU incorporation can be widely performed in archaea. thereby expanding the molecular toolkit to analyze archaeal gene expression network dynamic in unprecedented detail....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Molecular biology
43,Relative to other historic documents. newspapers have received little attention from researchers as a source of archaeological data. Now that many historic newspapers have been digitized and placed online. this traditionally underutilized resource has the potential to yield new information about archaeological sites. especially those in heavily developed urban areas where sites are inaccessible or have been destroyed. In this article. a methodology is proposed by which archived newspapers might be searched for data about archaeological sites. A case study using newspapers from Allen County. Indiana and its principal city. Fort Wayne. demonstrates the utility of the methodology by producing evidence about many previously unrecorded archaeological sites....,Psychology,Civil,Attention,Remote Sensing
44,Some species of the Arcobacter genus are considered emerging foodborne and waterborne en. However. the presence of Arcobacter spp. in vegetables very little is known. because most studies have focused on foods of animal origin. On the other hand. quinolones are considered as first-line drugs for the treatment of infection by campylobacteria in human patients. but few data are currently available about the resistance levels to these antibiotics among Arcobacter species. Therefore. the aim of this study was to investigate the presence and diversity of arcobacters isolated from fresh vegetables such as lettuces. spinaches. chards and cabbages. Resistance to quinolones of the isolates was also investigated. One hundred fresh vegetables samples purchased from seven local retail markets in Valencia (Spain) during eight months were analysed. The study included 41 lettuces. 21 spinaches. 34 chards and 4 cabbages. Samples were analysed by culture and by molecular methods before and after enrichment. By culture. 17 out of 100 analysed samples were Arcobacter positive and twenty-five isolates were obtained from them. Direct detection by PCR was low. with only 4% Arcobacter spp. positive samples. This percentage increased considerably. up 20%. after 48 h enrichment. By polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). 17 out of the 25 isolates were identified as A. butzleri and 8 as A. cryaerophilus. Only two A. butzleri isolates showed resistance to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The sequencing of a fragment of the QRDR region of the gyrA gene from the quinolones-resistant isolates revealed the presence of a mutation in position 254 of this gene (C-T transition). This study is the first report about the presence of pathogenic species of Arcobacter spp. in chards and cabbages and confirms that fresh vegetables can act as transmission vehicle to humans. Moreover. the presence of A. butzleri quinolone resistant in vegetables could pose a potential public health risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

45,This work aimed to determine the presence of Arcobacter spp. in shellfish and to determine its susceptibility to quinolones. One hundred samples (41 mussels. 37 clams. and 22 cockles) were purchased from different local retail shops in Valencia. Spain. from September 2013 to June 2015. All samples were analyzed simultaneously by culture. after an enrichment step. and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). directly and after enrichment. The susceptibility to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin of the isolates was tested using the disk-diffusion test and E-test strips method. To clarify the mechanism of quinolone resistance. a fragment of the quinolone resistance-determining region of the gyrA gene was sequenced. Thirty-seven samples were positive and 49 isolates were obtained by culture. and Arcobacter spp. DNA was detected in 32% of the samples by PCR. However. after 48-h enrichment. the number of positive samples increased. and 68 of the 100 samples yielded the specific Arcobacter spp. PCR product. In addition. 49 isolates were identified by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The most commonly found species was Arcobacter butzleri (25 isolates. 51.03%) followed by Arcobacter cryaerophilus (19 isolates. 38.77%) and Arcobacter defluvii (5 isolates. 10.20%). Only three isolates of A. butzleri were resistant to both antibiotics. A mutation C to T transition in the position 254 of the gyrA gene was present in the three resistant isolates. This study confirms that pathogenic arcobacters are frequently found in edible shellfish samples. Moreover. this is the first time that A. butzleri and A. cryaerophilus have been isolated from cockles....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Crohn's Disease
46,Arctigenin was previously proven to inhibit Th17 cell differentiation and thereby attenuate colitis in mice by down-regulating the activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). The present study was performed to address its underlying mechanism in view of estrogen receptor (ER). The specific antagonist PHTPP or siRNA of ER beta largely diminished the inhibitory effect of arctigenin on the mTORC1 activation in T cell lines and primary CD4(+) T cells under Th17-polarization condition. suggesting that arctigenin functioned in an ER beta-dependent manner. Moreover. arctigenin was recognized to be an agonist of ER beta. which could bind to ER beta with a moderate affinity. promote dissociation of ER beta/HSP90 complex and nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of ER beta. and increase the transcription activity. Following activation of ER beta. arctigenin inhibited the activity of mTORC1 by disruption of ER beta-raptor-mTOR complex assembly. Deficiency of ER beta markedly abolished arctigenin-mediated inhibition of Th17 cell differentiation. In colitis mice. the activation of ER beta. inhibition of mTORC1 activation and Th17 response by arctigenin were abolished by PHTPP treatment. In conclusion. ER beta might be the target protein of arctigenin responsible for inhibition of mTORC1 activation and resultant prevention of Th17 cell differentiation and colitis development....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Psoriatic Arthritis
47,A method that can be used to more easily perform human body communication. (HBC) has been developed. In the proposed method. Arduino technology is used as a wearable device. Baseband communication is used in this study. Baseband communication uses an operational amplifier to amplify the signal generated by the Arduino. device and uses a comparator to remove noise. This study experimented with a biological tissue equivalent phantom. An application was developed to measure temperature and confirm the transmission and reception of a string. We successfully transmitted a string using HBC with a simple circuit. In addition. changes in impedance and voltage in the electrode were measured.

48,Endothelial cell dysfunction (ECD) is a common feature of chronic renal failure (CRF). Defective nitric oxide ( NO) generation due to decreased endothelial NO synthase ( eNOS) activity is a crucial parameter characterizing ECD. L-arginine is the sole precursor for NO biosynthesis. Among several transporters that mediate L-arginine uptake. cationic amino-acid transporter-1 (CAT-1) acts as the specific arginine transporter for eNOS. Our hypothesis implies that CAT-1 is a major determinant of eNOS activity in CRF. We studied glomerular and aortic arginine uptake. CAT-1. and CAT-2 messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA) expression. and CAT-1 protein in: ( a) rats 6 weeks following 5/6 nephrectomy ( CRF). (b) sham-operated animals. and ( c) rats with CRF treated orally with either atorvastatin or arginine in drinking water (modalities which have been shown to enhance eNOS activity and improve endothelial function). Both glomerular and aortic arginine transport were significantly decreased in CRF. Treatment with either arginine or atorvastatin abolished the decrease in arginine uptake in CRF rats. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blotting. we found a significant increase in glomerular and aortic CAT-1 mRNA expression in CRF. Western blotting revealed that CAT-1 protein was decreased in CRF. but remained intact following arginine and atorvastatin administration. Renal and systemic arginine uptake is attenuated in CRF. through modulation of CAT-1 protein. These findings provide a possible novel mechanism to eNOS inactivation and endothelial dysfunction in uremia....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Kidney Health
49,We examined the extent to which the arginine vasopressin receptor 1a (AVPR1a) and dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) were related to sensitive maternal behavior directly or indirectly via maternal social cognition. Participants were 207 (105 European-American and 102 African-American) mothers and their children (52% females). Sensitive maternal behavior was rated and aggregated across a series of tasks when infants were 6 months. 1 year and 2 years old. At 6 months. mothers were interviewed about their empathy. attributions about infant behavior and beliefs about crying to assess their parenting-related social cognition. Mothers with long alleles for AVPR1a and DRD4 engaged in more mother-oriented social cognition (i.e. negative attributions and beliefs about their infants' crying. beta = 0.13. P < 0.05 and beta = 0.16. P < 0.05. respectively). which in turn predicted less sensitive maternal behavior (beta = -0.23. P < 0.01). Both indirect effects were statistically significant independent of one another and covariates [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.22. -0.03 and beta = -0.03 for AVPR; 95% CI: -0.20. -0.03 and beta = -0.04 for DRD4]. There were no significant direct effects of AVPR1a or DRD4 on maternal sensitivity (beta = 0.02. P = .73 and beta = -0.10. P = .57. respectively). The results did not vary for African-American and European-American mothers (Delta chi(2) = 18.76. Delta df = 16. P = 0.28). Results support the view that one mechanism by which maternal genes are associated with parental behavior is via social cognition....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Prosocial behavior
50,New Findings What is the central question of this study? Can the change in plasma arginine vasopressin concentration (P-[AVP]) in response to osmotic stimulation (P-Osm) serve as a biomarker for NMDA receptor signalling in schizophrenia and depression and thereby distinguish between these mental illnesses? What is the main finding and its importance? In response to hyperosmotic challenge. depressed subjects showed increased P-[AVP] response compared with healthy control and schizophrenic subjects. However. schizophrenic subjects were not different from healthy control subjects in this small sample. The P-[AVP] response to P-Osm' is a suitable biomarker to distinguish depressed versus schizophrenic patients when used with psychiatric screening. This is the first objective physiological measure for schizophrenia or depression. Altered NMDA receptor activity and glutamate signalling might underlie the pathogenesis of both schizophrenia and depression in subgroups of patients. In schizophrenia. pharmacological modelling. post-mortem and imaging data suggest reduced NMDA signalling. In contrast. recent clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of the NMDA antagonist ketamine in severely depressed patients suggest increased NMDA receptor signalling. We conducted a proof-of-concept study to assess whether there is any in vivo evidence for an inverse association in depression and schizophrenia with respect to the NMDA receptor function. For this purpose. we used a translational approach. based on findings from animal studies that NMDA receptor is a key mediator of arginine vasopressin (AVP) release into the bloodstream. Using hypertonic saline to increase plasma osmolality (P-Osm) and thereby induce AVP release. as done in animal studies. we found that in depressed patients the NMDA receptor-mediated AVP release induced by hypertonic saline infusion was significantly increased [0.24 (0.15) pgml(-1)mosmol(-1). P<0.05] compared with schizophrenia patients [0.07 (0.07) pgml(-1)mosmol(-1)]. Slopes for healthy control subjects were 0.11 (0.09) pgml(-1)mosmol(-1) which was less than the depressed group. These findings are consistent with implicated NMDA receptor-related abnormalities in depression and schizophrenia in subgroups of patients and provide the first in vivo evidence of this dichotomy....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Schizophrenia
51,Arginine (Arg) presents a potent growth hormone (GH) releasing activity. in vivo and in vitro studies carried out in our laboratory have demonstrated that acute treatment with Arg also increases GH gene expression. Taking into account the recognizable diabetogenic role of GH and that Arg increases insulin release. this study aimed at evaluating the effects of oral chronic administration of Arg on GH gene expression. by Northern blotting analysis. and on the insulin sensitivity. by means of the Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT). blood glucose decay rate (kitt) and insulin plasma concentration. We demonstrated that rats that consumed Arg (similar to 35 mg/day) in drinking water. during 4 weeks. presented an increase in GH mRNA content (p < 0.01). a decreased peripheral response to insulin. as shown by the reduced blood glucose decay rate (p < 0.05). and a higher insulin plasma concentration (p < 0.01) than control group. Arg treatment did not modify the animals' food and water intake. while it decreased the heart rate and the arterial blood pressure compared to control group (P < 0.05). According to the results presented herein we conclude that chronic oral administration of arginine increases GH gene expression and induces insulin resistance. The arterial blood pressure decrease has already been pointed out in the literature. and seems to occur in response to the dilating effect of nitric oxide generated from Arg. as well as from NO generation in central and peripheral neuronal populations that express NOS and are involved in the autonomic regulation of the cardiac function.

52,Antimicrobial peptides are important components of the host innate immune responses by exerting broad-spectrum microbicidal activity against pathogenic microbes. The first mollusk big defensin (designated AiBD) cDNA was cloned from bay scallop Argopecten irradians by expressed sequence tag (EST) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) techniques. The scallop AiBD consisted of 531 nucleotides with a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA and a poly(A) tail. encoding a polypeptide of 122 amino acids. The high similarity of AiBD deduced amino acid sequence with big defensin from Tachypleus tridentatus and Branchiostoma belcheri tsingtaunese indicated that AiBD should be a member of big defensin family. The expression of AiBD in various tissues was measured by using Northern blotting analysis. mRNA transcripts of AiBD could be detected in haemocytes of unchallenged scallops. The temporal expression of AiBD in haemolymph after Vibrio anguilarum challenge was recorded by quantitative real time PCR. The relative expression level of AiBD in haemolymph was up-regulated evenly in the first 8 h. followed by a drastic increase. and increased 131.1-fold at 32 h post-injection. These results indicated that AiBD could be induced by bacterial challenge. and it should participate in the immune responses of A. irradians. Biological activity assay revealed that recombinant AiBD could inhibit the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. and also showed strong fungicidal activity towards the expression host. Recombinant expression of AiBD made it possible to further characterize its functions involved in immune responses. and also provided a potential therapeutic agent for disease control in aquaculture.

53,Background: Long-acting injectable antipsychotics are treatment options for acute and long-term treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In a previously published 12-week randomized. double-blind. placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with schizophrenia experiencing an acute psychotic episode. aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg (AOM 400) produced significantly greater improvement than placebo on the primary endpoint. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at week 10. Methods: To examine the efficacy of AOM 400 across a broader representation of schizophrenia symptoms. including agitation. a post hoc analysis of this trial was carried out to assess the change in PANSS Marder factor domains (positive symptoms. negative symptoms. disorganized thought. uncontrolled hostility/excitement. and anxiety/depression) and the PANSS excited component (equivalent to Marder factor domain uncontrolled hostility/excitement plus the tension item) by comparing differences in change from baseline between AOM 400 and placebo using a mixed model for repeated measures. Results: The differences between treatment and placebo for all factors were statistically significant. with improvements seen as early as week 1 or 2. and maintained through week 12. Thus. AOM 400. supplemented with oral aripiprazole in the first 2 weeks. showed significantly greater efficacy versus placebo in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia in all 5 Marder illness domains. as well as in agitation as conceptualized by the PANSS excited component score. Conclusions: These findings indicate that AOM 400 is efficacious across the spectrum of schizophrenia symptoms in acutely ill patients. with implications for both short-term and. by extension. long-term patient outcomes....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Schizophrenia
54,This paper develops Bayesian inference of extreme value models with a flexible time-dependent latent structure. The generalized extreme value distribution is utilized to incorporate state variables that follow an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process with Gumbel-distributed innovations. The time-dependent extreme value distribution is combined with heavy-tailed error terms. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed using a state-space representation with a finite mixture of normal distributions to approximate the Gumbel distribution. The methodology is illustrated by simulated data and two different sets of real data. Monthly minima of daily returns of stock price index. and monthly maxima of hourly electricity demand are fit to the proposed model and used for model comparison. Estimation results show the usefulness of the proposed model and methodology. and provide evidence that the latent autoregressive process and heavy-tailed errors play an important role to describe the monthly series of minimum stock returns and maximum electricity demand....,ECE,MAE,Electricity,Machine design
55,Superconducting synchronous generators (SCSGs) are drawing more attention in large direct-drive wind turbine applications. Despite low weight and compactness. the short circuit torque of an SCSG may be too high for wind turbine constructions due to a large magnetic air gap of an SCSG. This paper aims at assessing the effects of armature winding segmentation on reducing the short circuit torque of 10-MW SCSGs. A concept of armature winding segmentation with multiple power electronic converters is presented. Four SCSG designs using different topologies are examined. Results show that armature winding segmentation effectively reduce the short circuit torque in all the four SCSG designs when one segment is shorted at the terminal....,Psychology,ECE,Attention,Electrical generator
56,A detailed discussion on genesis. determinant and algorithmic method of the harmonic distortion of Switched Capacitor integrator and Switched-Capacitor based second order Sigma-Delta modulator is presented. In many instances. people make harmonic distortion analysis of signal through expanding periodic signal into Fourier series or making Fourier transformation for non-periodic signal respectively. Actually. due to the complexity of transient response of Switched-Capacitor integrator. the output expression of second-order Sigma-Delta modulator loop filter is also not trivial. so we will be in great trouble if traditional method is employed when its harmonics are analyzed and calculated in such a way. A fact that is noteworthy is no matter how complicated the output response of the second integrator of the modulator is. its harmonic expression has the same functional form whether in the whole time domain or at the discrete time moments. From this we turn the harmonic analysis of the continuous-time transient response into another thing. namely computing the harmonic coefficients of the transient response at discrete time moments. The least square method is adopted in process of calculation. When developing the output expression of second-order Sigma-Delta modulator. the following point is clarified. that the harmonic distortion is dominated by the first Switched-Capacitor integrator. owing to the suppression resulted from the closed feedback of harmonic distortion of the second stage is much greater than the first stage. In addition. it is avoided that the harmonic distortion is once again brought into the feedback signal in calculation. through the way that first the additive harmonic error model is utilized to get the transfer function. second replaced by gain model in the form of power series. And by doing so. both the feasibility and simplicity of the analysis and mathematical derivation are enhanced effectively....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
57,Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the benefits of Arnica montana on post-operative blood loss and seroma production in women undergoing unilateral total mastectomy by administering Arnica Montana 1000 Korsakovian dilution (1000 K). Materials and Methods: From 2012 to 2014. 53 women were randomly assigned to A. montana or placebo and were followed up for 5 days. The main end point was the reduction in blood and serum volumes collected in drainages. Secondary end points were duration of drainage. a self-evaluation of pain. and the presence of bruising or hematomas. Results: The per-protocol analysis revealed a lower mean volume of blood and serum collected in drainages with A. montana (-94.40 ml; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.48-211.28; P = 0.11). A regression model including treatment. volume collected in the drainage on the day of surgery. and patient weight showed a statistically significant difference in favor of A. montana (-106.28 ml; 95% CI: 9.45-203.11; P = 0.03). Volumes collected on the day of surgery and the following days were significantly lower with A. montana at days 2 (P = 0.033) and 3 (P = 0.0223). Secondary end points have not revealed significant differences. Conclusions: A. montana 1000 K could reduce post-operative blood and seroma collection in women undergoing unilateral total mastectomy. Larger studies are needed with different dilutions of A. montana to further validate these data....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Cancer
58,Among recent high profile scientific debates was the proposal that life could exist with arsenic in place of phosphorous in its nucleic acids and other biomolecules. Soon after its initial publication. scientists across diverse disciplines began to question this extraordinary claim. Using the original article. its claims. its scientific support. and the ensuing counterarguments. a two-day. active learning classroom exercise was developed focusing on the presentation. evaluation. and discussion of scientific argumentation and discourse. In this culminating assignment of a first semester biochemistry course. undergraduate students analyze the scientific support from the original research articles and then present and discuss multiple scientific rebuttals in a lively. civil classroom debate. Through this assignment. students develop a sense of skepticism. especially for the original arsenic-based life claims. and learn to clearly articulate their counterarguments with scientific support and critical reasoning. With its direct integration into first-semester biochemistry curriculum and the excitement surrounding arsenic based life. this assignment provides a robust. simple. and stimulating framework for introducing scientific discourse and active learning into the undergraduate molecular science curriculum.

59,Artemisinin. a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Artemisia annua L. (sweet wormwood). is extensively used in the treatment of malaria. In order to better understand the metabolism of terpenes in A. annua and the influence of terpene synthases on artemisinin yield. the expression pattern of a monoterpene alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH2) has been studied using transgenic plants expressing promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion. ADH2 played a major role in monoterpenoid biosynthesis including carveol. borneol. and artemisia ketone through in vitro biochemical analysis. In this study. the ADH2 promoter was cloned by the genome walking method. A number of putative cis-acting elements were predicted in promoter region. suggesting that the ADH2 is driven by a complex regulation mechanism. ADH2 gene was highly expressed in old leaves. whereas the artemisinin biosynthetic genes were mainly expressed in bud and young leaves. The expression of ADH2 gene increased quickly during leaf development. revealed by qRT-PCR. GUS expression analysis in different tissues of transgenic A. annua demonstrates that ADH2 expression is exclusively located to T-shaped trichome. not glandular secretory trichome.

60,Two newly established canine histiocytic sarcoma (HS) cell lines. designated as PWC-HS01 and FCR-HS02. were obtained from brain and articular tumors. respectively. These 2 HS cell lines had phagocytic ability and modal chromosome aberrations. Although morphologic features of both HS cells were similar. immunocytochemical examinations revealed that the PWC-HS01 cell line expressed both dendritic cell (ie. S100. CD208. CD1. and CD4) and macrophage (ie. CD68. CD163. and CD204) markers. In contrast. the FCR-HS02 cell line was immunonegative for CD204 and CD68 but consistently positive for the dendritic cell markers. Moreover. reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses confirmed histiocytic differentiation of both HS cell lines. These results suggest that HS from the central nervous system may have a tendency to be more undifferentiated compared with cases from other organs. In addition. the 2 newly established HS cell lines were also tumorigenic and metastatic in immunodeficient mice. supporting that these cell lines can be used as new tumor models for investigating canine histiocytic diseases....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
61,shmiRs are pri-miRNA-based RNA interference triggers from which exogenous siRNAs are expressed in cells to silence target genes. These reagents are very promising tools in RNAi in vivo applications due to their good activity profile and lower toxicity than observed for other vector-based reagents such as shRNAs. In this study. using high-resolution northern blotting and small RNA sequencing. we investigated the precision with which RNases Drosha and Dicer process shmiRs. The fidelity of siRNA release from the commonly used pri-miRNA shuttles was found to depend on both the siRNA insert and the pri-miR scaffold. Then. we searched for specific factors that may affect the precision of siRNA release and found that both the structural features of shmiR hairpins and the nucleotide sequence at Drosha and Dicer processing sites contribute to cleavage site selection and cleavage precision. An analysis of multiple shRNA intermediates generated from several reagents revealed the complexity of shmiR processing by Drosha and demonstrated that Dicer selects substrates for further processing. Aside from providing new basic knowledge regarding the specificity of nucleases involved in miRNA biogenesis. our results facilitate the rational design of more efficient genetic reagents for RNAi technology.

62,This paper presents the development of an artificial neural network (ANN)-based improved inductive signal conditioning circuit for pressure transducer with bellow as sensor. A bellow is an elastic-type mechanical pressure sensor. The deflection of the bellow due to applied pressure must be translated into an efficient electrical signal for continuous monitoring. wireless transmission. and digital readout. A ferromagnetic wire attached to the bellow as a part of an inductive coil arrangement. gets deflected due to applied pressure. thereby changing the self inductance of the coil. An op-amp inductive signal conditioning circuit (OISCC) is designed to produce voltage proportional to changes in self-inductance. but the OISCC voltage versus applied pressure exhibits a considerable nonlinearity error due to stray inductances and component drifts. The ANN modeling estimates and compensates the nonlinearity of OISCC. An embedded unit is used for implementation of ANN learning process. The pressure transducer with significant stability has exhibited high linearity and sensitivity of +/- 0.35% and 10 mH/psig. respectively. in the measuring range of 0-70 psig. The design and experimental aspects of the technique are reported....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
63,One of the major challenges of developing and growing of parabolic trough solar thermal power plants (PTSTPPs) is enhancing the techno-economic performance. The goal of this study is to develop a unique artificial neural network (ANN) model that gives the best approach to predict the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of two different PTSTPPs integrated with thermal energy storage and fuel backup system; the first one is using thermic oil as primary heat transfer fluid in the solar field. while the other one is based on molten salt. By this way. the optimum designs of the two plants were determined in the LCOE analysis by using the obtained weights and biases of the best ANN topology. The techno-economic potentials of using Molten salt in comparison to thermic oil of the two optimized plants were investigated considering both hourly and annual performances. The results show that it is possible to get minimum values of LCOE of 8.3 and 7.0 cent$/kWh for oil and salt configurations. respectively. Moreover. because of the difference in dispatch of thermal energy system and solar field aperture area of the plants. the annual power generation and capacity factor of salt plant are much higher than those of oil plant with a difference of around 26%.

64,Background: The androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) is associated with resistance to hormonal therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Due to limitations of the methods available for AR-V7 analysis. the identification of a reliable detection method may facilitate the use of this biomarker in clinical practice. Objective: To confirm AR-V7 as a predictor of resistance to hormonal therapy and develop a new approach to assess AR-V7 by highly sensitive digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) in plasma-derived exosomal RNA. Design. setting. and participants: Plasma samples were collected from 36 CRPC patients before they began second-line hormonal treatment. Exosomes were isolated and RNA extracted for analysis of AR-V7 by ddPCR. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The absolute target gene concentration as copies per milliliter (copies/ml) was determined by ddPCR. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (IBM Corp.. Armonk. NY. USA). Results and limitations: A total of 26 patients received abiraterone and 10 enzalutamide; 39% of patients were found to be AR-V7 positive (AR-V7(+)). Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in AR-V7 negative (AR-V7(-)) versus AR-V7(+) patients (20 vs 3 mo; p < 0.001). Overall survival was significantly shorter in AR-V7(+) participants at baseline compared with AR-V7(-) participants (8 mo vs not reached; p < 0.001). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that plasma-derived exosomal RNA is a reliable source of AR-V7 that can be detected sensitively by ddPCR assay. We also showed that resistance to hormonal therapy may be predicted by AR-V7. making it a clinically relevant biomarker. Patient summary: We report a first study on a method for androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) detection in RNA extracted from cancer cell vesicles released in blood. Results confirmed the role of AR-V7 as a predictive biomarker of resistance to hormonal therapy. Our assay showed that vesicles are a reliable source of AR-V7 RNA and that the method is fast. highly sensitive. and affordable. (C) 2016 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

65,The molecular mechanisms of the endogenous circadian clocks that allow most animals to adapt to environmental cycles have recently been uncovered. The draft genome of the ascidian. Ciona intestinalis. a model animal that is close to vertebrates. has been described. However. the C. intestinalis genome lacks the canonical clock genes such as Per. Bmal and Clock that are shared by vertebrates and insects. Here. we found the circadian rhythms at the physiological and molecular levels. The oxygen consumption rate was lower during the light phase and higher during the dark phase during a day. and the rhythm highly damped and continued under constant darkness. From the microarray analysis. the 396 spots (1.8% of the total; corresponding to 388 clones) were extracted as candidates for circadian expression. We confirmed the circadian expression of several candidate genes by northern blotting. Furthermore. three of four rhythmic expressed genes showed phase-shifts to prolonged light period. However. most of known clock genes did not oscillate. These data suggest that C. intestinalis have a unique molecular circadian clock and the daily environmental change is not such a strong effect for sea squirt in its evolution when compared to vertebrates and insects....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
66,Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) is one of the key enzymes of the plant antioxidant system playing. along with catalase. a central role in hydrogen peroxide scavenging. An approach to further increase the knowledge about cytosolic APX gene organization can be achieved by isolating and characterisating new cDNAs. thus providing new insights about the physiological roles and regulation of these enzymes. A partial cDNA clone (corresponding to the 3' untranslated region). cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase-related. was isolated from potato sprouts by RT-PCR. Database analysis retrieved several expressed sequence tags (ESTs) coding potato cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase. that were used to infer the complete cDNA sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed high homologies with other plant cytosolic ascorbate peroxidases. confirming the reliability of the virtual cDNA. Northern blot analysis revealed the existence of a single band related to the isolated cDNA and the southern blotting results allowed the elaboration of a possible gene organization....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Enzymology
67,Type VII collagen is the major component of anchoring fibrils in the epidermal basement membrane. Its expression has been analyzed by immunostaining or Northern blotting. but rarely at the protein level. In this study. we have quantitatively examined the effects of ascorbic acid and various cytokines/growth factors on the protein synthesis and secretion of type VII collagen by human dermal fibroblasts in culture. using a developed. highly sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay with two kinds of specific monoclonal antibodies against the non-collagenous domain-1. Ascorbic acid and its derivative induced a twofold increase in type VII collagen synthesis. and markedly increased the secretion of type VII collagen into the medium when compared with the control culture. This effect was not influenced by the presence of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). The synthesis of type VII collagen was elevated by TGF-beta 1. platelet-derived growth factor. tumor necrosis factor-alpha. and interleukin-1 beta. but not by TGF-alpha. Thus. our data indicate that the synthesis and secretion of type VII collagen in human dermal fibroblasts are regulated by ascorbate and the enhancement of type VII collagen gene expression by cytokines/growth factors is accompanied with elevated production of type VII collagen at the protein level....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Atopic Dermatitis
68,Safety and reliability are major issues for the ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) pulsed power supply systems. To avoid long downtimes during an experimental campaign. fault-prone components have to be identified and treated early. This becomes even more important due to the AUG participation in the EUROfusion Medium Sized Tokamak (MST) program. Operating equipment which is up to 40 years old adds additional complications. This contribution describes one such example where a 35 year old flywheel generator at AUG was identified as fault-prone and pre-emptively upgraded with a new drive converter with integrated control. Most challenging was to adapt a modern converter. originally designed for wind turbines. toward a drive system for a flywheel-motor-generator system. To identify the layout of the controller and the control parameters. accurate modeling and comprehensive simulations were performed. This effort paid off during commissioning and measuring results verified the calculated design values. Finally. the system shows good performance during AUG plasma experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

69,1. Host-parasitoid systems are characterized by a continuous development of new defence strategies in hosts and counter-defence mechanisms in parasitoids. This co-evolutionary arms race makes host-parasitoid systems excellent for understanding trade-offs in host use caused by evolutionary changes in host immune responses and parasitoid virulence. However. knowledge obtained from natural host-parasitoid systems on such trade-offs is still limited. 2. In this study. the aim was to examine trade-offs in parasitoid virulence in Asecodes parviclava (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) when attacking three closely related beetles: Galerucella pusilla. Galerucella calmariensis and Galerucella tenella (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). A second aim was to examine whether geographic variation in parasitoid infectivity or host immune response could explain differences in parasitism rate between northern and southern sites. 3. More specifically. we wanted to examine whether the capacity to infect host larvae differed depending on the previous host species of the parasitoids and if such differences were connected to differences in the induction of host immune systems. This was achieved by combining controlled parasitism experiments with cytological studies of infected larvae. 4. Our results reveal that parasitism success in A. parviclava differs both depending on previous and current host species. with a higher virulence when attacking larvae of the same species as the previous host. Virulence was in general high for parasitoids from G. pusilla and low for parasitoids from G. calmariensis. At the same time. G. pusilla larvae had the strongest immune response and G. calmariensis the weakest. These observations were linked to changes in the larval hemocyte composition. showing changes in cell types important for the encapsulation process in individuals infected by more or less virulent parasitoids. 5. These findings suggest ongoing evolution in parasitoid virulence and host immune response. making the system a strong candidate for further studies on host race formation and speciation....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Immunology,Immunology

71,Recurrent pneumonia with cavitation leading to pneumatoceles. secondary fungal infections. and hemoptysis are major causes of mortality and morbidity in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome. Prevention and aggressive treatment of pneumonia in these patients are essential to prevent further lung damage. but treatment may be delayed because the classic signs/symptoms of infection such as fever. chills. or rigors may be lacking. Early imaging to identify infection is essential for diagnosis and treatment. The mainstay of therapy is continuous. full-dose daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and commonly fungal coverage.

72,Fungal specific CD154(+) T-cells have been described as a biomarker in invasive aspergillosis. The influence of sample storage on the detection of these cells was assessed. Six-hour delay prior to PBMC isolation is associated with an 18% decrease of cell viability and alterations of the cellular composition of the sample. This results in 87% reduction of CD154(+) A. fumigatus specific cells due to reduced assay sensitivity and increased background values in unstimulated samples. If prompt cell measurement is not feasible. isolated PBMCs can be frozen (at -20 degrees C and -80 degrees C) and processed later with comparable assay reliability (mean value fresh vs. thawing: 0.126. 0.133; Pearson-Coefficient: 0.962)....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Fungal Infection
73,A mycelium-bound lipase from Aspergillus oryzae (AOL) exhibited excellent enantioselectivity for kinetic resolution of (RS)-1-phenylethanol ((RS)-1-PE) in organic solvent. The various reaction parameters affecting the conversion and enantioselectivity were studied. including type of acyl donor. solvent. molar ratio. temperature. enzyme amount. and substrate concentration. The optimum reaction conditions were found to be transesterification with vinyl acetate at 30 degrees C in methyl tert-butyl ether with a vinyl acetate: (RS)-1-PE molar ratio of 1: 1 and an enzyme concentration of 60 g/L. At the optimum reaction conditions. the conversion could reach above 46% with >99% enantiomeric excess of the product. (R)-1-phenylethyl acetate. when the substrate concentration was below 1.4 M. The enzyme displayed an excellent enantioselectivity with an E-value of >200 and a strong tolerance for high substrate concentration of up to 1.8 M.

74,Aims: The study was carried out to isolate and identify the spontaneously growing populations of bacteria and fungi on the surface of biologically recovered polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) copolymer. poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) [P(3HB-co-3HHx)]. Methodology and results: Large-scale PHA biosynthesis was carried out using 300 L fermenter and a biological methodology developed in our laboratory was utilized for PHA recovery. Using standard microbiological and molecular biology techniques the naturally growing microbial populations on the surface of biologically recovered PHA were identified. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that the identified bacterial (Bacillus cereus and Burkholderia cepacia) and fungal isolates (Aspergillus niger. Byssochlamys nivea.

75,Background: Indoor air pollution caused by fungal contamination is suspected to have a public health impact. Monitoring of the composition of the indoor airborne fungal contaminants is therefore important. To avoid problems linked to culture-dependent protocols. molecular methods are increasingly being proposed as an alternative. Among these molecular methods. the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the real-time PCR are the most frequently used tools for indoor fungal detection. However. even if these tools have demonstrated their appropriate performance. some of them are not able to discriminate between species which are genetically close. A solution to this could be the use of a post-qPCR high resolution melting (HRM) analysis. which would allow the discrimination of these species based on the highly accurate determination of the difference in melting temperature of the obtained amplicon. In this study. we provide a proof-of-concept for this approach. using a dye adapted version of our previously developed qPCR SYBR (R) Green method to detect Aspergillus versicolor in indoor air. an important airborne fungus in terms of occurrence and cause of health problems. Despite the good performance observed for that qPCR method. no discrimination could previously be made between A. versicolor. Aspergillus creber and Aspergillus sydowii. Methods: In this study. we developed and evaluated an HRM assay for the discrimination between A. versicolor. Aspergillus creber and Aspergillus sydowii. Results: Using HRM analysis. the discrimination of the 3 Aspergillus species could be made. No false positive. nor false negatives were observed during the performance assessment including 20 strains of Aspergillus. The limit of detection was determined for each species i.e.. 0.5 pg of gDNA for A. creber and A. sydowii. and 0.1 pg of gDNA for A. versicolor. The HRM analysis was also successfully tested on environmental samples. Conclusion: We reported the development of HRM tools for the discrimination of A. versicolor. A. creber and A. sydowii. However. this study could be considered as a study case demonstrating that HRM based on existing qPCR assays. allows a more accurate identification of indoor air contaminants. This contributes to an improved insight in the diversity of indoor airborne fungi and hence. eventually in the causal link with health problems....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Fungal Infection
76,BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to expedite international standardized reporting of bone marrow disease in children with neuroblastoma and to improve equivalence of care. METHODS: A multidisciplinary International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria Bone Marrow Working Group was convened by the US National Cancer Institute in January 2012 with representation from Europe. North America. and Australia. Practical transferable recommendations to standardize the reporting of bone marrow disease were developed. RESULTS: To the authors' knowledge. the current study is the first to comprehensively present consensus criteria for the collection. analysis. and reporting of the percentage area of bone marrow parenchyma occupied by tumor cells in trephinebiopsies. The quantitative analysis of neuroblastoma content in bone marrow aspirates by immunocytology and reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction are revised. The inclusion of paired-like homeobox 2b (PHOX2B) for immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction is recommended. Recommendations for recording bone marrow response are provided. The authors endorse the quantitative assessment of neuroblastoma cell content in bilateral core needle biopsies-trephines and aspirates in all children with neuroblastoma. with the exception of infants. in whom the evaluation of aspirates alone is advised. It is interesting to note that 5% disease is accepted as an internationally achievable level for disease assessment. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative assessment of neuroblastoma cells is recommended to provide data from which evidence-based numerical criteria for the reporting of bone marrow response can be realized. This is particularly important in the minimal disease setting and when neuroblastoma detection in bone marrow is intermittent. where clinical impact has yet to be validated. The wide adoption of these harmonized criteria will enhance the ability to compare outcomes from different trials and facilitate collaborative trial design.

77,Numerous evidences indicate that aspirin usage causes a significant reduction in colorectal cancer. However. the molecular mechanisms about aspirin preventing colon cancer are largely unknown. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a most frequently used method to identify the target molecules regulated by certain compound. However. this method needs stable internal reference genes to analyze the expression change of the targets. In this study. the transcriptional stabilities of several traditional reference genes were evaluated in colon cancer cells treated with aspirin. and also. the suitable internal reference genes were screened by using a microarray and were further identified by using the geNorm and NormFinder softwares. and then were validated in more cell lines and xenografts. We have showed that three traditional internal reference genes. beta-actin. GAPDH and a-tubulin. are not suitable for studying gene transcription in colon cancer cells treated with aspirin. and we have identified and validated TMEM208 and PQLC2 as the ideal internal reference genes for detecting the molecular targets of aspirin in colon cancer in vitro and in vivo. This study reveals stable internal reference genes for studying the target genes of aspirin in colon cancer. which will contribute to identify the molecular mechanism behind aspirin preventing colon cancer....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
78,The consideration of worker heterogeneity in assembly lines has received a fair amount of attention in the literature in the past decade. Most of this exploration uses as motivation the example of assembly lines in sheltered work centers for the disabled. Only recently has the community started looking at the situation faced in assembly lines in the general industrial park. when in the presence of worker heterogeneity. This step raises a number of questions around the best way to incorporate heterogeneous workers in the line. maximizing their integration while maintaining productivity levels. In this paper we propose the use of Miltenburg's regularity criterion and cycle time as metrics for integration of workers and productivity. respectively. We then define. model and develop heuristics for a line balancing problem with these two goals. Results obtained through an extensive set of computational experiments indicate that a good planning can obtain trade-off solutions that perform well in both objectives. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

79,A thorough understanding of the molecular biosciences requires the ability to visualize and manipulate molecules in order to interpret results or to generate hypotheses. While many instructors in biochemistry and molecular biology use visual representations. few indicate that they explicitly teach visual literacy. One reason is the need for a list of core content and competencies to guide a more deliberate instruction in visual literacy. We offer here the second stage in the development of one such resource for biomolecular three-dimensional visual literacy. We present this work with the goal of building a community for online resource development and use. In the first stage. overarching themes were identified and submitted to the biosciences community for comment: atomic geometry; alternate renderings; construction/annotation; het group recognition; molecular dynamics; molecular interactions; monomer recognition; symmetry/asymmetry recognition; structure-function relationships; structural model skepticism; and topology and connectivity. Herein. the overarching themes have been expanded to include a 12th theme (macromolecular assemblies). 27 learning goals. and more than 200 corresponding objectives. many of which cut across multiple overarching themes. The learning goals and objectives offered here provide educators with a framework on which to map the use of molecular visualization in their classrooms. In addition. the framework may also be used by biochemistry and molecular biology educators to identify gaps in coverage and drive the creation of new activities to improve visual literacy. This work represents the first attempt. to our knowledge. to catalog a comprehensive list of explicit learning goals and objectives in visual literacy.

80,Parental sense of competence is one of the central dimensions targeted on psychosocial interventions aimed at supporting at-risk families. Researchers and practitioners need reliable instruments to assess the parental role adapted for these families. Although the parental sense of competence (PSOC) scale has been frequently used to assess this construct. there is still no adapted version for Portuguese parents. In this study. the reliability. validity and factor structure of the PSOC scale is examined with a clinical sample of 146 mothers from at-risk families receiving psychosocial interventions for family preservation from Child Protective Services. Results show that the Portuguese version of the PSOC measures three distinct constructs with acceptable psychometric properties: efficacy. dissatisfaction and controllability. As expected. the obtained factors were significantly and positively related to parenting alliance and family cohesion. and negatively associated with parenting stress. In sum. the proposed Portuguese version shows reliability and validity evidences to measure three relevant dimensions of parental self-evaluation. and it constitutes a cost- and time-effective instrument suited for at-risk mothers....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
81,New Zealand kauri (Agathis australis) (D.Don) Lindl. is a large and long-lived tree species endemic to the species-rich forests of the north of the North Island. Agathis australis are culturally and ecologically significant. but little is known about their ecophysiology. In particular. environmental drivers of fluxes of carbon and water for A. australis trees have not been quantified. We measured leaf gas exchange to explore the effect of leaf age. tree size. foliar nitrogen concentration. photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and vapour pressure deficit (D) on assimilation rates (A) and stomatal conductance (g(s)). We also measured carbon isotope discrimination of leaves and applied an optimal stomatal behaviour model. Both g(s) and A were highest for year one leaves (130mmolm(-2)s(-1) and 5molm(-2)s(-1). respectively) then declined with leaf age to < 80mmolm(-2)s(-1) and < 3molm(-2)s(-1). respectively. in 4-5-year-old leaves. Instantaneous water use efficiency (A/g(s)) was highly variable. but there was no leaf age-related pattern. Our diurnal results indicate that A. australis g(s) peaks early in the day (before 0900 h at 250mmolm(-2)s(-1)) and A is comparatively low. remaining below 9molm(-2)s(-1) throughout the day. Overall. water use efficiency is low based on intrinsic water use efficiency and the stomatal model. Isotopic analysis indicated moderate water use efficiency over the life of leaves compared to other temperate conifers. This information is valuable for modelling carbon and water fluxes of A. australis and for improving our understanding of the threat of summer droughts to these forest giants....,Psychology,MAE,Depression,Hydraulics
82,BackgroundHLA-E products. class Ib human leukocyte antigens. act in the immunology of human reproduction as modulators of the maternal immune system during pregnancy. AimsTo evaluate HLA-E role in the establishment of a viable pregnancy. Materials & MethodsHLA-E was genotyped by sequence-based typing (SBT) and analyzed for specific polymorphisms. comparing couples who underwent assisted reproduction treatment (ART) and fertile control couples. ResultsThere was a significant difference in HLA-E allele and genotype distributions between ART couples and control couples. The allele HLA-E*01:03 was observed in 63.2% of ART men and in 35.1% of fertile men (P = 0.0032). ConclusionThese results suggest that HLA-E allelic variants may play a role in the modulation of immune responses in the context of the inability of natural conception and establishment of a viable pregnancy....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Hereditary Angioedema
83,Referring to two recent publications. we here propose that clinical reproductive immunology has for decades stagnated because reproductive medicine. including assisted reproduction (AR). has failed to accept embryo implantation as an immune system-driven process. dependent on establishment of maternal tolerance toward the implanting fetal semi-allograft (and complete allograft in cases of oocyte donation). Pregnancy represents a biologically unique period of temporary (to the period of gestation restricted) tolerance. otherwise only known in association with parasitic infections. Rather than investigating the immune pathways necessary to induce this rather unique state of tolerance toward the rapidly growing parasitic antigen load of the fetus. the field. instead. concentrated on irrelevant secondary immune phenomena (i.e.. "immunological noise"). It. therefore. does not surprise that interesting recent research. offering new potential insights into maternal tolerance during pregnancy. was mostly published outside of the field of reproductive medicine. This research offers evidence for existence of inducible maternal tolerance pathways with the ability of improving maternal fecundity and. potentially. reducing such late pregnancy complications as premature labor and preeclampsia/eclampsia due to premature abatement of maternal tolerance. Increasing evidence also suggests that tolerance-inducing immune pathways are similar in successful pregnancy. successful organ transplantation and. likely also in the tolerance of "self" (i.e.. prevention of autoimmunity). Identifying and isolating these pathways. therefore. may greatly benefit all three of these clinical areas. and research in reproductive immunology should be accordingly redirected....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Parenting
84,Recent studies on the association between particular single nucleotide polymorphisms of serine-threonine kinase with no lysine (K) 4 gene (WNK4) and essential hypertension have yielded controversial results. Here. frequencies of Ala589Ser polymorphism within exon 8 of the WNK4 gene were assessed among 259 unrelated ethnic Chinese patients with essential hypertension and 235 strictly matched normotensive controls. All subjects were derived from a relatively isolated population identified in the Kerqin desert region in Zhangwu county of Liaoning. northeastern China. which features a dry climate and the people having a high dietary salt intake. in addition to a significantly higher prevalence (similar to 35%) of essential hypertension. Genotypes were verified with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and confirmed by direct sequencing. Expression pattern and regulatory mechanisms of the WNK4 gene were also explored using Northern blotting and in vitro hormone stimulation assays. Strong associations between the Ala589Ser polymorphism and both raised systolic and diastolic blood pressures were identified. In addition to the kidneys. WNK4 gene expression was also found in many other organs. Several cis-acting elements had been discovered in the promoter region of the gene. As revealed by preliminary experiment. various hormones can down-regulate the expression of WNK4. among which glucocorticoid hormone seems to act in a dose-dependent manner. The WNK4 gene probably plays an important role in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. As a missense mutation. the Ala589Ser polymorphism may bring changes to the enzyme's function(s). resulting in increased susceptibility to the disease....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Kidney Health
85,Asthenozoospermia is an important cause of male infertility. The mutations in sperm mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) result in either functionless or malfunctioning some proteins. subsequently affecting sperm motility leading to asthenozoospermia. The purpose of this study was to investigate sperm mtDNA 4.977-bp deletion in infertile men with low sperm motility/immotile spermatozoa compared to healthy subjects with high sperm motility. Semen samples of 256 asthenozoospermic infertiles and 200 controls from northern Iran were collected. After extraction of spermatozoa total DNA. Gap-polymerase chain reaction (Gap-PCR) was performed. The deletion was observed in 85.93% of patients with asthenozoospermia compared with 14% in controls [OR=37.5397. 95% confidence interval=12.937-108.9276. p<.0001]. It is concluded that there is a strong association between sperm mtDNA 4.977-bp deletion and asthenozoospermia-induced infertility in the population examined. Large-scale mtDNA deletions in spermatozoa may induce bioenergetic disorders. Nevertheless. to validate our results broader research may be needed....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Low Testosterone
86,BACKGROUND: Current US guidelines recommend the Asthma Control Test (ACT) for assessing disease control and selecting treatment. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to prospectively assess the ACT and its component questions for their utility in predicting the risk of severe asthma exacerbations. METHODS: Individuals were participants in the Study of Asthma Phenotypes and Pharmacogenomic Interactions by Race-Ethnicity. and those included in the current analysis had the following characteristics: age 18 years or more. physiciandiagnosed asthma. and longitudinal care received at a large health system in southeastern Michigan. Study participants underwent a baseline evaluation. which included answering the ACT. A severe asthma exacerbation was defined as one requiring oral steroids. an emergency department visit. or inpatient admission. Receiver-operator characteristic curves were used to measure and compare the predictive utility of the ACT and its component questions for severe asthma exacerbations. RESULTS: Of 1180 participants. 354 (30.0%) experienced a severe asthma exacerbation within 6 months of their baseline evaluation. When compared with the individual questions that composed the ACT. the composite score was significantly better at predicting severe exacerbations with 1 exception; the composite ACT score and the question assessing rescue medication use were not significantly different (P =.580). Pharmacy-based records of metereddose inhaler short-acting beta-agonist use and asthma severity were also not significantly different from the composite ACT score. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that although the ACT is modestly predictive for exacerbations. the composite score may not be superior to assessing rescue medication use alone for predicting the risk of severe asthma exacerbations.

87,BACKGROUND: Severe uncontrolled asthma (SUA) is associated with increased asthma exacerbations. Whether high blood eosinophil counts are related to this burden is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship of blood eosinophil counts to asthma exacerbations. utilization. and cost in patients with SUA. METHODS: Patients with persistent asthma (age >= 12 years) were identified administratively with SUA in phase I by evidencing (1) 2 or more asthma exacerbations; (2) 6 or more medium-or high-dose dispensed canisters of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) as monotherapy or with long-acting beta(2)-agonist; and (3) 3 or more dispensed non-ICS controllers. Of the 541 patients with SUA invited to participate in the prospective phase II follow-up study. 261 (48.2%) had blood tests (index date) to determine eosinophil count and other atopic biomarkers. The relationship of blood eosinophil cutoff points to asthma exacerbations and direct costs 1 year after the index date were determined by multivariable regression. RESULTS: A blood eosinophil cutoff point of greater than or equal to 400 cells/mm(3) compared with less than 400 cells/mm(3). but not 150 cells/mm(3) or 300 cells/mm(3). was a risk factor in the outcome year in adjusted analyses for 2 or more asthma exacerbations (risk ratio. 1.55; 95% CI. 1.02-2.35; P = .04) and any asthma emergency department visit or hospitalization (risk ratio. 2.29; 95% CI. 1.16-4.55; P = .02). but not for rate of asthma exacerbations or incremental total direct asthma costs per patient ($ 202; 95% CI. -286 to 691). CONCLUSIONS: A high blood eosinophil count was an independent risk factor for 2 or more asthma exacerbations or any asthma emergency department visit or hospitalization. but not direct costs in patients with SUA. possibly constrained by limited power.

88,BACKGROUND: Severe bronchiolitis (ie. bronchiolitis requiring hospital admission) is thought to markedly increase asthma risk. with 30%-50% developing asthma by age 5 years. To date. studies of this association are small. and most are from outside the United States. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between severe bronchiolitis and risk of asthma in a US birth cohort. METHODS: We studied a cohort nested within the Massachusetts General Hospital Obstetric Maternal Study (MOMS). a prospective cohort of pregnant women enrolled during 1998-2006. Children of mothers enrolled in MOMS were included in the analysis if they received care within our health system (n = 3653). Diagnoses and medications were extracted from the children's electronic health records; we also examined pregnancy and perinatal risk factors collected for the underlying pregnancy study. RESULTS: The birth cohort was 52% male. 49% white. and 105 infants (2.9%) had severe bronchiolitis. Overall. 421 children (11.5%) developed asthma by age 5 years. Among the children with severe bronchiolitis. 27.6% developed asthma by age 5 years. In multivariable logistic regression adjusting for 12 risk factors. severe bronchiolitis remained a strong risk factor for developing asthma by age 5 years (odds ratio 2.57; 95% confidence interval 1.61-4.09). Conclusions: In a large Boston birth cohort. the frequency of severe bronchiolitis and childhood asthma was similar to published data. Among children with severe bronchiolitis. the risk of developing asthma was lower than prior studies but still high (27.6%). This difference may be due to different study designs. populations. and outcome definitions studied. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy.

89,BACKGROUND: Mexican-born children living in the United States have a lower prevalence of asthma than other US children. Although children of Mexican descent near the Arizona (AZ)Sonora border are genetically similar. differences in environmental exposures might result in differences in asthma prevalence across this region. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine if the prevalence of asthma and wheeze in these children varies across the AZ-Sonora border. METHODS: The International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Children written and video questionnaires were administered to 1753 adolescents from 5 middle schools: Tucson (school A). Nogales. AZ (schools B. C). and Nogales. Sonora. Mexico (schools D. E). The prevalence of asthma and symptoms was compared. with analyses in the AZ schools limited to selfidentified Mexican American students. RESULTS: Compared with the Sonoran reference school E. the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for asthma was significantly higher in US schools A (OR 4.89. 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.72-8.80). B (OR 3.47. 95% CI 1.88-6.42). and C (OR 4.12. 95% CI 1.789.60). The adjusted OR for wheeze in the past year was significantly higher in schools A (OR 2.19. 95% CI 1.20-4.01) and B (OR 2.67. 95% CI 1.42-5.01) on the written questionnaire and significantly higher in A (OR 2.13. 95% CI 1.22-3.75). B (OR 1.95. 95% CI 1.07-3.53). and Sonoran school D (OR 2.34. 95% CI 1.28-4.30) on the video questionnaire compared with school E. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma and wheeze prevalence differed significantly between schools and was higher in the United States. Environmental factors that may account for these differences could provide insight into mechanisms of protection from asthma. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy.

90,BACKGROUND: Adding a long-acting beta(2)-agonist (LABA) to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) using a fixed-dose combination (FDC) inhaler is the UK guideline recommendation for children aged more than 4 years with uncontrolled asthma. The evidence of benefit of adding an FDC inhaler over a separate LABA inhaler is limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a LABA added as an FDC inhaler. and as a separate inhaler. in children with uncontrolled asthma. METHODS: Two UK primary care databases were used to create a matched cohort study with a 2-year follow-up period. We included children prescribed their first step-up from ICS monotherapy. Two cohorts were formed for children receiving an add-on LABA as an FDC inhaler. or a separate LABA inhaler. Matching variables and confounders were identified by comparing characteristics during a baseline year of follow-up. Outcomes were examined during the subsequent year. The primary outcome was an adjusted odds ratio for overall asthma control (defined as follows: no asthma-related hospital admission or emergency room visit. prescription for oral corticosteroids or antibiotic with evidence of respiratory consultation. and <= 2 puffs of short-acting bagonist daily). RESULTS: The final study consisted of 1330 children in each cohort (mean age 9 years; 59% male). In the separate ICSDLABA cohort. the odds of achieving overall asthma control were lower (adjusted odds ratio. 0.77 [95% confidence interval. 0.66-0.91]; P =.001) compared with the FDC cohort. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates a small but significant benefit in achieving asthma control from an add-on LABA as an FDC. compared with a separate inhaler and this supports current guideline recommendations.

91,Background We have reported that increased fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). a measure of TH2-driven airway inflammation. and blood eosinophil count. a marker of systemic eosinophil inflammation. correlated with asthma attacks in a population-based study. Objective To investigate the relation between simultaneously elevated FeNO and serum eosinophil cationic protein (S-ECP) levels and asthma events among asthmatics. Methods Measurements of FeNO (elevated = 25 ppb) and S-ECP (elevated = 20 ng/mL) were performed in 339 adult asthmatics. Asthma events (attacks and symptoms) were selfreported. Results Simultaneously normal S-ECP and FeNO levels were found in 48% of the subjects. Subjects with simultaneously elevated S-ECP and FeNO (13% of the population) had a higher prevalence of asthma attacks in the preceding 3 months than subjects with normal S-ECP and FeNO (51% vs. 25%. P = 0.001). This was not found for subjects with singly elevated S-ECP (P = 0.14) or FeNO (P = 0.34) levels. Elevated S-ECP and FeNO levels were independently associated with asthma attacks in the preceding 3 months after adjusting for potential confounders (OR (95% CI) 4.2 (2.0-8.8). Conclusions Simultaneously elevated FeNO and S-ECP levels were related to a higher likelihood of asthma attacks in the preceding 3 months. This indicates that there is a value in measuring both FeNO and systemic eosinophilic inflammation in patients with asthma to identify individuals at high risk of exacerbations. Clinical relevance FeNO and S-ECP are markers for inflammation in asthma. but are dependent on different inflammatory pathways and weakly correlated. Simultaneous measurements of both offer better risk characterization of adult asthmatics....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Mental Health
92,BACKGROUND: Obesity and asthma are common health problems in the United States. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical and economic burdens of obesity on hospitalized children with acute asthma exacerbation in 2012. METHODS: Hospital discharge records of patients aged 2 to 18 years with a diagnosis of asthma were obtained from the 2012 Kids' Inpatient Database. wherein the data were compiled by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The discharge records were weighted to estimate the number of hospitalizations because of asthma exacerbations in the United States. To classify whether the patient was obese or not. we used the International Classification of Diseases. Ninth Revision. Clinical Modification code 278.0x. We compared the odds of using noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. mean total charges for inpatient service. and length of hospital stay between obese and nonobese patients. RESULTS: A total of 74.338 patient discharges were extracted. Of these. 3.494 discharges were excluded because of chronic medical conditions. Using discharge weight variables. we estimated a total of 100.157 hospitalizations with asthma exacerbations among children aged between 2 and 18 years in 2012. Obesity was significantly associated with higher odds of using mechanical ventilation (odds ratio 1.59. 95% CI 1.28-1.99). higher mean total hospital charges (adjusted difference: $1588. 95% CI $802-$2529). and longer mean length of hospital stay (0.24 days. 95% CI 0.17-0.32 days) compared with nonobesity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that obesity is a significant risk factor of severe asthma exacerbation that requires mechanical ventilation. and obesity is an economically complicating factor.

93,A large number of asthmatic patients. particularly females. present inadequate disease control. Depressive symptoms are reportedly common in asthma and have been related to poor disease control. but the mechanism of this association is still unclear. Poor quality sleep. frequently observed in asthmatics. is also a manifestation of depression and has been related to uncontrolled asthma. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between depressive symptoms. sleep quality. and asthma control. This was a cross-sectional study of 123 women with previous diagnosis of asthma from a reference center in Fortaleza. Brazil. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); quality of sleep was evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). daytime sleepiness by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). and asthma control by the Asthma Control Test (ACT). Inadequate asthma control (ACT5) in 99 (80.49 %). and excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS >= 10) in 34 (27.64 %). Depressive symptoms were associated with both poor quality sleep (R = 0.326) and inadequate asthma control (R = -0.299). Regression analysis showed that depressive symptoms and sleep quality were independent predictors of the level of asthma control. Asthma control in women is independently associated with depressive symptoms and quality of sleep. suggesting that these patients might benefit from simple measures to promote healthy sleep behavior and sleep hygiene and also that routine screening for depression can be relevant. particularly. in poorly controlled cases....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Healthy Sleep
94,The health and economic burden of asthma in the United States is substantial. Asthma self-management education (AS-ME) and home-based interventions for asthma can improve asthma control and prevent asthma exacerbations. and interest in health care-public health collaboration regarding asthma is increasing. However. outpatient AS-ME and home-based asthma intervention programs are not widely available; economic sustainability is a common concern. Thus. we conducted a narrative review of existing literature regarding economic outcomes of outpatient AS-ME and home-based intervention programs for asthma in the United States. We identified 9 outpatient AS-ME programs and 17 home-based intervention programs with return on investment (ROI) data. Most programs were associated with a positive ROI; a few programs observed positive ROIs only among selected populations (eg. higher health care utilization). Interpretation of existing data is limited by heterogeneous ROI calculations. Nevertheless. the literature suggests promise for sustainable opportunities to expand access to outpatient AS-ME and home-based asthma intervention programs in the United States. More definitive knowledge about how to maximize program benefit and sustainability could be gained through more controlled studies of specific populations and increased uniformity in economic assessments.

95,Asthma is a condition that has consistently demonstrated significant health outcome inequalities for minority populations. One approach used for care of patients with asthma is the incorporation of technology for behavioral modification. symptom monitoring. education. and/or treatment decision making. Whether such technological interventions can improve the care of black and inner-city patients is unknown. We reviewed all randomized controlled trial technological interventions from 2000 to 2015 performed in minority populations. A total of 16 articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria; all but 1 was performed in a childhood or adolescent age group. The interventions used MPEG audio layer-3 players. text messaging. computer/Web-based systems. video games. and interactive voice response. Many used tailored content and/or a specific behavior theory. Although the interventions were based on technology. most required additional special staffing. Subject user satisfaction was positive. and improvements were noted in asthma knowledge. medication adherence. asthma symptoms. and quality of life. Unfortunately. health care utilization (emergency department visits and/or hospitalizations) was typically not improved by the interventions. Although no single intervention modality was vastly superior. the computer-based interventions appeared to have the most positive results. In summary. technology-based interventions have a high level of user satisfaction among minority and urban/low-income individuals with asthma. and can improve asthma outcomes. Further large-scale studies are needed to assess whether such interventions can decrease health disparities in asthma. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy.

96,BACKGROUND: Home-based interventions to improve indoor air quality have demonstrated benefits for asthma morbidity. yet little is known about the effect of environmental interventions in the school setting. OBJECTIVE: We piloted the feasibility and effectiveness of a classroom-based air cleaner intervention to reduce particulate pollutants in classrooms of children with asthma. METHODS: In this pilot randomized controlled trial. we assessed the effect of air cleaners on indoor air particulate pollutant concentrations in 18 classrooms (9 control. 9 intervention) in 3 urban elementary schools. We enrolled 25 children with asthma (13 control. 12 intervention) aged 6 to 10 years. Classroom air pollutant measurements and spirometry were completed once before and twice after randomization. Asthma symptoms were surveyed every 3 months. RESULTS: Baseline classroom levels of fine particulate matter (particulate matter with diameter of <2.5 mu m [PM2.5]) and black carbon (BC) were 6.3 and 0.41 mu g/m(3). respectively. When comparing the intervention to the control group. classroom PM2.5 levels were reduced by 49% and 42% and BC levels were reduced by 58% and 55% in the first and second follow-up periods. respectively (P<.05 for all comparisons). When comparing the children randomized to intervention and control classrooms. there was a modest improvement in peak flow. but no significant changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and asthma symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study. a classroom-based air cleaner intervention led to significant reductions in PM2.5 and BC. Future large-scale studies should comprehensively evaluate the effect of school-based environmental interventions on pediatric asthma morbidity. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy.

97,Compelling evidences point out a crucial role for extracellular nucleotides such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during inflammatory conditions. Once released into the extracellular space. ATP modulates migration. maturation and function of various inflammatory cells via activating of purinergic receptors of the P2Y- and P2X- family. P2RX4 is an ATP-guided ion channel expressed on structural cells such as alveolar epithelial and smooth muscle cells as well as inflammatory cells including macrophages. dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells. P2RX4 has been shown to interact with P2RX7 and promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Although P2RX7 has already been implicated in allergic asthma. the role of P2RX4 in airway inflammation has not been elucidated yet. Therefore. we used a selective pharmacological antagonist and genetic ablation to investigate the role of P2RX4 in an ovalbumin (OVA) driven model of allergen-induced airway inflammation (AAI). Both. P2RX4 antagonist 5-BDBD treatment and P2rx4 deficiency resulted in an alleviated broncho alveolar lavage fluid eosinophilia. peribronchial inflammation. Th2 cytokine production and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Furthermore. P2rx4-deficient bone marrow derived DCs (BMDCs) showed a reduced IL-1 beta production in response to ATP accompanied by a decreased P2rx7 expression and attenuated Th2 priming capacity compared to wild type (WT) BMDCs in vitro. Moreover. mice adoptively transferred with P2rx4-deficient BMDCs exhibit a diminished AAI in vivo. In conclusion our data suggests that P2RX4-signaling contributes to AAI pathogenesis by regulating DC mediated Th2 cell priming via modulating IL-1 beta secretion and selective P2RX4-antagonists might be a new therapeutic option for allergic asthma....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
98,To summarize the principal findings on risk and protective factors for childhood asthma. we retrieved systematic reviews on these topics in children (aged 1 to 18 years). up to January 2016. through MEDLINE. EMBASE. CINAHL. SCOPUS. and CDSR. A total of 227 studies were searched from databases. Among those. 41 systematic reviews (SRs) were included: 9 focused on prenatal factors. 5 on perinatal factors. and 27 on postnatal factors. Of these 41 SRs. 83% had good methodological quality. as determined by the Assess Systematic Reviews tool. After reviewing all evidence. parental asthma. prenatal environmental tobacco smoke. and prematurity (particularly very preterm birth) are well-established risk factors for childhood asthma. Current findings do suggest mild-to-moderate causal effects of certain modifiable behaviors or exposures during pregnancy (maternal weight gain or obesity. maternal use of antibiotics or paracetamol. and maternal stress). the perinatal period (birth by Caesarean delivery). or postnatal life (severe respiratory syncytial virus infection. overweight or obesity. indoor exposure to mold or fungi. and outdoor air pollution) on childhood asthma. but this suggestive evidence must be confirmed in interventional studies or (if interventions are not feasible) well-designed prospective studies.

99,Astragaloside IV. the active component of Astragalus membranaceus. exhibits diverse biological roles including the antitumor activity. In this study. we evaluated the chemosensitive role of astragaloside IV in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 analysis was performed to determine cell viability. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot were used to measure the messenger RNA and protein expression. Results showed that astragaloside IV treatment could suppress the proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer cells. In addition. combined treatment with astragaloside IV remarkably enhanced the chemosensitivity to gefitinib in three non-small cell lung cancer cell lines including NCI-H1299. HCC827. and A549. Furthermore. compared with gefitinib-treated cells. the messenger RNA expression of SIRT6 was obviously increased in non-small cell lung cancer cells treated with gefitinib combined with astragaloside IV. In addition. downregulation of SIRT6 was accomplished using small interference RNA technology. As a result. SIRT6 inhibition abolished the sensitization role of astragaloside IV in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Taken together. these data demonstrated that astragaloside IV sensitized tumor cells to gefitinib via regulation of SIRT6. suggesting that astragaloside IV may serve as potential therapeutic approach for lung cancer....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
0,A retrospective chart review was completed of patients self-identified as lesbian. gay. or bisexual seen through a program for survivors of torture between June 9. 2009 and December 31. 2014 (n = 50). Almost all (98 %) experienced persecution due to their sexual orientation and 84 % were survivors of torture. The circumstances under which the disclosure of sexual orientation took place in the country of origin were often traumatic. In several. efforts were made to change their sexual orientation often through forced marriage. Those in same sex relationships had relationships often marred by tragedy. Women were more likely to be forced to move from place to place. experience rape/sexual assault and threats whereas men were more likely to be persecuted by people on the street.

1,This paper explores the engagement in physical activity as a potential coping strategy for asylum seekers living in the Australian community without the right to work and with prolonged uncertainty. and benefits or barriers to undertaking such activity. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were held with 29 asylum seekers who had arrived to Australia by boat and were living in the community in the cities of Perth. Sydney or Melbourne in July-October 2013 after their release from immigration detention. The ratio of the numbers of men and women interviewed (23 men and 6 women) was comparable to the ratio of men and women who came by boat to Australia seeking asylum in 2012-2013. Nine participants reported that they participated in physical activity as a coping strategy. Seven other participants were so worried about their future and their families that they did not have the mental or physical energy to engage in physical activity. A further six wanted to participate in physical activity but faced a number of barriers to doing so. The seven remaining participants were either not asked about their physical activity engagement because they focused their discussion on other challenges or did not elaborate on why they were not engaging in physical activity. The findings suggest that physical activity. coupled with other coping strategies. are important for some asylum seekers in trying to manage the distress of being denied the right to work and living with prolonged uncertainty. In addition. these findings highlight the critical barrier that government policy plays in disabling engagement in physical activity. which further compounds social exclusion. This includes the lack of welfare support provided. which hinders people's financial ability to access activities and support in the community....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Eating disorders
2,Construction of a random ssDNA sublibrary is an important step of the aptamer screening process. The available construction methods include asymmetric PCR. biotin-streptavidin separation. and lambda exonuclease digestions. in which PCR amplification is a key step. The main drawback of PCR amplification is overamplification increasing nonspecific hybridization among different products and by-products. which may cause the loss of potential high-quality aptamers. inefficient screening. and even screening failure. Cycle number optimization in PCR amplification is the main way to avoid overamplification but does not fundamentally eliminate the nonspecific hybridization. and the decreased cycle number may lead to insufficient product amounts. Here. we developed a new method. "asymmetric emulsion PCR." which could overcome the shortcomings of conventional PCR. In asymmetric emulsion PCR. different templates were separated by emulsion particles. allowing single-molecule PCR. in which each template was separately amplified. and the nonspecific hybridization was avoided. Overamplification or formation of by-products was not observed. The method is so simple that direct amplification of 40 or more cycles can provide a high-quality ssDNA library. Therefore. the asymmetric emulsion PCR would improve the screening efficiency of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. (C) 2015 The Authors.

3,This paper presents a technique for reducing the input current ripple on multiphase power converters that provide multiple heterogeneous power supply rails. such as those present in portable electronics and computers. Through asymmetric interleaving of individual phases. the input current ripple can be reduced compared to conventional interleaving. The technique is derived based on an analytic description of the relevant current waveforms. Practical requirements of a digital control implementation of the proposed technique are analyzed. and its possible performance improvement is quantified through simulations and experimental results. With the proposed technique. close to a 3x reduction in input current ripple. compared to conventional methods. is demonstrated using an experimental prototype comprising a microcontroller that controls a multiphase 180 nm CMOS power management IC....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
4,Optically pure t-butyl 6-cyano-(3R. 5R)-dihydroxyhexanoate ((R)-1b) is the key precursor for atorvastatin calcium. the most widely used cholesterol-lowering drug. In this work. a strain ZJB-09224 capable of asymmetrically reducing t-butyl 6-cyano-(5R)-hydroxy-3-oxohexanoate (1a) to corresponding optically pure (R)-1b was successfully isolated from soil sample. identified belonging to Rhodotorula glutinis based on the morphology. physiological tests. and the 18S rDNA sequence analysis. It was found that heat treatment of cell suspension at 45 degrees C for 25 Min significantly improved R. glutinis ZJB-09224 stereoselectivity. The asymmetric bioreduction of 1a was most efficient at pH 7.5. 35 degrees C. 50 mM (15.0 g L-1) substrate concentration. 40.0 g DCW L-1 cell loading size. 0.54 M (60.0 g L-1) sodium lactate acting as co-substrate. Under these optimal conditions. 0.046 M (R)-1b was produced with de (diastereomeric excess) value of 99.2% after 40 H conversion. Moreover. R. glutinis ZJB-09224 has a broad substrate spectrum. making it a potential tool for some valuable chiral alcohol pharmaceutical intermediates synthesis.

5,The traditional power control schemes for induction heating device mainly focus on the pulse frequency modulation (PFM) and the pulse density modulation. But they cannot solve the problems of power control. efficiency. and load-adaption well. This paper presents and analyzes the asymmetrical frequency modulation (AFM) control scheme used in the full-bridge series resonant inverter. With the proposed AFM control technique. the output power is controlled by two variables: the operation frequency and the division factor. Better efficiency performance can be achieved in the medium and low output power range when compared with PFM. The principles as well as the zero-voltage switching condition of the AFM are explained and the power losses of switches are analyzed. A control algorithm that schedules the three control modes of AFM is experimentally verified with a digital signal processor based induction heating prototype. The load-adaption. noise and thermal distribution problem of switches are also analyzed....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Control engineering
6,Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is often included in the conditioning regimen to prevent graft vs. host disease in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. However. because ATG contains antibodies targeting a wide range of antigens on human cells. its potential off-target effects remain a concern. Here. we explored this question in humanized mice that permit the analysis of human cell depletion in tissues. We showed that ATG binds to almost all lineages of human hematopoietic cells including HSCs. and accordingly it is capable of depleting almost all human hematopoietic cells. Interestingly. the efficacy of ATG was highly variable depending on the tissue of residence. with human cells in bone marrow significantly less susceptible than those in the blood and spleen. Recovery of multilineage human lymphohematopoietic reconstitution in humanized mice that received ATG 3 weeks after HSC transplantation indicates that ATG had a minimal effect on human HSCs that have settled in bone marrow niches. However. efficient human HSC depletion and engraftment failure were seen in mice receiving ATG at the time of transplantation. Our data indicate that the efficacy of ATG is tissue-dependent. and suggest a potential risk of impairing donor hematopoietic engraftment when ATG is used in preparative conditioning regimens.Cellular & Molecular Immunology (2017) published online 26 October 2015...,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Atopic Dermatitis
7,Background: Autophagy is a bulk degradation pathway for long-lived proteins. protein aggregates. and damaged organelles. ULK1 protein kinase and Vps34 lipid kinase are two key autophagy regulators that are critical for autophagosome biogenesis. However. it isn't fully understood how ULK1 regulates Vps34. especially in the context of disease. Polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin (Htt) causes aberrant accumulation of the aggregated protein and disrupts various cellular pathways including autophagy. a lysosomal degradation pathway. underlying the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD). Although autophagic clearance of Htt aggregates is under investigation as therapeutic strategy for HD. the precise mechanism of autophagy impairment remains poorly understood. Moreover. in-vivo assays of autophagy have been particularly challenging due to lack of reliable and robust molecular biomarkers. Method: We generated anti-phosphorylated ATG14 antibody to determine ATG14-mediated autophagy regulation; we employed Huntington's disease (HD) genetic cell models and animal models as well as autophagy reporter animal model to understand autophagy signaling and regulation in vivo. We applied biochemical analysis and molecular biology approaches to dissect the alteration of autophagy kinase activity and regulation. Results: Here. we demonstrate that ULK1 phosphorylates ATG14 at serine 29 in an mTOR-dependent manner. This phosphorylation critically regulates ATG14-Vps34 lipid kinase activity to control autophagy level. We also show that ATG14-associated Vps34 activity and ULK1-mediated phosphorylation of ATG14 and Beclin 1 are compromised in the Q175 mouse model of Huntington's disease. Finally. we show that ATG14 phosphorylation is decreased during general proteotoxic stress caused by proteasomal inhibition. This reduction of the specific phosphorylation of ATG14 and Beclin 1 is mediated. in part. by p62-induced sequestration of ULK1 to an insoluble cellular fraction. We show that increased ULK1 levels and phosphor-mimetic mutant ATG14 facilitate the clearance of polyQ mutant in cells. Conclusion: Our study identifies a new regulatory mechanism for ATG14-Vps34 kinase activity by ULK1. which can be used as valuable molecular markers for in-vivo autophagic activity as well as potential therapeutic target for the clearance of polyglutamine disease protein....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Molecular biology
8,Remodeling of endothelial basement membrane is important in atherogenesis. Since little is known about the actual relationship between type IV collagen and matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) in endothelial cells (ECs) under shear stress by blood flow. we performed quantitative analysis for type IV collagen and MMP-2 in ECs under high shear stress. The mRNA of type IV collagen from ECs exposed to high shear stress (10 and 30 dyn/cm(2)) had a higher expression compared to ECs exposed to a static condition or low shear stress (3 dyn/cm(2)) (P < 0.01). (3)H-proline uptake analysis and fluorography revealed a remarkable increase of type IV collagen under high shear stress (P < 0.01). In contrast. zymography revealed that exposing to high shear stress. however similar positivity was leveled in the intracellular MMP-2 in the control and high shear stress-exposed ECs. reduced the secretion of MMP-2 in ECs. The results of Northern blotting. gelatin zymography and monitoring the intracellular trafficking of GFP-labeled MMP-2 revealed that MMP-2 secretion by ECs was completely suppressed by high shear stress. but the intracellular mRNA expression. protein synthesis. and transport of MMP-2 were not affected. In conclusion. we suggest that high shear stress up-regulates type IV collagen synthesis and down-regulates MMP-2 secretion in ECs. which plays an important role in remodeling of the endothelial basement membrane and may suppress atherogenesis....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Heart Disease
9,Purpose of review ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) has re-emerged as a drug target for LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering. We review ACLY as a therapeutic strategy. its genetics. its molecular and cellular biology. and also its inhibition. Recent findings ACLY is a critical enzyme linking glucose catabolism to lipogenesis by providing acetyl-CoA from mitochondrial citrate for fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Human genetic variants have been associated with enhanced growth and survival of several cancers. and with attenuated plasma triglyceride responses to dietary fish oil. In mice. liver-specific Acly deficiency protects from hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia. whereas adipose tissue-specific Acly deletion has no phenotype. supporting therapeutic inhibition of ACLY. A lipid-regulating compound. bempedoic acid. was discovered to potently inhibit ACLY. and in animal models. it prevents dyslipidemia and attenuates atherosclerosis. Phase 2 clinical trials revealed that bempedoic acid effectively lowers LDL-C as monotherapy. combined with ezetimibe. added to statin therapy and in statin-intolerant hypercholesterolemic patients. Summary The efficacy of bempedoic acid as an LDL-C-lowering agent has validated ACLY inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. Positive results of phase 3 patient studies. together with long-term cardiovascular disease outcome trials. are required to establish ACLY as a major new target in cardiovascular medicine....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Heart Disease
10,Rationale: Forkhead box P3(+) T regulatory cells (Tregs) are key players in maintaining immune homeostasis. Evidence suggests that Tregs respond to environmental cues to permit or suppress inflammation. In atherosclerosis. Th1-driven inflammation affects Treg homeostasis. but the mechanisms governing this phenomenon are unclear. Objective: Here. we address whether atherosclerosis impacts Treg plasticity and functionality in Apoe(-/-) mice. and what effect Treg plasticity might have on the pathology of atherosclerosis. Methods and Results: We demonstrate that atherosclerosis promotes Treg plasticity. resulting in the reduction of CXCR3(+) Tregs and the accumulation of an intermediate Th1-like interferon (IFN)-gamma(+) CCR5(+) Treg subset (Th1/Tregs) within the aorta. Importantly. Th1/Tregs arise in atherosclerosis from bona fide Tregs. rather than from T-effector cells. We show that Th1/Tregs recovered from atherosclerotic mice are dysfunctional in suppression assays. Using an adoptive transfer system and plasticity-prone Mir146a-/-Tregs. we demonstrate that elevated IFN gamma(+)Mir146a(-/-)Th1/Tregs are unable to adequately reduce atherosclerosis. arterial Th1. or macrophage content within Apoe(-/-) mice. in comparison to Mir146a(+/+) Tregs. Finally. via single-cell RNA-sequencing and real-time-polymerase chain reaction. we show that Th1/Tregs possess a unique transcriptional phenotype characterized by coexpression of Treg and Th1 lineage genes and a downregulation of Treg-related genes. including Ikzf2. Ikzf4. Tigit. Lilrb4. and Il10. In addition. an ingenuity pathway analysis further implicates IFN gamma. IFN alpha. interleukin-2. interleukin-7. CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4). T-cell receptor. and Csnk2b-related pathways in regulating Treg plasticity. Conclusions: Atherosclerosis drives Treg plasticity. resulting in the accumulation of dysfunctional IFN gamma(+) Th1/Tregs that may permit further arterial inflammation and atherogenesis....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Rheumatoid Arthritis
11,Objectives: The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between atherosclerosis and periodontopathogenic microorganisms in chronic periodontitis patients following periodontal treatment. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 patients were included in the study. 20 of these patients diagnosed with atherosclerosis and chronic periodontitis formed the test group. The remaining 20 patients were systemically healthy patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis and formed the control group. All patients had nonsurgical periodontal treatment. The periodontopathogenic microorganism levels were determined at baseline and at 6 months in microbial dental plaque samples and WBC. LDL. HDL. PLT. fibrinogen. creatinine and hs-CRP levels were determined by blood samples. Results: Statistically significant reduction has been achieved in clinical periodontal parameters following non-surgical periodontal treatment in test and control groups. Following periodontal treatment. WBC. LDL. PLT. fibrinogen. creatinine and hs-CRP levels significantly decreased and HDL levels significantly increased in both test and control groups. Similarly. the periodontopathogenic microorganism levels significantly decreased following periodontal treatment in the test and control groups. A statistically significant positive correlation has been determined between the periodontopathogenic microorganism levels and WBC. LDL. PLT. fibrinogen. creatinine. and hs-CRP levels in the test group. Conclusions: The association between hs-CRP. WBC. LDL. PLT. fibrinogen. creatinine. and the amount of periodontopathogenic microorganisms indicates the possibility that periodontal treatment could decrease the risk atherosclerosis. More studies must be conducted in order for these results to be supported....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Heart Disease
12,Objective-UVB irradiation is an established treatment for immunoinflammatory cutaneous disorders and has been shown to suppress cutaneous and systemic inflammatory diseases through modulation of the adaptive immune response. However. it remains unknown whether UVB irradiation prevents an immunoinflammatory disease of arteries such as atherosclerosis. Approach and Results-Here. we show that UVB exposure inhibits the development and progression of atherosclerosis in atherosclerosis-prone mice by expanding and enhancing the functional capacity of CD4(+) forkhead box P3(+) regulatory T cells and regulating proatherogenic T-cell responses. Experimental studies in Langerhans cell-depleted mice revealed that epidermal Langerhans cells play a critical role in UVB-dependent induction of CD4(+) forkhead box P3(+) regulatory T cells. suppression of proatherogenic T-cell responses. and prevention of atherosclerotic plaque development. Conclusions-Our findings suggest the skin immune system as a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerosis and provide a novel strategy for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Psoriasis
13,It is accepted that inflammation plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis; the pathogenesis is not clear. B-cell-produced interleukin (IL) 10 is an immune regulatory cytokine that can inhibit immune inflammation. This study tests a hypothesis that a psychological stress hormone. cortisol. suppresses IL-10 expression in peripheral B cells of patients with atherosclerosis. Peripheral blood samples were collected from patients with coronary artery atherosclerosis. B cells were isolated from the blood samples to be analyzed for the expression of IL-10 and micro RNA (miR) 98 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. We observed that the frequency of IL-10(+) B cell was less in patients with atherosclerosis than healthy controls. The serum cortisol levels were higher in the patients than that in healthy controls. Peripheral B-cell frequency was negatively correlated with the serum cortisol levels. Exposure of B cells to cortisol increased the expression of miR-98 in B cells. Cortisol also inhibited the expression of IL-10 in B cells. in which miR-98 played a critical role. Treating B cells from atherosclerosis patients with anti-miR-98 liposomes reversed the ability of expression of IL-10 in the cells. The expression of IL-10 is suppressed in peripheral B cells. which can be up regulated by anti-miR-98 liposomes....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Heart Disease
14,Paroxysmal dyskinesias (PDs) are a group of hyperkinetic movement disorders characterised by circumscribed episodes of disturbed movement. superimposed on a background state in which such abnormality is absent. There is no loss of consciousness. Episodes can last seconds. minutes or hours. and the beginning and end of the movement disturbance are abrupt. Neurological examination is typically normal between episodes. PDs are associated with a broad spectrum of clinical presentations. encompassing various aetiologies. In humans. three main groups of PDs are distinguished. based on precipitating events rather than phenomenology: (1) paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD); (2) paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD); and (3) paroxysmal exertion-induced dyskinesia (PED). In recent years. there has been an expansion of the spectrum of manifestations of PD due to the identification of genes associated with PD in humans (PRRT1. MR-1. SLC2A1 and KCNMAI) and dogs (BCAN and P1GN). The precise pathophysiological mechanism underlying the clinical manifestations of these reported mutations remains to be elucidated. Progress is also being made in the field of immunology. and links to gluten hypersensitivity in Border terriers with so-called canine epileptoid cramping syndrome (CECS) have been reported. This review aims to synthesise a classification scheme for veterinary PDs by reviewing human systems and applying them to veterinary examples. However. it is anticipated that genetic advancement will greatly aid in future stratification and therapy for PDs in dogs. Therefore. classification systems should be viewed as works in progress that should be modified as necessary. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

15,Large-scale atmospheric removal of greenhouse gases (GHGs) including methane. nitrous oxide and ozone depleting halocarbons could reduce global warming more quickly than atmospheric removal of CO2. Photo catalysis of methane oxidizes it to CO2. effectively reducing its global warming potential (GWP) by at least 90%. Nitrous oxide can be reduced to nitrogen and oxygen by photocatalysis; meanwhile halocarbons can be mineralized by red-ox photocatalytic reactions to acid halides and CO2. Photocatalysis avoids the need for capture and sequestration of these atmospheric components. Here review an unusual hybrid device combining photocatalysis with carbon-free electricity with no-intermittency based on the solar updraft chimney. Then we review experimental evidence regarding photocatalytic transformations of non-CO2 GHGs. We propose to combine Ti02-photocatalysis with solar chimney power plants (SCPPs) to cleanse the atmosphere of non-CO2 GHGs. Worldwide installation of 50.000 SCPPs. each of capacity 200 MW. would generate a cumulative 34 PWh of renewable electricity by 2050. taking into account construction time. These SCPPs equipped with photocatalyst would process 1 atmospheric volume each 14 16 years. reducing or stopping the atmospheric growth rate of the non-CO2 GHGs and progressively reducing their atmospheric concentrations. Removal of methane. as compared to other GHGs. has enhanced efficacy in reducing radiative forcing because it liberates more-OH radicals to accelerate the cleaning of the troposphere. The overall reduction in non-CO2 GHG concentration would help to limit global temperature rise. By physically linking greenhouse gas removal to renewable electricity generation. the hybrid concept would avoid the moral hazard associated with most other climate engineering proposals.

16,Exposure to cold physical plasma has been proposed to be of therapeutical value in in oncology via the generation of a number of biologically relevant redox-active molecules. Cancer cells can be recognized and eliminated by cells of the immune system. and accordingly many tumors are populated with these cells. among them T helper cells (TH cells). These lymphocyte population is crucial for effector immune responses against tumor antigens. in response to immunogenic cell death in malignant cells. However. a number of TH populations exists. each having distinct phenotypical features. Using a cold atmospheric pressure argon plasma jet. its redox activity was tested in different TH cell subpopulations to better understand the immunological consequences of potential antitumor plasma treatments in vivo....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Cancer
17,The Arabidopsis vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter gene. AtNHX1. was introduced into soybean by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Four independent kanamycin resistant lines were obtained. The result of PCR. Southern blotting and Northern blotting analyses demonstrated that the AtNHX1 gene was successfully inserted into the soybean genome and stably expressed in these kanamycin resistant lines. The stability of AtNHX1 expression and salt resistance were evaluated in the soybean transformants for over 6 generations. Two independently derived transgenic lines with high expression level of AtNHX1 were selected. and propagated to generation T-5 in the absence of selection pressure. PCR and RT-PCR examinations revealed that AtNHX1 was highly expressed in all investigated transgenic T-5 progenies. Furthermore. all transgenic T-5 plants showed resistant to salt stress. same as those of homozygous T-2 plants. Taken together. our results indicated that constitutive expression of AtNHX1 enhanced salt tolerance in soybean for over 6 generations. suggesting a great potential use of AtNHX1 for improving salt tolerance in plants by genetic engineering....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
18,The advent of atomic force microscopy (AFM) has provided a powerful tool for investigating the behaviors of single native biological molecules under physiological conditions. AFM can not only image the conformational changes of single biological molecules at work with sub-nanometer resolution. but also sense the specific interactions of individual molecular pair with piconewton force sensitivity. In the past decade. the performance of AFM has been greatly improved. which makes it widely used in biology to address diverse biomedical issues. Characterizing the behaviors of single molecules by AFM provides considerable novel insights into the underlying mechanisms guiding life activities. contributing much to cell and molecular biology. In this article. we review the recent developments of AFM studies in single-molecule assay. The related techniques involved in AFM single-molecule assay were firstly presented. and then the progress in several aspects (including molecular imaging. molecular mechanics. molecular recognition. and molecular activities on cell surface) was summarized. The challenges and future directions were also discussed....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Molecular biology
19,Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is an enabling technology which provides coating and material features with significant advantages compared to other existing techniques for depositing precise nanometer-thin two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures. It is a cyclic process which relies on sequential self-terminating reactions between gas phase precursor molecules and a solid surface. ALD is especially advantageous when the film quality or thickness is critical. offering ultra-high aspect ratios. ALD provides digital thickness control to the atomic level by depositing film one atomic layer at a time. as well as pinhole-free films even over a very large and complex areas. Digital control extends to sandwiches. hetero-structures. nano-laminates. metal oxides. graded index layers and doping. and it is perfect for conformal coating and challenging 2D electrodes for various functional devices. The technique's capabilities are presented on the example of ALD-developed ultra-thin 2D tungsten oxide (W0(3)) over the large area of standard 4" Si substrates. The discussed advantages of ALD enable and endorse the employment of this technique for the development of hetero-nanostructure 2D semiconductors with unique properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

20,Atopic dermatitis (AD) or eczema is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease. It is a multifactorial disease with local and systemic immune changes. Current therapies focus on restoring the local skin barrier or inhibiting immune responses. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology. Sehra et al. [Eur. J. Immunol. 2016. 46: 2609-2613] describe a mouse model with T-cell-specific expression of constitutively active Stat6 in Flaky tail mice. which have mutations in the Flg and Tmem79 genes. The authors describe that it is the combination of changes in the skin barrier proteins filaggrin and Tmem79. together with Th2 cytokine signaling in the constitutively active Stat6 transgene. that drives the immune-pathomechanism in AD. These results are consistent with human studies where it is demonstrated that diminished filaggrin expression in skin is a predisposing factor for AD. but is neither required nor sufficient for disease indicating that additional factors are required for disease development. The current mouse model by Sehra et al. could be instrumental in evaluation new therapeutic strategies for AD....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Atopic Dermatitis
21,Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common inflammatory skin disease. but treatment options for moderate-to-severe disease are limited. Ustekinumab is an IL-12/IL-23p40 antagonist that suppresses Th1. Th17 and Th22 activation. commonly used for psoriasis patients. We sought to assess efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. In this phase II. double-blind. placebo-controlled study. 33 patients with moderate-to-severe AD were randomly assigned to either ustekinumab (n=16) or placebo (n=17). with subsequent crossover at 16 weeks. and last dose at 32 weeks. Background therapy with mild topical steroids was allowed to promote retention. Study endpoints included clinical (SCORAD50) and biopsy-based measures of tissue structure and inflammation. using protein and gene expression studies. The ustekinumab group achieved higher SCORAD50 responses at 12. 16 ( the primary endpoint) and 20 weeks compared to placebo. but the difference between groups was not significant. The AD molecular profile/transcriptome showed early robust gene modulation. with sustained further improvements until 32 weeks in the initial ustekinumab group. Distinct and more robust modulation of Th1. Th17 and Th22 but also Th2-related AD genes was seen after 4 weeks of ustekinumab treatment (i.e. MMP12. IL-22. IL-13. IFN-gamma. elafin/PI3. CXCL1 and CCL17; P<. 05). Epidermal responses (K16. terminal differentiation) showed faster (4 weeks) and long-term regulation (32 weeks) from baseline in the ustekinumab group. No severe adverse events were observed. Ustekinumab had clear clinical and molecular effects. but clinical outcomes might have been obscured by a profound "placebo" effect. most likely due to background topical glucocorticosteroids and possibly insufficient dosing for AD....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Atopic Dermatitis
22,Introduction: The goal of replantation after dental avulsion is to maintain the tooth in its socket. Presence of vital periodontal ligament cells on the root surface of the replanted tooth and the immunologic status of the patient are factors that protect against root resorption. It is known that dental constituents play an active role in root resorption by inducing specific and non-specific immune responses; however. little information exists regarding the influence of the acquired immune response on replantation. Therefore. the aim of this study was to evaluate the 5-year outcome of replantation in non-atopic and atopic patients. Methods: Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed in 62 replanted teeth during a 5-year period. The evaluation of atopy was based on the patients' personal and family histories and skin prick test results. The X-2 and the Z tests were used to assess the association between atopy and the outcome of the replanted teeth (P < .05). Results: There were significant differences between the 1-year and 5-year outcomes of the replanted teeth (P < .05) and atopic and non-atopic patients who had their teeth extracted because of inflammatory or replacement root resorption after 5 years (P < .05). Conclusions: Being atopic may offer the advantage of loss of fewer teeth because of replacement resorption. whereas being non-atopic may create an advantage of loss of fewer teeth because of inflammatory root resorption during the first 5 years after trauma....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
23,1. Human ABCA8. a new member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. transports certain lipophilic drugs. such as digoxin. To investigate the roles of this transporter. we cloned a mouse homologue of ABCA8. from a mouse heart cDNA library. named ABCA8a. 2. The deduced mouse ABCA8a protein is 66% identical with that of human ABCA8 and possesses features common to the ABC superfamily. It was found that ABCA8a was mainly expressed in the liver and heart. similar to human ABCA8. 3. We further evaluated the effect of acute digoxin (a substrate for ABCA8) intoxication on the mRNA expression of ABCA8 using northern blotting with a 3' non-coding region as a probe to avoid cross-hybridization with other ABCA genes. 4. Following acute digoxin infusion. the mRNA expression of ABCA8 was significantly reduced in the liver 12-24 h after injection (14.7% of vehicle treatment). but not in the heart and kidney. 5. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the reduction in ABCA8a mRNA. Similar reductions in ABCA5. ABCA7. ABCA8b and ABCA9 mRNA were also observed. A comparable amount of digitoxin did not affect ABCA8a mRNA expression in the liver. 6. The results suggest that ABCA8 may play a role in digoxin metabolism in the liver....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Human Metabolism
24,There is a large body of literature on attachment styles and personality traits. The purpose of this study was to compare two commonly used instruments of attachment that measure secure. fearful. dismissing. and preoccupied styles. Furthermore. we sought to determine which personality factors and facets were common on both of the attachment measures. Overall. 273 undergraduates completed a demographic measure. two attachment scales (RQ and RSQ). and the NEO-PI-R to measure personality. We found high concordance between the NEO-PI-R factors and facets that predicted RSQ and RQ attachment. On both measures of attachment. a secure style was associated with lower neuroticism and higher extraversion. Fearful attachment was consistently predicted by being female. having higher neuroticism (specifically depression) as well as lower extraversion and agreeableness (specifically trust). Individuals scoring higher on preoccupied attachment had higher neuroticism (specifically depression) and lower agreeableness. Finally. individuals scoring higher on dismissing attachment had lower trust. These results confirm Griffin and Bartholemew's(1994) conceptualization of attachment as falling on the dimensions of anxiety and avoidance. Individuals with higher anxiety had higher neuroticism and lower agreeableness and those with higher avoidance had lower levels of trust. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

25,The relationship between adolescents' communication with their significant others (mother. father. and best friend) and quality of life (KIDSCREEN) was investigated in 2262 Scottish adolescent pet owners. The variable attachment to pets was also tested and assessed as a mediator of this relationship. A positive relationship between adolescents' communication with their significant other (mother. father. and best friend) and quality of life decreased when controlling for attachment to dogs. In cat owners. a positive relationship between communication with a best friend and quality of life decreased when controlling for attachment to cats. In cat and dog owners. attachment to these pets predicted higher levels of quality of life. Higher attachment to dogs and cats was explained by good best friend (IV) and attachment to pets (DV) and best friends. Mediation effects of attachment to dogs and cats might be explained in terms of the caring activities associated with these types of pets....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Prosocial behavior
26,The authors examined the association between maternal childhood abuse and the frequency of providing social support to mothers when the victim is an adult and investigated the mediating effects of internal working models (self-esteem. positive relations with others) and maladaptive coping. Using data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States II. they analyzed a sample of 887 adult children using a structural equation modeling approach. The results showed that maternal childhood abuse was associated with providing less frequent emotional support to mothers. although the authors did not find significant mediating effects of internal working models and maladaptive coping in the association between child abuse and intergenerational support giving. The findings suggest implications for theory. practice. and policy to address specific concerns and possible challenges that adults with a history of childhood abuse may experience in the relationship with their mothers....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
27,Much is unknown about adult attachment style formation. We investigate whether negative reinforcement schedules promote hallmark features of secure and anxious attachment styles in a shock threat support-seeking paradigm. Participants ostensibly asked for help from another participant seated in another room. Each time a shock threat signal appeared they were to press a button to indicate their need for help. The supporter could then stop the imminent shock. The reliability of the supporters was varied such that some supporters were consistent (continuous reinforcement) whereas others were inconsistent (variable ratio reinforcement). Results indicated that inconsistently responsive others. reinforcing on a variable ratio schedule. led to heightened approach-related attentional biases toward the supporter. measured by event-related potentials. increased positive attachment associations with the supporter. implicitly measured via a lexical decision task. and more negative explicit evaluations of the supporter....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Prosocial behavior
28,Reder and Duncan's well-known studies of the 1990s on fatal child abuse drew attention to how parental scripts regarding their children could dangerously distort relationships in ways that were sometimes fatal to children. This article reports on a new system for assessing the meaning of the child to the parent'. called the Meaning of the Child Interview (MotC). Parents are interviewed using the established Parent Development Interview. or equivalent. and the transcript of the interview is then analysed according to parental sensitivity and likely risk to the child. The MotC constructs were developed from those used in observed parent-child interaction (specifically. the CARE-Index) and the form of discourse analysis used in the Dynamic Maturational Model - Adult Attachment Interview. allowing a more systemic and inter-subjective understanding of parenting representations than often put forward. This article discusses the theoretical background to the MotC. gives a brief review of similar measures and then introduces the coding system and patterns of caregiving. The validity of the MotC is addressed elsewhere....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
29,Objective: A social-cognitive perspective on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been proposed and posits that impaired social cognition. rooted in attachment insecurity. plays a role in the development of PTSD. Support for the role of impaired social cognition in PTSD has been found in adults. but the social-cognitive perspective on PTSD has not been examined in adolescents. This study sought to explore differences in social cognition and PTSD on the basis of attachment security. and it examined social cognition as a mediator in the relation between attachment security and PTSD and with regard to PTSD symptom change during inpatient treatment. Method: We recruited 142 adolescents from an inpatient psychiatric hospital. where adolescents and their parents completed assessments at admission and discharge. Results: Adolescents with a secure attachment demonstrated better social-cognitive skills than did those with an insecure attachment. Social cognition mediated the relation between adolescents' maternal attachment representations and PTSD at admission across 3 self-and parent-report measures. Social cognition also mediated the relation between adolescents' maternal attachment representations at admission and PTSD treatment outcome. Conclusion: This study provides the 1st support for the application of Sharp. Fonagy. and Allen's (2012) social-cognitive perspective of PTSD to adolescents by showing a link between clinically significant symptoms of PTSD and attachment security through social-cognitive impairment. Findings indicate that improvement in PTSD during medium-stay inpatient treatment is partially driven by baseline attachment security and social-cognitive abilities. highlighting the potential of social-cognitive skills as important targets of clinical intervention among adolescents with PTSD....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
30,There is preliminary evidence that the immune system's cytokines may have impact on ADHD in children. Nevertheless. studies exploring the possible role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in adults with ADHD are lacking. This study aimed to assess differences in serum IL-6 and TNF-alpha between patients and controls and their possible relationship to resting cortisol. 108 adults with ADHD (DSM-IV). 44 inattentive and 64 combined. age ranging between 18 and 55 years. and 27 healthy controls were included. Major psychiatric disorders and organic comorbidities were excluded. Serum samples for IL-6 and TNF-alpha and salivary samples to assess cortisol awakening response were collected on the same day. Analysis of variance was applied to study differences in IL-6 and TNF-alpha between groups. Pearson correlations were used to study associations between IL-6. TNF-alpha. and CAR. There were no significant differences in serum IL-6 or TNF-alpha levels between patients and controls or between combined and inattentive patients. Negative associations between IL-6 (r=-0386. p=0.020). TNF-alpha Cr=-0.372. p=0.023) and cortisol awakening response were found in the inattentive subtype. whereas no association was seen in the combined subtype. A negative correlation between 1L-6 and cortisol was also present in the control group (r=-0.44. 0.030). The peripheral pro-inflammatory markers. IL-6 and TNF-alpha. do not appear to be primarily involved in ADHD in adults. although the role of other inflammatory markers cannot be ruled out. The differences regarding the association between IL-6 and TNF-alpha and morning cortisol response suggest possible underlying neurobiological differences between the inattentive or combined patients that merit further studies.

31,Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of coaction on saccadic and manual responses. Participants performed the experiments either in a solitary condition or in a group of coactors who performed the same tasks at the same time. In Experiment 1. participants completed a pro-and antisaccade task where they were required to make saccades towards (prosaccades) or away (antisaccades) from a peripheral visual stimulus. In Experiment 2. participants performed a visual discrimination task that required both making a saccade towards a peripheral stimulus and making a manual response in reaction to the stimulus's orientation. The results showed that performance of stimulus-driven responses was independent of the social context. while volitionally controlled responses were delayed by the presence of coactors. These findings are in line with studies assessing the effect of attentional load on saccadic control during dual-task paradigms. In particular. antisaccades - but not prosaccades - were influenced by the type of social context. Additionally. the number of coactors present in the group had a moderating effect on both saccadic and manual responses. The results support an attentional view of social influences....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Attention
32,Moving beyond the distinction between biological and social facts has proved challenging due to several basic methodological and ontological differences among scientific disciplines. The aim of this paper is to show how attention schema theory (hereafter AST). developed by Michael Graziano. provides a useful addition to existing integrative approaches that can be used to overcome impediments to interdisciplinary crossfertilization. such that the influence of a range of interconnected institutional. situational. biographical. psychological. neural and genetic variables can be considered simultaneously in a parsimonious way. The paper provides an overview of three basic methodological and ontological differences dividing scientists researching human nature and society. It then draws on AST and a selection of existing approaches in the interdisciplinary vein to demonstrate how to move beyond the reductionist tendencies of each discipline. In the view of AST. intrinsic brain processes and social and situational aspects are intricately intertwined and continuously influence each other in shaping specific attentional focuses. Social identities. biographical experiences. symbols. roles and subject positions contribute to directing attention to certain kinds of stimuli. details. or information. while at the same time. intrinsic predispositions make individuals inclined to attend to different types of information. By accounting for the brain basis of awareness as a subjective experience. AST can be used to clarify how social identities influence attention. and thus. the linkages between individual cognition and wider institutional structures. Finally. the paper considers the relationships between the cognitive and the institutional levels of analysis. and highlights the importance of the latter as a distinct level of analysis. In this way. the paper charts the multidirectional and interactive causal relationship between intrinsic brain processes. attention and conscious awareness. and how they relate to wider institutional structures and joint attentional interactions at higher levels of aggregation....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Attention
33,Despite a wealth of knowledge about the neural mechanisms behind emotional facial expression processing. little is known about how they relate to individual differences in social cognition abilities. We studied individual differences in the event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by dynamic facial expressions. First. we assessed the latent structure of the ERPs. reflecting structural face processing in the N170. and the allocation of processing resources and reflexive attention to emotionally salient stimuli. in the early posterior negativity (EPN) and the late positive complex (LPC). Then we estimated brain-behavior relationships between the ERP factors and behavioral indicators of facial identity and emotion-processing abilities. Structural models revealed that the participants who formed faster structural representations of neutral faces (i.e.. shorter N170 latencies) performed better at face perception (r = -.51) and memory (r = -.42). The N170 amplitude was not related to individual differences in face cognition or emotion processing. The latent EPN factor correlated with emotion perception (r = .47) and memory (r = .32). and also with face perception abilities (r = .41). Interestingly. the latent factor representing the difference in EPN amplitudes between the two neutral control conditions (chewing and blinking movements) also correlated with emotion perception (r = .51). highlighting the importance of tracking facial changes in the perception of emotional facial expressions. The LPC factor for negative expressions correlated with the memory for emotional facial expressions. The links revealed between the latency and strength of activations of brain systems and individual differences in processing socio-emotional information provide new insights into the brain mechanisms involved in social communication....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
34,In heterosexual individuals. attention is automatically captured by physically attractive members of the opposite sex. Although helpful for selecting new mates. attention to attractive relationship alternatives can threaten satisfaction with and commitment to an existing romantic relationship. The current study tested the hypothesis that although a mating prime would increase selective attention to attractive opposite-sex targets (relative to less attractive targets) among single participants. this effect would be reduced among people already committed to a long-term romantic partner. Consistent with hypotheses. whereas single participants responded to a mating prime with greater attentional adhesion to physically attractive opposite-sex targets (relative to less attractive targets). participants in a committed romantic relationship showed no such effect. These findings extend previous research suggesting the presence of relationship maintenance mechanisms that operate at early stages of social cognition....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Attention
35,Fearful faces both capture our attention and hold it. However. little is known about the time-course for the capture and hold of spatial attention by fearful. and other emotional. faces. In three dot-probe studies we examined this time-course. Experiments 1 and 2 used fearful and neutral faces. In Experiment 1. dot-probe targets occurred 133. 266. and 532 ms post-face onset and in Experiment 2. dot-probe targets occurred 84. 168. 336. and 672 ms post-face onset. In Experiment 1. for both 133 and 266 ms conditions. reaction times were fastest for congruent trials and slowest for incongruent trials with reaction times for baseline trials falling between the two. The same pattern was found for the 84 and 168 ms conditions in Experiment 2. For the later time-points in both experiments there were no significant differences between conditions. To examine whether this time-course is unique to fearful faces. a third dot-probe experiment using time-points identical to Experiment 2 was conducted with happy and neutral faces. The results from Experiment 3 suggest that happy faces captured and held attention in the 168 and 336 ms conditions. Together. the results indicate that attention is captured and held by fearful faces at times earlier than approximately 300 ms. while happy faces also captured and held attention. but on a slightly different time-course from 168 to 336 ms....,Psychology,Psychology,Attention,Attention
36,Explicit tests of social cognition have revealed pervasive deficits in schizophrenia. Less is known of automatic social cognition in schizophrenia. We used a spatial orienting task to investigate automatic shifts of attention cued by another person's eye gaze in 29 patients and 28 controls. Central photographic images of a face with eyes shifted left or right. or looking straight ahead. preceded targets that appeared left or right of the cue. To examine automatic effects. cue direction was non-predictive of target location. Cue-target intervals were 100. 300. and 800 ms. In non-social control trials. arrows replaced eye-gaze cues. Both groups showed automatic attentional orienting indexed by faster reaction times (RTs) when arrows were congruent with target location across all cue-target intervals. Similar congruency effects were seen for eye-shift cues at 300 and 800 ms intervals. but patients showed significantly larger congruency effects at 800 ms. which were driven by delayed responses to incongruent target locations. At short 100-ms cue-target intervals. neither group showed faster RTs for congruent than for incongruent eyeshift cues. but patients were significantly slower to detect targets after direct-gaze cues. These findings conflict with previous studies using schematic line drawings of eye-shifts that have found automatic attentional orienting to be reduced in schizophrenia. Instead. our data indicate that patients display abnormalities in responding to gaze direction at various stages of gaze processing-reflected by a stronger preferential capture of attention by another person's direct eye contact at initial stages of gaze processing and difficulties disengaging from a gazed-at location once shared attention is established....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
37,Attentional lapses are usually defined as temporary and often brief shifts of attention away from some primary task to unrelated internal information processing. This study addressed the incidence of attention lapses and differences in attentional functioning in 30 children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 26 healthy children. and 29 children with spina bifida myelomeningocele and hydrocephalus (SBH). Assessments were conducted using computerized tonic and phasic attention tests. the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). and the Trail Making Test Form B (TMT-B). The group with SBH differed from normal controls on cognitive measures of attention and executive functions. The ADHD group obtained lower scores than the SBH group and healthy children. ANOVA results showed that there was an effect of shunt revisions and shunt-related infections on neuropsychological performance. Lapses of attention together with reaction time may thus represent important factors for the understanding of cognitive deficits in SBH....,Psychology,Medical,Attention,Children's Health
38,Introduction: Previous studies have demonstrated that students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) struggle particularly with grasping the implicit. inferential level of narratives that is crucial for story comprehension. However. these studies used offline tasks (i.e.. after story presentation). used indirect measurements (e.g.. identifying main ideas). and/or yielded inconclusive results using think-aloud techniques. Moreover. most studies were conducted with preschool or elementary school children with ADHD. using listening or televised story comprehension. In this study. we were interested in examining the spontaneous. immediate activation and/or suppression of forward-predictive inferences. backward-explanatory inferences. and inference-evoking textual information. as they occur online during reading comprehension by adolescents with ADHD. Method: Participants with and without ADHD read short narrative texts. each of which included a predictive sentence. a bridging sentence that referred back to the predictive sentence via actualization of the predicted event. and two intervening sentences positioned between the predictive and bridging sentences that introduced a temporary transition from the main (predictive) episode. Activation and suppression of inferential and/or textual information were assessed using naming times of word probes that were implied by the preceding text. explicitly mentioned in it. or neither when following control texts. In some cases. a true-false inferential or textual question followed the probe. Results: Naming facilitations were observed for the control but not for the ADHD group. in responding to inference probes that followed the predictive and bridging sentences. and to text probes that followed the predictive sentences. Participants with ADHD were accurate. albeit slower. than controls in answering the true-false questions. Conclusions: Adolescents with ADHD have difficulties in generating predictive and explanatory inferences and in retaining relevant textual information in working memory while reading. although they can answer questions after reading when texts are relatively short. These findings are discussed with regard to development of comprehension strategies for individuals with ADHD....,Psychology,Psychology,Attention,Attention
39,Introduction: Cannabis users are at higher risk for any mental disorder than the general population. However. there remains a shortage of research that examines the relationship between reluctance to seek mental health treatment and subsequent frequent cannabis use. This study evaluates whether negative attitudes toward mental health treatment (i.e. attitudinal barriers) predict a high frequency of cannabis use and whether using cannabis to cope with mental health symptoms (i.e.. coping motives) explains this relationship. Methods: Participants were students at Washington State University (WSU) who received violations for illegal cannabis use or possession. Data were collected from participants 60 days after a mandated two-part course for cannabis harm reduction (n = 98). A cross-sectional path analysis was performed to assess whether coping motives mediated the relationship between attitudinal barriers to mental health treatment and frequency of cannabis use after controlling for mental health symptoms. Results: Coping motives fully mediated the relationship between negative attitudes toward treatment and frequency of use (indirect effect: (beta = 0.087. bootstrap CI: 0.016-0.541). The direction of results was confirmed by switching the mediator and criterion variable. The model fit well with the data (x(2) (2) = 0.367. p = 0.83. RMSEA = 0.00. CFI = 1. SRMR = 0.008). Conclusions: Reluctance to seek mental health treatment may be related to higher levels of cannabis use through coping motives. Addressing attitudes toward mental health treatment may be an alternative way to decrease frequency of use or possibly promote mental health treatment-seeking behaviors when needed. Further studies are needed to confirm the implications of this finding. Published by Elsevier Ltd....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Schizophrenia
40,This study aims to investigate the impacts of a digital learning module with guided peer feedback on students' domain-specific knowledge gain and their attitudinal change in the field of biotechnology and molecular life sciences. The extent to which the use of this module is appreciated by students is studied as well. A pre-test. post-test design was used with 203 students who were randomly assigned to groups of three. They were asked to work on the digital module with the aim of exploring various perspectives. and the pros and cons on the topic of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). The results suggest that the module can be used to foster students' domain-specific knowledge gain and their attitudinal change. Furthermore. the module was evaluated positively in terms of students' motivation and satisfaction with the learning experiences.

41,High-valent Au(III) complexes have attracted much attention as catalysts in many reactions. Nevertheless Au(III) catalysts suffer from instability of the oxidized metal complexes during preparation and use. Herein. we demonstrated that Au(III) catalysts can be stabilized against reduction to metallic Au by modifying supported-ionic-liquid-phase-stabilized Au(III) catalyst with CuCl2. It was found that the that reduced Au could be re -oxidized in situ to Au3+ species by CuCl2 during the reaction and further stabilized by the electron transfer from Cu to these active species. When evaluated in the acetylene hydrochlorination reaction. the Au-Cu-IL/AC catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity with the turnover frequency (TOF) as high as 168.5 h(-1) and more than 99.8% selectivity fot the product. vinyl chloride (VCM). Furthermore. the Au-Cu-IL/AC catalyst demonstrated a stable catalytic performance with a negligible loss of C2H2 conversion after 500 h under typical industrial reaction conditions for acetylene hydrochlorination. Therefore. the findings of this work provide an efficient approach for designing stable high-valent metals for long-term operation. and also pave the way for the application of Au-Cu-IL/AC catalyst in industrial VCM production.

42,A low-quiescent high-performance class-AB headphone amplifier is presented. The effect of the input-referred offset on the quiescent power of audio power amplifier (APA) that drives very small resistive load is described and analyzed. A digitally assisted offset calibration-based APA topology together with improved frequency compensation is proposed. This permits the use of low quiescent power and small compensation capacitance. Implemented in 65-nm CMOS technology. the amplifier occupies an area of 0.15 mm(2) and consumes 0.4 mW at +/- 1 V supplies. At the load of 16 Omega//200 pF. the gain-bandwidth product is 1.78 MHz using a total compensation capacitance of 8.5 pF. Other performance metrics are measured with -89-dB total harmonic distortion (THD+ N). 93.5-dB signal-to-noise ratio. 84-dB power supply rejection ratio (PSRR+). and 105-dB PSRR-@ 217 Hz. It can deliver a peak power of 35 mW (1.5 Vpp swing) to the above load. yielding the best figure-of-merit (FOM) = (peak load power/quiescent power) and the best FOM2 = [peak load power/quiescent power * (THD+ N)%] with respect to other reported representative works....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Operational amplifier
43,It is traditionally challenging to implement higher-order PWM closed-loop Class-D audio amplifiers using analog intensive techniques in deep-submicron. low voltage process technologies. This is primarily attributed to reduced power supply. degraded analog transistor characteristics. including short-channel effects. increased flicker noise. random telegraph noise. transistor reliability concerns and passive component performance. In this paper. we introduce a global closed-loop mixed-signal architecture incorporating digital control and integrate a fourth-order amplifier prototype in 55 nm CMOS. A systematic approach to analyze. design and compensate the feedback loop in the digital domain is also presented. The versatility of implementing the loop gain poles and zeros digitally attains high gain throughout the audio band and attenuates residual high frequency ripples around the loop. simultaneously accomplishing improvements in THD+ N and PSRR. The overall architecture is inherently amenable to implementation in deep-submicron and is therefore compatible with scaled CMOS. The measured prototype achieves a high 105 dBA SNR. 0.0031% THD+ N. 92 dB PSRR and 85% efficiency when supplying 1 W into emulated 8 speaker load. This performance is competitive with conventional designs using large feature size precision CMOS or specialized BCD technologies and reports the highest output power (1.5 W) for deep-submicron designs....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
44,In this study a novel auditory version of the Single Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT-A) was developed to investigate (a) the valence of adults' associations to infant cries and laughs. (b) moderation of implicit associations by gender and empathy. and (c) the robustness of implicit associations controlling for auditory sensitivity. Eighty adults (50% females) were administered two SC-IAT-As. the Empathy Quotient. and the Weinstein Noise Sensitivity Scale. Adults showed positive implicit associations to infant laugh and negative ones to infant cry; only the implicit associations with the infant laugh were negatively related to empathy scores. and no gender differences were observed. Finally. implicit associations to infant cry were affected by noise sensitivity. The SC-IAT-A is useful to evaluate the valence of implicit reactions to infant auditory cues and could provide fresh insights into understanding processes that regulate the quality of adult-infant relationships....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Person perception
45,Introduction. Plum cultivars exhibit differences in their fruit quality; however. very little is known about the changes in fruit growth and quality of plum cultivars maturing in different seasons. This study was conducted to contribute to a better understanding of the fruit growth and ripening behavior of Japanese plum (Prunus silicina Lindl.) varieties according to their maturing season. Materials and methods. Three Japanese plum cultivars were studied: early- ['Black Amber' (BA)]. mid-['Amber Jewel' (AJ)] and late-season ['Angelino' (AG)] maturing. The increase in fruit weight and diameter was determined from days after full bloom (DAFB) to harvest. whilst changes in fruit pulp. skin and seed dry weights. fruit firmness. soluble solid contents (SSC). and titratable acidity (TA) were studied during days after stone hardening (DASH). Ethylene production. respiration rate. activities of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase (ACO) enzymes. fruit firmness. fruit color. SSC. TA. ascorbic acid. total antioxidant and carotenoid contents were determined at alternate days during fruit ripening. Results and discussion. All plum cultivars exhibited three distinct phases of fruit growth and development in the DAFB. The AG fruit exhibited the longest duration of phase-III. about 64 days and 12 days more. as compared with BA and AJ fruits. respectively. Fruit skin dry weight (%) was higher for AG fruit. whilst. AJ and BA fruits exhibited the highest increase in seed and pulp dry weight (%) during DASH. The BA and AJ fruits showed climacteric fruit ripening with a sharp rise in ACS and ACO enzymes; whereas AG fruit showed suppressed climacteric ripening. During the fruit ripening period AG fruit remained more firm with higher SSC. and SCC: TA ratio as compared with BA and AJ fruits. The level of ascorbic acid (24.8 mg 100 g(-1)) was higher in AG fruit. Whilst. total carotenoids (0.66 mg 100 g(-1)) and total antioxidants (215 mu mol Trolox 100 g(-1)) were higher in AJ and BA fruit respectively. Conclusion. The physico-chemical changes during fruit ripening vary with cultivar and are associated with the level of endogenous ethylene production. Japanese plum cultivars exhibit varying levels of SSC. SSC: TA ratio. levels of individual and total antioxidants of their ripe fruits....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Molecular biology
46,Although recent scholarship focuses on the increasing significance of processes of standardization in contemporary social life. much less attention has been given to how standardization impacts intimate life. and how intimate standards are made meaningful in interaction. This article draws from participant observation in online transgender groups to examine how the medical standardization of transsexuality. known as the wrong-body' model. impacts the way users understand and communicate their gendered self. I show how rather than simply adopting the wrong-body model. participants use its language and logic in ironic and playful ways that carve out spaces for ways of knowing the self that feel authentically their own. This case shows how intimate standards become part of the language of the self in ways that may be unexpected....,Psychology,Psychology,Attention,Gender roles
47,Across a broad range of design professions. there has been extensive research on design practices and considerable progress in creating new computer-based systems that support design work. Our research is focused on educational/instructional design for students' learning. In this sub-field. progress has been more limited. In particular. neither research nor systems development have paid much attention to the fact that design is becoming a more collaborative endeavor. This paper reports the latest research outcomes from R&D in the Educational Design Studio (EDS). a facility developed iteratively over four years to support and understand collaborative. real-time. co-present design work. The EDS serves to (i) enhance our scientific understanding of design processes and design cognition and (ii) provide insights into how designers' work can be improved through appropriate technological support. In the study presented here. we introduced a complex. multi-user. digital design tool into the existing ecology of tools and resources available in the EDS. We analysed the activity of four pairs of 'teacher-designers' during a design task. We identified different behaviors - in reconfiguring the task. the working methods and toolset usage. Our data provide new insights about the affordances of different digital and analogue design surfaces used in the Studio. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

48,The aim of this study was to identify specific cognitive abilities that predict functional outcome in high-functioning adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). and to clarify the contribution of those abilities and their relationships. In total. 41 adults with ASD performed cognitive tasks in a broad range of neuro- and social cognitive domains. and information concerning functional outcomes was obtained. Regression analyses revealed that emotion perception and verbal generativity predicted adaptive functioning directly. and the former mediated between the other two. These findings provide the first evidence of a triadic relationship among neuro- and social cognition and functional outcome in this population. Our results suggest that psychosocial interventions targeting these cognitive abilities could benefit social adaptation in adults with ASD....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
49,Background Cognitive differences. including deficits in self-awareness. are common in high-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and represent a fruitful target for intervention. The current project presents the preliminary research undertaken in the development of metacognitive training (MCT). an intervention designed to increase knowledge about personal strengths and challenges in adolescents with ASD.Method Two groups of 4 adolescents with ASD completed MCT. as well as measures to assess satisfaction and adverse effects. Visual inspection and thematic analysis were used to interpret the data.Results Overall. both participants and their parents rated MCT favourably; the youth most enjoyed the interactive activities. whereas parents appreciated the opportunity for socialising and psychoeducation. There were no systematic changes on quantitative measures of adverse effects (i.e. self-esteem or depression).Conclusion Although the results suggest further investigation of MCT may be warranted. certain modifications to the MCT protocol and research methodology are needed....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Social cognition
50,The present study aimed to examine the effects of a novel avatar interviewing aid during memory interviews with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Thirty children were recruited for our study (Age: M = 7.60. SD = 0.68). half with ASD (13 boys; 2 girls) and the other half being neurotypical (13 boys; 2 girls). Children participated in a target event and were subsequently interviewed a week later by either an avatar interviewer or a human. The participants were also asked six misleading questions aimed to examine their suggestibility. Bayesian analysis showed some increase in memory performance for both groups of children interviewed by the avatar interviewer. and this effect exacerbated for children with ASD. These results showed encouraging implications for future applications....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,False memories
51,The ability of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to process context has long been debated: According to the Weak Central Coherence theory. ASD is characterized by poor global processing. and consequentlypoor context processing. In contrast. the Social Cognition theory argues individuals with ASD will present difficulties only in social context processing. The complexity theory of autism suggests context processing in ASD will depend on task complexity. The current study examined this controversy through two priming tasks. one presenting human stimuli (facial expressions) and the other presenting non-human stimuli (animal faces). Both tasks presented visual targets. preceded by congruent. incongruent. or neutral auditory primes. Local and global processing were examined by presenting the visual targets in three spatial frequency conditions: High frequency. low frequency. and broadband. Tasks were administered to 16 adolescents with high functioning ASD and 16 matched typically developing adolescents. Reaction time and accuracy were measured for each task in each condition. Results indicated that individuals with ASD processed context for both human and non-human stimuli. except in one condition. in which human stimuli had to be processed globally (i.e.. target presented in low frequency). The task demands presented in this condition. and the performance deficit shown in the ASD group as a result. could be understood in terms of cognitive overload. These findings provide support for the complexity theory of autism and extend it. Our results also demonstrate how associative priming could support intact context processing of human and non-human stimuli in individuals with ASD. Autism Res2017. 10: 520-530.

52,Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with atypical cortical maturation leading to a deficiency in social cognition and language. Numerous studies have attempted to classify ASD using brain measurements such as cortical thickness. surface area. or volume with promising results. However. the underpowered sample sizes of these studies limit external validity and generalizability at the population level. Large scale collaborations such as Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA) or the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) aim to bring together like-minded scientists to further improve investigations into brain disorders. To the best of our knowledge. this study represents the largest classification analysis for detection of ASD vs. healthy age and sex matched controls using cortical thickness brain parcellations and intracranial volume normalized surface area and subcortical volumes. We were able to increase classification accuracy overall from 56% to 60% and for females only by 6%. These novel findings using Evolving Partitions to Improve Connectomics (EPIC) underscore the importance of large-scale data-driven approaches and collaborations in the discovery of brain disorders....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Autism
53,Machine learning approaches have been widely used for the identification of neuropathology from neuroimaging data. However. these approaches require large samples and suffer from the challenges associated with multi-site. multi-protocol data. We propose a novel approach to address these challenges. and demonstrate its usefulness with the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database. We predict symptom severity based on cortical thickness measurements from 156 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from four different sites. The proposed approach consists of two main stages: a domain adaptation stage using partial least squares regression to maximize the consistency of imaging data across sites; and a learning stage combining support vector regression for regional prediction of severity with elastic-net penalized linear regression for integrating regional predictions into a whole-brain severity prediction. The proposed method performed markedly better than simpler alternatives. better with multi-site than single-site data. and resulted in a considerably higher cross-validated correlation score than has previously been reported in the literature for multi-site data. This demonstration of the utility of the proposed approach for detecting structural brain abnormalities in ASD from the multi-site. multi-protocol ABIDE dataset indicates the potential of designing machine learning methods to meet the challenges of agglomerative data....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Autism
54,Social deficits are a core symptom of autism spectrum disorder; however. the perturbed neural mechanisms underpinning these deficits remain unclear. It has been suggested that social prediction errors-coding discrepancies between the predicted and actual outcome of another's decisions-might play a crucial role in processing social information. While the gyral surface of the anterior cingulate cortex signalled social prediction errors in typically developing individuals. this crucial social signal was altered in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Importantly. the degree to which social prediction error signalling was aberrant correlated with diagnostic measures of social deficits. Effective connectivity analyses further revealed that. in typically developing individuals but not in autism spectrum disorder. the magnitude of social prediction errors was driven by input from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These data provide a novel insight into the neural substrates underlying autism spectrum disorder social symptom severity. and further research into the gyral surface of the anterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex could provide more targeted therapies to help ameliorate social deficits in autism spectrum disorder....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Autism
55,We tested social cognition abilities of adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and neurotypically developed peers (NTD). A multi-faceted test-battery including facial emotion categorization (FEC). classical false belief tasks (FBT). and complex social cognition (SC). yielded significantly lower accuracy rates for FEC and complex SC tasks in ASD. but no significant differences in performance concerning FBT. A significant correlation between age and performance in a FEC task and in a complex task was found only in ASD. We propose that dynamic and/or fragmented FEC tasks can elicit deficits in implicit processing of facial emotion more efficiently. The difficulties of ASD in solving complex SC tasks can be ascribed to deficits in the acquisition and application of social schemata....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
56,Objective Children with autism have sitting and on-task behavior problems in class. In this study. the effect of three alternative classroom-seating devices such as regular classroom chairs. therapy balls. and air cushions were examined on students' classroom behavior. Materials & Methods 15 students with autism participated in this A1-B-A2-C multiple treatments study from Mashhad's Tabasom School. Mashhad. Iran in 2014. Students' behaviors were video recorded in three phases: sitting on their common chairs during phase A. air-sit cushioned in phase B. and ball chairs in phase C. Sitting times and on-task behaviors were quantified by momentary time sampling and compared during different phases for important changes during 8 wk. Additionally. the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale-Second Edition test was used to examine stereotyped movements. social and communication skills of the students in the before and after research. Results Significant increases in in-seat behaviors in 86.7% (thirteen out of 15) of the students and on-task behaviors in 53.3% of the students (eight out of 15) when seated on therapy balls. Air cushions had no significant effects on in-seat/on-task behaviors. The results also showed significant decrease in stereotyped movement and increase in communication and social skills of these students. The teachers also preferred the use of the balls and/ or air-cushioned chairs for their students.

57,People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulties in identifying another person by face and voice. This might contribute considerably to the development of social cognition and interaction difficulties. The characteristics of the voice recognition deficit in ASD are unknown. Here. we used a comprehensive behavioral test battery to systematically investigate voice processing in high-functioning ASD (n=16) and typically developed pair-wise matched controls (n=16). The ASD group had particular difficulties with discriminating. learning. and recognizing unfamiliar voices. while recognizing famous voices was relatively intact. Tests on acoustic processing abilities showed that the ASD group had a specific deficit in vocal pitch perception that was dissociable from otherwise intact acoustic processing (i.e.. musical pitch. musical. and vocal timbre perception). Our results allow a characterization of the voice recognition deficit in ASD: The findings indicate that in high-functioning ASD. the difficulty to recognize voices is particularly pronounced for learning novel voices and the recognition of unfamiliar peoples' voices. This pattern might be indicative of difficulties with integrating the acoustic characteristics of the voice into a coherent percepta function that has been previously associated with voice-selective regions in the posterior superior temporal sulcus/gyrus of the human brain.

58,Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show significant impairments in social skills and theory of mind (ToM). The aim of this study was to evaluate ToM and social information processing abilities in 52 children with ASD compared to 55 typically developing (TD) children. A mediation analysis evaluated whether social information processing abilities can be mediated by ToM competences. In our results. children with autism showed a deficit in social skills and ToM components. The innovative results of our study applying mediation analysis demonstrate that ToM plays a key role in the development of social abilities. and the lack of ToM competences in children with autism impairs their competent social behavior....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
59,Background: Responding to joint attention (RJA) is reduced in young children with ASD despite being vital to the early development of social communication. For this reason. RJA is a frequent target in early intervention programs. Clinical guidelines suggest that exaggerating facial expressions or gestural pointing may improve RJA in children with autism by clarifying the meaning of the gaze or gesture. In the current study. we investigate the effect of intensity of emotional expression on RJA in preschoolers with ASD. Method: Twenty-five preschoolers with ASD and 21 typically developing peers were administered a specifically designed eye-tracking task in which an actor directs attention to a moving object by looking at it with an expression that was either neutral. mildly surprised or intensely surprised. In a supplementary condition. gestural pointing was accompanied by a neutral gaze shift. Results: Commensurate with previous studies. children with ASD oriented less to the face of the actor and were less responsive to RJA when compared to their typically developing peers. However. children with autism differed in their response to RJA according to the different task conditions. They demonstrated more frequent responses to RJA when the actor's facial expression was either intense or supported by gestural pointing. Conclusions: We report initial evidence for the importance of clarifying content cues in order to help preschoolers with autism adhere to receptive joint attention (RJA) opportunities. Our findings inform knowledge about early treatment and attention to emotional expressions in autism and improve our understanding of how early interventions may work to increase RJA in young children with ASD.

60,Aim: Oxytocin presents an exciting potential to target the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) pharmacologically in an easily administered. cost-effective form with possibly minimal adverse effects. But. there are still major gaps in this area of research. This paper reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effects of oxytocin administration on social cognition and restricted. repetitive behaviors in individuals with an ASD. Method: Electronic literature searches were conducted from PsycINFO. PubMed. Web of Knowledge. and EMBASE for RCTs published through June 2015. Results: 12 RCTs were included in this review. 7 out of the 11 studies that examined social cognition reported improvements. Additionally. one out of the 4 studies on restricted. repetitive behaviors. reported improvements following oxytocin administration. However. results from our meta-analyses suggest that oxytocin has no significant effect on these 2 domains. Conclusion: Previous evidence revealed mixed findings about the effects of oxytocin on ASD. Given the limited number of RCTs. our summary of findings on the effectiveness of oxytocin on ASD should still be considered tentative....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Autism
61,The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of the Systematic Observation of Red Flags as an observational level-two screening measure to detect risk for autism spectrum disorder in toddlers when used with a video-recorded administration of the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales. Psychometric properties of the Systematic Observation of Red Flags were examined in a sample of 247 toddlers of 16- to 24months old: 130 with autism spectrum disorder. 61 with developmental delays. and 56 typically developing. Individual items were examined for performance to create an algorithm with improved sensitivity and specificity. yielding a total Composite score and Domain scores for Social Communication and Restricted Repetitive Behaviors. Codes indicating clear symptom presence were collapsed to yield a count of the number of Red Flags for the overall scale and each symptom domain. Results indicated significant group differences with large effects for the Composite. both Domain scores. and Red Flags score. and good discrimination (area under the curve=0.84-0.87) between autism spectrum disorder and nonspectrum groups for the Composite. Social Communication Domain. and Social Communication Red Flags score. The Systematic Observation of Red Flags provides an observational screening measure for 16- to 24-month-olds with good discrimination. sensitivity. and specificity. A cutoff of 20 on the Composite is recommended to optimally detect autism spectrum disorder risk....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Child abuse
62,It has been recognized that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show discrepancies between their abstract capacities to solve social cognition dilemmas and their ability to spontaneously decipher live social interactions. In the last 15 years. different paradigms have been designed to investigate how individuals with ASD grasp information when emerged in naturalistic or live social interactions. The present paper reviews three categories of such paradigms that focus on (1) verbal questionnaires and interviews while participants view a naturalistic social scenario. (2) eye tracking methods while participants view naturalistic settings. and (3) simulation of social interactions using virtual reality or robotics. This paper discusses the advantages and limitations of each paradigm and suggests a new concept for combining these paradigms....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
63,Autism is characterised by difficulties in social functioning. notably in interactions with other people. Yet. most studies addressing social difficulties have used static images or. at best. videos of social stimuli. with no scope for real interaction. Here. we study one crucial aspect of social interactionsgaze behaviourin an interactive setting. First. typical individuals were shown videos of an experimenter and. by means of a deception procedure. were either led to believe that the experimenter was present via a live video-feed or was pre-recorded. Participants' eye movements revealed that when passively viewing an experimenter they believed to be live. they looked less at that person than when they believed the experimenter video was pre-recorded. Interestingly. this reduction in viewing behaviour in response to the believed live presence of the experimenter was absent in individuals high in autistic traits. suggesting a relative insensitivity to social presence alone. When participants were asked to actively engage in a real-time interaction with the experimenter. however. high autistic trait individuals looked significantly less at the experimenter relative to low autistic trait individuals. The results reinforce findings of atypical gaze behaviour in individuals high in autistic traits. but suggest that active engagement in a social interaction may be important in eliciting reduced looking. We propose that difficulties with the spatio-temporal dynamics associated with real social interactions rather than underlying difficulties processing the social stimulus itself may drive these effects. The results underline the importance of developing ecologically valid methods to investigate social cognition. Autism Res2017. 10: 359-368.

64,To assess the impact of their child's symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder upon parents' anxiety and depression. 68 mothers of boys aged 10 to 15 years (M = 12.6 years. SD = 1.6 years) completed the ASD Behaviour Checklist. the GAD7 and the PHQ9 at a single setting. Results indicated that the boys' restricted and repetitive behaviours had the strongest relationship with their mothers' anxiety and depression. followed by communication difficulties. but the latter set of behaviours did not significantly add to the variance predicted by restricted and repetitive behaviours. Their sons' intense reactions to stressors was the most powerful ASD-related contributor to the anxiety and depression experienced by these mothers. Several suggestions for enhancing parental coping with this aspect of their child's ASD behavioural symptomatology are discussed....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Depression
65,Background: Although children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are more likely to be exposed to harsh parental discipline. research on this issue is scarce. In particular. few studies have examined the risk factors for harsh parental discipline in this population. We responded to this gap in the literature by testing multiple individual and environmental factors as potential predictors of parental psychological aggression and physical assault toward children with ASD. Guided by a developmental-ecological perspective. we hypothesized that harsh parental discipline would be shaped by the characteristics of the child (symptom severity). the parent (parenting stress). the family (economic pressure). and the broader context (discrimination in the community). Method: A total of 424 Hong Kong parents of children with ASD completed standardized questionnaires. The hypotheses were tested using bivariate correlation and multivariate regression analyses. Results: At the bivariate level. child symptom severity. parenting stress. family economic pressure. and experienced discrimination were positively associated with parental psychological aggression. Moreover. child symptom severity and parenting stress were positively associated with parental physical assault. At the multivariate level. parenting stress was significantly related to psychological aggression. while child symptom severity and parenting stress were significantly related to physical assault. Mediation analyses further demonstrated that psychological aggression partially mediated the effect of parenting stress on physical assault. Conclusions: Theoretically. our findings contributed to our understanding of the origin of harsh parenting practices toward children with ASD. Practically. our findings provided insights about ways to identify high-risk families and to develop effective child maltreatment intervention programs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

66,Electrophysiologic studies suggest that autism spectrum disorder is characterized by aberrant anatomic and functional neural circuitry. During normal brain development. pruning and synaptogenesis facilitate ongoing changes in both short- and long-range neural wiring. In developmental disorders such as autism. this process may be perturbed and lead to abnormal neural connectivity. Careful analysis of electrophysiologic connectivity patterns using EEG coherence may provide a way to probe the resulting differences in neurological function between people with and without autism. There is general consensus that electroencephalogram coherence patterns differ between individuals with and without autism spectrum disorders; however. the exact nature of the differences and their clinical significance remain unclear. Here we review recent literature comparing electroencephalogram coherence patterns between patients with autism spectrum disorders or at high risk for autism and their non-autistic or low-risk for autism peers....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Autism
67,Detecting where our partners direct their gaze is an important aspect of social interaction. An atypical gaze processing has been reported in autism. However. it remains controversial whether children and adults with autism spectrum disorder interpret indirect gaze direction with typical accuracy. This study investigated whether the detection of gaze direction toward an object is less accurate in autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (n=33) and intelligence quotients-matched and age-matched controls (n=38) were asked to watch a series of synthetic faces looking at objects. and decide which of two objects was looked at. The angle formed by the two possible targets and the face varied following an adaptive procedure. in order to determine individual thresholds. We found that gaze direction detection was less accurate in autism spectrum disorder than in control participants. Our results suggest that the precision of gaze following may be one of the altered processes underlying social interaction difficulties in autism spectrum disorder....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Person perception
68,Interoceptive awareness is linked to emotional and social cognition. which are impaired in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It is unknown how this ability is associated with age in either typical or atypical development. We used a standard test of interoceptive accuracy (IA) to investigate these questions in children and adults with and without ASD. Perceived number of heartbeats over 4 time intervals was compared with actual heart rate to determine IA. Effects of group. age. IQ. heart rate. and mental counting ability on accuracy were assessed using multiple regression. Post hoc correlations were performed to clarify significant interactions. Age was unrelated to IA in both groups when IQ >= 115. When IQ < 115. this relationship was positive in typical development and negative in ASD. These results suggest that cognitive ability moderates the effect of age on IA differently in autism and typical development....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
69,Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is sexually dimorphic in brain structure. genetics. and behaviors. In studies of brain tissue. the age of the population is clearly a factor in interpreting study outcome. yet sex is rarely considered. To begin to address this issue. we extend our previously published microarray analyses to examine expression of small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs). including microRNAs (miRNAs). in ASD and in the control temporal cortex in males and females. Predicted miRNA targets were identified as well as the pathways they overpopulate. Findings: After considering age. sexual dimorphism in ASD sncRNA expression persists in the temporal cortex and in the patterning that distinguishes regions. Among the sexually dimorphic miRNAs are miR-219 and miR-338. which promote oligodendrocyte differentiation. miR-125. implicated in neuronal differentiation. and miR-488. implicated in anxiety. Putative miRNA targets are significantly over-represented in immune and nervous system pathways in both sexes. consistent with previous mRNA studies. Even for common pathways. the specific target mRNAs are often sexually dimorphic. For example. both male and female target genes significantly populate the Axonal Guidance Signaling pathway. yet less than a third of the targets are common to both sexes. Conclusions: Our findings of sexual dimorphism in sncRNA levels underscore the importance of considering sex. in addition to age. when interpreting molecular findings on ASD brain....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Autism
70,Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been associated with reduced orienting to social stimuli such as eyes. but the results are inconsistent. It is not known whether atypicalities in phasic alerting could play a role in putative altered social orienting in ASD. Here. we show that in unisensory (visual) trials. children with ASD are slower to orient to eyes (among distractors) than controls matched for age. sex. and nonverbal IQ. However. in another condition where a brief spatially nonpredictive sound was presented just before the visual targets. this group effect was reversed. Our results indicate that orienting to social versus nonsocial stimuli is differently modulated by phasic alerting mechanisms in young children with ASD. Autism Res2017. 10: 246-250.

71,Background: Early research has documented that young children show an increased interest toward objects that are verbally labeled by an adult. compared to objects that are presented without a label. It is unclear whether the same phenomenon occurs in neurodevelopmental disorders affecting social development. such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Williams syndrome (WS). Methods: The present study used a novel eye-tracking paradigm to determine whether hearing a verbal label increases the salience of novel objects in 35 preschoolers with ASD. 18 preschoolers with WS. and 20 typically developing peers. Results: We found that typically developing children and those with WS. but not those with ASD. spent significantly more time looking at objects that are verbally labeled by an adult. compared to objects that are presented without a label. Conclusions: In children without ASD. information accompanied by the speaker's verbal label is accorded a "special status." and it is more likely to be attended to. In contrast. children with ASD do not appear to attribute a special salience to labeled objects compared to non-labeled objects. This result is consistent with the notion that reduced responsivity to pedagogical cues hinders social learning in young children with ASD....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
72,Background The incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in Sardinia is among the highest in the world (44.8 cases/100.000 person-years). Recommendations of the Immunology of Diabetes Society advise evaluating autoantibody positivity in first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with T1DM. for their higher risk to develop the disease. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of beta-cell autoimmunity in FDRs of T1DM patients in Sardinia. Methods A total of 188 Sardinian families were recruited in collaboration between diabetes and pediatric units of university and district hospitals in Sardinia. The recruitment involved 188 patients with diagnosed T1DM and all their available FDRs (n = 447). Autoantibodies (Aabs) against GAD. IA2. insulin. and ZnT8 were measured in all subjects. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) risk genotypes (HLA-DR and DQ loci) were analyzed in 43 Aabs-positive FDR. Results The prevalence of Aabs (any type of autoantibody. single or multiple) in FDR was 11.9% (53/447). Of those with autoantibodies. 62.3% (33/53) were positive to only 1 autoantibody. 22.6% (12/53) had 2 autoantibodies. 7.55% (4/53) had 3 autoantibodies. and 7.55% (4/53) had all 4 autoantibodies. Typing of HLA-DR and DQ loci showed that 89% of FDR carried moderate-to high-risk genotypes. with only 5 FDR with low-risk genotypes. Conclusions The prevalence of T1DM autoantibodies in FDRs of T1DM patients was very high (11.9%) in the Sardinian population. higher than in other populations from the United States and Europe. and similar to that observed in Finland. Autoantibody positivity strongly associated with HLA risk. This study provides evidence of the high risk of T1DM in FDR of T1DM patients in Sardinia and warrants longitudinal follow-up to estimate the risk of progression to T1DM in high-risk populations....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Diabetes
73,Objective: To evaluate the role of auto-antibodies in Chinese patients with primary and secondary infertility in routine clinical practice. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of infertile Chinese patients of either gender (>= 18 year old) who were failed to conceive after 12 months of regular sexual intercourse without the use of contraception. and visited at department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics. Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. China between January 2004 to December 2014. and undergone auto-antibody estimation along with other routine antenatal screening tests. Immunological assay was performed using dot immuno-gold filtration assay. Positive case was compared among patients with primary and secondary infertility. Results: Our chart review study showed that the positive case of Anti-Sperm Antibody (ASAb) was significantly higher in female with primary than male (p<0.05). In female patients with primary infertility. all other auto-antibodies (anti-Endometrium Antibody (EMAb). Anti-Ovary Antibody (AOAb). Anti-Zona Pellucida Antibody (AZP)) and Anti-Cardiolipin Antibody (ACA) were significantly higher compared to patients with secondary infertility (p<0.05). Moreover. positive case of all auto-antibodies was significantly higher among female with primary fertility than secondary fertility and control groups. Conclusion: Our study results suggested the involvement of auto-antibodies related to reproduction system in development of primary infertility. Auto-antibodies related to reproduction were significantly higher in patients with primary infertility. this implicated involvement of auto-immunological factors in development of infertility....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Ankylosing Spondylitis
74,Objective The objective of this study was to investigate fatigue and cognitive impairments in systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) in relation to diffuse white matter microstructural brain damage. Methods Diffusion tensor MRI. used to generate biomarkers of brain white matter microstructural integrity. was obtained in patients with SLE and age-matched controls. Fatigue and cognitive function were assessed and related to SLE activity. clinical data and plasma biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Results Fifty-one patients with SLE (mean age 48.814.3 years) were included. Mean diffusivity (MD) was significantly higher in all white matter fibre tracts in SLE patients versus age-matched healthy controls (p<0.0001). Fatigue in SLE was higher than a normal reference range (p<0.0001) and associated with lower MD (ss=-0.61. p=0.02). depression (ss=0.17. p=0.001). anxiety (ss=0.13. p=0.006) and higher body mass index (ss=0.10. p=0.004) in adjusted analyses. Poorer cognitive function was associated with longer SLE disease duration (p=0.003) and higher MD (p=0.03) and. in adjusted analysis. higher levels of IL-6 (ss=-0.15. p=0.02) but not with MD. Meta-analysis (10 studies. n=261. including the present study) confirmed that patients with SLE have higher MD than controls. Conclusion Patients with SLE have more microstructural brain white matter damage for age than the general population. but this does not explain increased fatigue or lower cognition in SLE. The association between raised IL-6 and worse current cognitive function in SLE should be explored in larger datasets....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Rheumatoid Arthritis
75,Objectives: Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a representative IgG4-related and inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. To clarify mechanisms of carcinogenesis resulting from AIP. we focused on methylation abnormalities and KRAS mutations in AIP. Methods: Six tumor suppressor genes (NPTX2. Cyclin D2. FOXE1. TFPI2. ppENK. and p16) that exhibited hypermethylation in pancreatic carcinoma were selected for quantitative SYBR green methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in 10 AIP specimens. 10 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cases without history of AIP containing carcinoma areas (CAs) and noncarcinoma areas (NCAs). and 11 normal pancreas (NP) samples. KRAS mutation in codons 12. 13. and 61 were also investigated using direct sequencing. Results: Hypermethylation events (>= 10%) were identified in NPTX2. Cyclin D2. FOXE1. TFPI2. ppENK. and p16 in 1. 2. 2. 0. 2. and 0 CA cases. respectively. but not in these 6 candidate genes in AIP. NCA. and NP. However. the TFPI2 methylation ratio was significantly higher in AIP than NCA and NP. Direct sequencing results for KRAS showed no single-point mutations in AIP. Conclusions: These are the first studies characterizing methylation abnormalities in AIP. AIP's inflammatory condition may be related to carcinogenesis. Further study will elucidate methylation abnormalities associated with carcinogenesis in AIP....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
76,The process of curing a patient by removing his illness by extracting blood is a very old one. Many years ago. phlebotomy was practiced to cure illness. Now. this old process. placed on a rational basis with therapeutic apheresis (TA). is being followed in clinical practice. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) with hollow fiber modules has been used in different severe diseases for more than 40 years. Based on many years of experience with the extracorporeal circulation in end-stage renal disease. the authors herein give an overview of TA in immunological diseases. especially in hematologic. autoimmune and dermatologic diseases. Updated information on immunology and molecular biology of different immunological diseases is discussed in relation to the rationale for apheresis therapy and its place in combination with other modern therapies. With the introduction of novel and effective biologic agents. TA is indicated only in severe cases. such as in rapid progression despite immunosuppressive therapy and/or biologic agents. In mild forms of autoimmune disease. treatment with immunosuppressive therapies and/or biologic agents seems to be sufficient. The prognosis of autoimmune diseases with varying organ manifestations has improved in recent years. due in part to very aggressive therapy schemes. For the immunological diseases that can be treated with TA. the guidelines of the German Working Group of Clinical Nephrology and of the Apheresis Applications Committee of the American Society for Apheresis are cited. TA has been shown to effectively remove the autoantibodies from blood and lead to rapid clinical improvement....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Rheumatoid Arthritis
77,Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) represent a new revolutionary weapon in the armamentarium of anti-cancer therapies. The side effects of these new agents represent a new challenge for oncologists; they are usually unpredictable and sometimes life threatening. if not managed rapidly and adequately. The most frequent side effects are the dermatologic. but they are usually low grade side effects and consequently easily manageable. Rash. pruritus and vitiligo are the most frequent dermatologic side effects. We aimed in this review to describe first all the dermatologic side effects of ICI according to the subtype of ICI and combination therapies in the clinical trials. then to report all the rare case reports dermatologic side effects. and finally to present the management algorithm of these side effects....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Cancer
78,Blood transcriptional profiles could serve as biomarkers of clinical changes in subjects at-risk for or diagnosed with diabetes. However. transcriptional variation over time is poorly understood due to the impracticality of frequent longitudinal phlebotomy in large patient cohorts. We have developed a novel transcriptome assessment method that could be applied to fingerstick blood samples self-collected by study volunteers. FifteenL of blood from a fingerstick yielded sufficient RNA to analyse >176 transcripts by high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We enrolled 13 subjects with type 1 diabetes and 14 controls to perform weekly collections at home for a period of 6 months. Subjects returned an average of 24 of 26 total weekly samples. and transcript data were obtained successfully for >99% of samples returned. A high degree of correlation between fingerstick data and data from a standard 3 mL venipuncture sample was observed. Increases in interferon-stimulated gene expression were associated with self-reported respiratory infections. indicating that real-world transcriptional changes can be detected using this assay. In summary. we show that longitudinal monitoring of gene expression is feasible using ultra-low-volume blood samples self-collected by study participants at home. and can be used to monitor changes in gene expression frequently over extended periods....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Diabetes
79,The importance of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity is highlighted in murine models of immunodeficiency and in many human pathologies. However. the true extent of TCR diversity and how this diversity varies in health and disease is poorly understood. In a previous issue of the European Journal of Immunology. Lossius et al. [Eur. J. Immunol. 2014. 44: 3439-3452] dissected the composition of the TCR repertoire in the context of multiple sclerosis (MS) using high-throughput sequencing of TCR-beta chains in cerebrospinal fluid samples and blood. The authors demonstrated that the TCR repertoire of the CSF was largely distinct from the blood and enriched in EBV-reactive CD8(+) T cells in MS patients. Studies of this kind have long been hindered by technical limitations and remain scarce in the literature. However. TCR sequencing methodologies are progressing apace and will undoubtedly shed light on the genetic basis of T-cell responses and the ontogeny of T-cell-mediated diseases. such as MS....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Multiple Sclerosis
80,Objectives: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection induces production of CD13-specific autoantibodies. which may promote inflammation and tissue damage. HCMV infection has been suggested as a cause of biliary atresia (BA). but little is known of its role in other forms of neonatal cholestasis. We studied serum levels of CD13-specific autoantibodies in mothers of infants with neonatal cholestasis of different causes. including BA. and in mothers of healthy. term infants without cholestasis. as well as in healthy blood donors. Methods: Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. we measured CD13-specific autoantibody levels in serum from the above-mentioned groups. In addition. the effect of serum from mothers of infants with neonatal cholestasis was tested on the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. Results: CD13-specific autoantibodies were found in mothers of infants with neonatal cholestasis. but not in mothers of infants without cholestasis and healthy blood donors. and were associated with HCMV seropositivity. Sera from mothers of infants with all forms of neonatal cholestasis inhibited differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. but this was not dependent on CD13-specific autoantibodies. Conclusions: The significantly higher frequency of CD13-specific autoantibodies in mothers of infants with neonatal cholestasis of all forms compared with mothers of healthy infants without cholestasis suggests an association. but does not prove that they are pathogenic. The presence of CD13-specific autoantibodies does not correlate with HCMV IgG serostatus. suggesting a more complicated mechanism that possibly reflects active HCMV infection in these individuals. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether these autoantibodies contribute to the development of cholestasis or represent an epiphenomenon....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Hepatitis C
81,In physiological circumstances. various tolerogenic mechanisms support the protection of self-structures during immune responses. However. quantitative and/or qualitative changes in regulatory immune cells and mediators can evoke auto-reactive immune responses. and upon susceptible genetic background. along with the presence of other concomitant etiological factors. autoimmune disease may develop. In transplant immunology. tolerogenic mechanisms are also critical. since the balance between of alloantigen-reactive effector cells and the regulatory immune cells will ultimately determine whether a graft is accepted or rejected. Better understanding of the immunological tolerance and the potential modulations of immune regulatory processes are crucial for developing effective therapies in autoimmune diseases as well as in organ transplantation. In this review. we focus on the novel insights regarding the impaired immune regulation and other relevant factors contributing to the development of auto-reactive and graft-reactive immune responses in autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection. respectively. We also address some promising approaches for modification of immune-regulatory processes and tolerogenic mechanisms in autoimmunity and solid organ transplantation. which may be beneficial in future therapeutic strategies.

82,Background: Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) represent a growing number of monogenic. polygenic or multifactorial disorders that are often difficult to diagnose. Case presentation: Here we report a patient who was initially erroneously diagnosed and treated for SAID. Symptoms consisted of recurrent fever. erythematous and/or blistering skin lesions. angioedema. susceptibility to bleeding. external ear infections and reversible anisocoria in the absence of laboratory evidence of systemic inflammation. After two and a half years of extensive diagnostic work-up and multiple empirical therapies. a final diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy syndrome (MBPS) was established. Conclusions: The diagnosis of SAID needs to be carefully reassessed if measurable systemic inflammation is missing. and MBPS should be included in the differential diagnosis....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Psoriatic Arthritis
83,The human microbiome consists of all microorganisms occupying the skin. mucous membranes and intestinal tract of the human body. The contact of the mucosal immune system with the human microbiome is a balanced interplay between defence mechanisms of the immune system and symbiotic or pathogenic microbial factors. such as microbial antigens and metabolites. In systemic autoimmune diseases (SADs) such as rheumatoid arthritis. systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome. the immune system is deranged to a chronic inflammatory state and autoantibodies are an important hallmark. Specific bacteria and/or a dysbiosis in the human microbiome can lead to local mucosal inflammation and increased intestinal permeability. Proinflammatory lymphocytes and cytokines can spread to the systemic circulation and increase the risk of inflammation at distant anatomical sites. such as the joints or salivary glands. Increased intestinal permeability increases antigen exposure and the risk of autoantibody production. If the human microbiome indeed plays such a critical role in SADs. this finding holds a great promise for new therapeutic strategies. such as diet interventions and probiotics and prebiotics. This review provides a background on the human microbiome and mucosal immunity in the gut and oral cavity and gives a summary of the current knowledge on the microbiome-SADs connection....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Rheumatoid Arthritis
84,The paper deals with a hardware solution for the study of low power active filter with Bode plotting. By using a DAQ card and an experimental platform it shows how LabVIEW graphical programming environment can be used for manual or automated testing and analysis of the first order active filter with operational amplifier (op-amp). The hardware platform can provide a template to build real op-amp circuits to better understand (together with a previous one paper for developing the software simulation and demonstrations) the op-amp filters principles. The main contribution for this paper refers to a software / hardware solution for obtaining a manual / automat Bode plotting. For plotting the frequency response curve of a filters. it is often necessary to measure the output signal over a range of input frequency. The hardware experiments allows a range of test voltages with variable frequency to be input and the filters response measured. displayed and analyzed. The frequency scan range. scan rate and number of test points can be selected from front panel controls. Another contribution is a practical tool for the analysis of the response filter to various input signals (sine / square / triangular wave) and calculating the filter gain depending on the amplitude measured in units of peak. peak to peak or roots mean square signal level....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Operational amplifier
85,In the present paper a novel automatic gain control pre-amplifier for hearing aid device is proposed and analyzed. The proposed design utilizes feedback and feed forward loop in order to control the gain of the device. Input and output thresholds have been accommodated to provide dual control. The weak input signal is amplified in three modes. High gain for low input and low gain for high input forms the basis of amplification. The measured average power dissipation of the complete pre-amplifier is 410 mu W with a dual power supply of +/- 0.7 V in 180 nm technology node. Frequency of operation is up to 20 kHz....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
86,Mixed-signal integrated circuit design and simulation highly rely on behavioral models of circuit blocks. Such models are used for the validation of design specification. optimization of system topology. and behavioral synthesis using a description language. etc. However. automatic behavioral model generation is still in its early stages; in most scenarios designers are responsible for creating behavioral models manually. which is time-consuming and error prone. In this paper an automatic behavioral model generation method for switched-capacitor (SC) integrator is proposed. This technique is based on symbolic circuit modeling with approximation. by which parametric behavioral integrator model can be generated. Such parametric models can be used in circuit design subject to severe process variational. It is demonstrated that the automatically generated integrator models can accurately capture process variation effects on arbitrarily selected circuit elements; furthermore. they can be applied to behavioral simulation of SC Sigma-Delta modulators (SDMs) with acceptable accuracy and speedup. The generated models are compared to a recently proposed manually generated behavioral integrator model in several simulation settings....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
87,Technology is rapidly changing the nature of service. customers' service frontline experiences. and customers' relationships with service providers. Based on the prediction that in the marketplace of 2025. technology (e. g.. service-providing humanoid robots) will be melded into numerous service experiences. this article spotlights technology's ability to engage customers on a social level as a critical advancement of technology infusions. Specifically. it introduces the novel concept of automated social presence (ASP; i. e.. the extent to which technology makes customers feel the presence of another social entity) to the services literature. The authors develop a typology that highlights different combinations of automated and human social presence in organizational frontlines and indicates literature gaps. thereby emphasizing avenues for future research. Moreover. the article presents a conceptual framework that focuses on (a) how the relationship between ASP and several key service and customer outcomes is mediated by social cognition and perceptions of psychological ownership as well as (b) three customer-related factors that moderate the relationship between ASP and social cognition and psychological ownership (i. e.. a customer's relationship orientation. tendency to anthropomorphize. and technology readiness). Finally. propositions are presented that can be a catalyst for future work to enhance the understanding of how technology infusion. particularly service robots. influences customers' frontline experiences in the future....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
88,Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated a close and bidirectional association between depression and cardiovascular disorders (CVD). This comorbidity places a significant burden on individuals and the healthcare system. Not surprisingly. in the last two decades preclinical research in the field of depression and CVD has rapidly progressed. Multiple studies have demonstrated that aspects of human depression/cardiovascular comorbidity can be modeled in rodents exposed to chronic stress paradigms and that a depressive-like syndrome can be induced in rodent models of CVD. This research has provided insights into neural. autonomic. humoral. immune and circulatory mechanisms linking cooccurring mood and CVD. Recent investigations have started to address gender and individual differences in the vulnerability to both disorders and have begun to explore the efficacy of novel pharmacological interventions for the treatment of these comorbid conditions. This review discusses relatively wellestablished findings and the latest discoveries from rodent models of depression and CVD. with the aim of providing an up-to-date reference which may guide future studies of the relationship between mood and cardiovascular disturbances.

89,Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating event for individuals. who frequently develop motor and sensory impairment as well as autonomic dysfunction. Previous studies reported that autonomic activity plays a major role in social cognition and that difficulties in the ability to interpret social information are commonly observed in a variety of mental disorders. which in turn correlate with a poor autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation. It is well established that subjects with SCI have an alteration in ANS regulation mechanisms. We hypothesized that subjects diagnosed with SCI. who are experiencing a period of adaptation and socio-labor insertion suffer alterations in an emotion recognition task. a component of social cognition. which correlate with poor ANS regulation. We evaluated ANS function by measuring the heart rate variability (HRV) in 18 healthy subjects and 10 subjects with SCI. A 5-min baseline HRV was compared to a task period while performing The reading the mind in the eyes test (RMET). We found that while both groups have similar general performance in the test. healthy subjects responded with greater certainty during the RMET. This level of certainty during the RMET was positively correlated with baseline HRV measures in this group. Also. the group of healthy subjects exhibited higher HRV at baseline than participants with SCI. Finally. the changes in HRV between baseline and task condition were significantly higher in healthy individuals than in SCI participants. Our results show that patients with SCI have low levels of autonomic regulation mechanisms which may promote social cognition problems during their reinsertion to daily life....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Autism
90,Filamentous plant pathogens deliver effector proteins to host cells to promote infection. The Phytophthora infestans RXLR-type effector PexRD54 binds potato ATG8 via its ATG8 family-interacting motif (AIM) and perturbs host-selective autophagy. However. the structural basis of this interaction remains unknown. Here. we define the crystal structure of PexRD54. which includes a modular architecture. including five tandem repeat domains. with the AIM sequence presented at the disordered C terminus. To determine the interface between PexRD54 and ATG8. we solved the crystal structure of potato ATG8CL in complex with a peptide comprising the effector's AIM sequence. and we established a model of the full-length PexRD54-ATG8CL complex using small angle x-ray scattering. Structure-informed deletion of the PexRD54 tandem domains reveals retention of ATG8CL binding in vitro and in planta. This study offers new insights into structure/function relationships of oomycete RXLR effectors and how these proteins engage with host cell targets to promote disease....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Immunology
91,Edwin M. Southern is a professor emeritus at the University of Oxford. He is perhaps best known for development of the Southern blot (Dr. Southern was at the University of Edinburgh when he wrote his landmark paper). The Southern blot provided a scientific breakthrough by allowing scientists to detect a particular DNA sequence without first purifying it from the rest of the genome; the basic method involves the transfer of the DNA to a membrane. followed by detection with a specific probe. Although few people perform Southern blots as originally carried out by Southern. due in part to the more recent technique of the polymerase chain reaction. the basic concept continues to play an important role in molecular biology....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Southern blotting

93,A novel nonparametric system identification (SI) algorithm is described. focusing on PID-based control loops for buck converters with effective series resistance (ESR) in the output filter. Dithering amplification effects on the control path are exploited during the steady-state converter operation. The noise injected is used to stimulate the loop reaction and to identify the output filter configuration. Oversampling-dithering features of third-order Delta Sigma modulators are used to increase the DPWM resolution during the converter nominal operation and. moreover. as the core key to compute the SI algorithm. A modified structure of a noise shaper is used to handle the resolution of the SI algorithm over a range of the desired frequencies during the nonparametric identification. The SI algorithm comprises two steps: the first processing step extracts the resonant frequency. and the second extracts the ESR zero from the power spectrum density computation of the control feedback error. The SI method has been validated with different buck converter configurations. and has successfully been integrated and measured into a digitally controlled buck converters prototype for automotive safety application....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,System identification
94,Lignocellulosic biomass gasification followed by the Fischer-Tropsch (Fe) synthesis is becoming a promising pathway to produce synthetic biofuels. having the potential of being coupled with combined-cycle strategies in order to coproduce electricity. In this work. the thermodynamic performance of this type of bioenergy system is evaluated through exergy analysis. A base-case process combining biomass gasification. FT synthesis and a combined cycle is defined. Furthermore. two alternative configurations modifying the base-case process are considered: (i) autothermal reforming (ATR) of a fraction of the FT tail gas to increase the fuel yield. and (ii) combustion of a fraction of the conditioned biosyngas to increase electricity production. The biomass conversion plants are simulated using Aspen Plus (R) to obtain the data required for the assessment. The indirect gasifier and the gas combustor are identified as the main sources of irreversibility within the three process configurations. with exergy destruction ratios of 21% and 5-7%. respectively. The gasification subsystem is found to contribute over 50% to the overall exergy destruction. showing 68% efficiency. The power generation subsystem also shows a high contribution to the overall exergy destruction (19-28%) due to high fuel consumption and the significant thermodynamic irreversibility of the cycle. Depending on the plant configuration. overall exergetic efficiencies of 24-27% are attained. The ATR case leads to a higher yield of biofuels. at the expense of lower electricity production. This configuration enhances the exergetic efficiency of the system and thus its thermodynamic performance. in contrast to the alternative configuration for increased power generation.

95,An auto-zero and chopper operational amplifier with a 4.5-60 V supply voltage range is realized. using a 0.18 mu m CMOS process augmented by 5 V CMOS and 60 V DMOS transistors. It achieves a maximum offset voltage drift of 0.02 mu V/degrees C. a minimum CMRR of 145 dB. a noise PSD of 6.8 nV/root Hz. and a 3.1 MHz unity gain bandwidth. while dissipating 840 mu A of current. Up-modulated chopper ripple is suppressed by auto-zeroing. Furthermore. glitches from the charge injection of the input switches are mitigated by employing six parallel input stages with 800 kHz interleaved clocks. This moves the majority of the glitch energy up to 4.8 MHz. while leaving little energy at 800 kHz. As a result. the requirements on an external low-pass glitch filter is relaxed. and a wider usable signal bandwidth can be obtained. Maximum input bias current due to charge injection mismatch is reduced from 1.5 nA to 150 pA by post production trimming with an on-chip charge mismatch compensation circuit....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Operational amplifier
96,Short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (SCEH) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the oxidation of fatty acids and the catabolic pathway of valine and. to a lesser extent. isoleucine. Deficiency of this enzyme was recently shown to cause an early childhood Leigh syndrome phenotype. The few reported patients were compound heterozygotes for two missense or missense with truncating variants in ECHS1 that encodes SCEH. We describe two siblings with severe refractory lactic acidosis and death within the first 2 days of life. Following negative clinical whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing. we resorted to autozygome/exome analysis on research basis and identified a homozygous splice site mutation (c.88+5G>A) in the two cases. Analysis of cDNA confirmed complete replacement of the normal transcript with an aberrant transcript (r.88_89ins 88+1_88+11) predicting premature truncation of the protein [p.(Ala31Glufs*23)]. Furthermore. quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) showed marked reduction in ECHS1. most likely nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)-mediated. This is the first report of homozygosity for a truncating mutation in ECHS1. which may explain the severe phenotype. Our report highlights the need to consider SCEH deficiency in patients with lethal neonatal lactic acidosis. and the potentially limited sensitivity of untargeted genomic sequencing towards non-canonical splicing mutations. which may explain at least some of the negative' cases on clinical exome/genome sequencing....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Alzheimer's Disease
97,This review presents a broader approach to the implementation and study of runs of homozygosity (ROH) in animal populations. focusing on identifying and characterizing ROH and their practical implications. ROH are continuous homozygous segments that are common in individuals and populations. The ability of these homozygous segments to give insight into a population's genetic events makes them a useful tool that can provide information about the demographic evolution of a population over time. Furthermore. ROH provide useful information about the genetic relatedness among individuals. helping to minimize the inbreeding rate and also helping to expose deleterious variants in the genome. The frequency. size and distribution of ROH in the genome are influenced by factors such as natural and artificial selection. recombination. linkage disequilibrium. population structure. mutation rate and inbreeding level. Calculating the inbreeding coefficient from molecular information from ROH (F-ROH) is more accurate for estimating autozygosity and for detecting bothpast and more recent inbreeding effects than are estimates from pedigree data (F-PED). The better results of F-ROH suggest that F-ROH can be used to infer information about the history and inbreeding levels of a population in the absence of genealogical information. The selection of superior animals has produced large phenotypic changes and has reshaped the ROH patterns in various regions of the genome. Additionally. selection increases homozygosity around the target locus. and deleterious variants are seen to occur more frequently in ROH regions. Studies involving ROH are increasingly common and provide valuable information about how the genome's architecture can disclose a population's genetic background. By revealing the molecular changes in populations over time. genome-wide information is crucial to understanding antecedent genome architecture and. therefore. to maintaining diversity and fitness in endangered livestock breeds....,Psychology,biochemistry,Depression,Genetics
98,This paper introduces a new voltage regulator module (VRM) that merges a highly efficient switched-inductor converter as the main unit with a load-side switched-capacitor-based converter to assist during load transient events. The resulting hybrid-VRM exhibits improved dynamic performance for both loading and unloading transient events. while maintaining a compact design with reduced output capacitance and lower components stress. The hybrid controller that has been developed allows operation that is based on output voltage measurement alone. further reducing the circuit complexity. A power processing efficiency analysis that has been carried out shows efficiency improvement in favor of the hybrid-VRM when compared to time-optimal control under varying load conditions. The operation of the VRM is verified on a 20-W. 12V-to-1.5-V prototype with peak power conversion efficiency of 93%. demonstrating near-ideal transient recovery....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Single-phase electric power
99,In some high-performance applications. an LC filter must be added to the auxiliary resonant snubber inverter (ARSI) to reduce the output current ripple. However. resonance occurs due to the additional LC filter. which makes the traditional closed-loop control not suitable to be used directly. Therefore. this paper presents a double-loop digital control based on the active damping method of capacitor current feedback to stabilize the system. Most of the studies on active damping methods are focused on the grid in consideration of zero resistance. However. the load resistance should not be neglected in the drive system. Therefore. the load resistance and digital control delays are considered in this paper. Moreover. an improved loading method is proposed to improve the duty ratio range. In order to verify the effectiveness of the controller. a prototype was developed. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that soft-switching can be realized for the entire load range. The maximum duty ratio is improved by 0.01 by using the proposed loading method. The resonance can be eliminated by using the proposed control method....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
0,We report the cloning of a glycoside hydrolase family (GHF) 9 gene of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Sasanishiki). OsCel9A. corresponding to the auxin-induced 51 kDa endo-1.4-beta-glucanase (EGase). This enzyme reveals a broad substrate specificity with respect to sugar backbones (glucose and xylose) in beta-1.4-glycans of type II cell wall. OsCel9A encodes a 640 amino acid polypeptide and is an ortholog of TomCel8. a tomato EGase containing a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) 2 sequence at its C-terminus. The expression of four rice EGase genes including OsCel9A showed different patterns of organ specificity and responses to auxin. OsCel9A was preferentially expressed during the initiation of lateral roots or subcultured root calli. but was hardly expressed during auxin-induced coleoptile elongation or in seed calli. in contrast to OsCel9D. a KORRIGAN (KOR) homolog. In situ localization of OsCel9A transcripts demonstrated that its expression was specifically up-regulated in lateral root primordia (LRP). Northern blotting analysis showed the presence of a single product of OsCel9A. In contrast. both mass spectrometric analyses of peptide fragments from purified 51 kDa EGase proteins and immunogel blot analysis of EGase proteins in root extracts using two antibodies against internal peptide sequences of OsCel9A revealed that the entire CBM2 region was post-translationally truncated from the 67 kDa nascent protein to generate 51 kDa EGase isoforms. Analyses of auxin concentration and time course dependence of accumulation of two EGase isoforms suggested that the translation and post-translational CBM2 truncation of the OsCel9A gene may participate in lateral root development....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Enzymology
1,This paper proposes a digital phase leading filter current compensation (PLFCC) technique for a continuous conduction mode boost power factor correction to improve PF in high line voltage and light load conditions. The proposed technique provides a corrected average inductor current reference and utilizes an enhanced duty ratio feed-forward technique which can cancel the adverse effect of the phase leading currents caused by filter capacitors. Moreover. the proposed PLFCC technique also provides the switching dead-zone in nature so the switching loss can be reduced. Therefore. the proposed PLFCC can significantly improve power quality and can achieve a high efficiency in high line voltage and light load conditions. The principle and analysis of the proposed PLFCC are presented. and performance and feasibility are verified by experimental results from the universal input (90-260 V-AC) and 750 W-400 V output laboratory prototype....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control

An average power method is adopted in this paper for determining the fundamental current at the source side. which can readily be implemented without complex calculation. frame transformation. and extra filter. In the design and implementation. the inductances corresponding to various inductor currents were estimated at the startup and stored in the microcontroller for scheduling loop gain cycle by cycle. which can ensure the system stability.

3,There has been a growing demand of using multi-function inverters for grid-connected systems applied to nonconventional energy sources. such as solar. wind and so on. In addition to power quality conditioning. the inverter can also be used for bidirectional active power exchange with a three-phase four-wire grid. Therefore. the inverter acts as a multi-function compensator. The functions of the proposed inverter system include active power injection. rectification and active power filtering (APF) (including phase power balancing). This paper presents design and implementation of a three-leg split-capacitor shunt multi-function inverter with division-summation (D-Sigma) digital control. The adopted D-Sigma digital control can accommodate filter inductance variation. reducing core size significantly. and its control laws can be derived directly to cancel the variation effects of dc-bus voltage. switching period and filter inductance. An average power method is adopted in this paper for determining fundamental currents at the source side.

4,The activity of lateral habenula (LHb) represents a substrate for the encoding of negative-valenced events. The exposure to aversive stimuli in naive mice is sufficient to trigger a reduction in GABA(B)-mediated signaling in the LHb. This is ultimately instrumental for the hyperactivity of LHb neurons and for the establishment of depressive-like phenotypes. However. the mechanisms responsible for the induction of this aversion-driven plasticity are missing. Using ex-vivo patch-clamp recordings in slices. here we show that exposing mice to a series of inescapable footshocks (FsE) rapidly reduces baclofen-mediated GABA(B) currents in the LHb. This plasticity of GABA(B) signaling requires the activation of the dopamine and stress pathways. Indeed. the systemic administration of dopamine and glucocorticoids receptor antagonists prevents the FsE-induced reduction of GABA(B) currents in the LHb. To test whether the recruitment of these receptors occurs within the LHb. we exposed slices from control mice to either dopamine or corticosterone. Both manipulations failed to alter the amplitudes of baclofen-mediated GABA(B) currents. Altogether. these data suggest that dopamine and stress signaling are necessary for the induction of FsE-evoked GABA(B) plasticity in the LHb. However. the activation of these specific receptors may occur in structures different than the LHb. suggesting a circuit-based mechanism for this form of plasticity. These findings provide mechanistic insights on aversion-driven plasticity within the LHb....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Depression
5,Previous observational research suggests that stretching is contagious in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus). Here we report the first experimental evidence of this response through a reanalysis of a previous experiment testing for contagious yawning in this species. Using a repeated measures design. 16 birds were tested as pairs alongside familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics with and without visual barriers. Our results show that stretching behavior was temporally clustered only when the birds could see one another. corroborating previous observational findings supporting contagion. Additionally. for the first time. we show an ingroup bias in this response. That is. while the overall frequency of stretching did not significantly differ as a function of conspecific familiarity. contagious stretching was only present when cage mates were paired together. These findings are discussed in relation to recent research studying social cognition in this species....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Nonverbal communication
6,Background: We developed a new oligonucleotide microarray comprising 16 identical subarrays for simultaneous rapid detection of avian viruses: avian influenza virus (AIV). Newcastle disease virus (NDV). infection bronchitis virus (IBV). and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) in single-and mixed-virus infections. The objective of the study was to develop an oligonucleotide microarray for rapid diagnosis of avian diseases that would be used in the course of mass analysis for routine epidemiological surveillance owing to its ability to test one specimen for several infections. Methods and results: The paper describes the technique for rapid and simultaneous diagnosis of avian diseases such as avian influenza. Newcastle disease. infectious bronchitis and infectious bursal disease with use of oligonucleotide microarray. conditions for hybridization of fluorescent-labelled viral cDNA on the microarray and its specificity tested with use of AIV. NDV. IBV. IBDV strains as well as biomaterials from poultry. Sensitivity and specificity of the developed microarray was evaluated with use of 122 specimens of biological material: 44 cloacal swabs from sick birds and 78 tissue specimens from dead wild and domestic birds. as well as with use of 15 AIV. NDV. IBV and IBDV strains. different in their origin. epidemiological and biological characteristics (RIBSP Microbial Collection). This microarray demonstrates high diagnostic sensitivity (99.16% within 95% CI limits 97.36-100%) and specificity (100%). Specificity of the developed technique was confirmed by direct sequencing of NP and M (AIV). VP2 (IBDV). S1 (IBV). NP (NDV) gene fragments. Conclusion: Diagnostic effectiveness of the developed DNA microarray is 99.18% and therefore it can be used in mass survey for specific detection of AIV. NDV. IBV and IBDV circulating in the region in the course of epidemiological surveillance.

7,BackgroundIn Bangladesh. nomadic duck flocks are groups of domestic ducks reared for egg production that are moved to access feeding sites beyond their owners' village boundaries and are housed overnight in portable enclosures in scavenging areas. The objectives of this study were to measure the prevalence of influenza A virus RNA and H5-specific antibodies in nomadic ducks and to characterize nomadic duck raising practices in northeastern Bangladesh. MethodsWe tested duck egg yolk specimens by competitive ELISA to detect antibodies against avian influenza A (H5) and environmental fecal samples by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect influenza A virus RNA and H5 subtype. ResultsThe median age of the ducks was 24months (range: 8-36months) and the median flock size was 300 ducks (range: 105-1100). Of 1860 egg yolk samples. 556 (30%. 95% confidence interval (CI): 28-32) were positive for antibodies against H5 and 58 flocks (94%) had at least one egg with H5-specific antibodies. Of 496 fecal samples. 121 (24%. 95% CI: 22-29) had detectable influenza A RNA. Thirty-three flocks (53%) had at least one fecal sample positive for influenza A RNA. ConclusionsNomadic ducks in Bangladesh are commonly infected with avian influenza A (H5) virus and may serve as a bridging host for transmission of avian influenza A (H5) virus or other avian influenza A viruses subtypes between wild waterfowl. backyard poultry. and humans in Bangladesh....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,HIV/AIDS
8,Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) are native to Argentina. Chile and the Falkland Islands. Magellanic penguins are highly susceptible to blood parasites such as the mosquito-borne Plasmodium spp.. which have been documented causing high morbidity and mortality in zoos and rehabilitation centres. However. to date no blood parasites have been detected in wild Magellanic penguins. and it is not clear whether this is reflective of their true absence or is instead related to an insufficiency in sampling effort or a failure of the diagnostic methods. We examined blood smears of 284 Magellanic penguins from the Argentinean coast and tested their blood samples with nested polymerase chain reaction tests targeting Haemoproteus. Plasmodium. Leucocytozoon and Babesia. No blood parasites were detected. Analysing the sampling effort of previous studies and the climatogeography of the region. we found there is strong basis to conclude that haemosporidians do not infect wild Magellanic penguins on the Argentinean coast. However. at present it is not possible to determine whether such parasites occur on the Chilean coast and at the Falkland Islands. Furthermore. it is troubling that the northward distribution expansion of Magellanic penguins and the poleward distribution shift of vectors may lead to novel opportunities for the transmission of blood parasites....,biochemistry,MAE,Polymerase chain reaction,Hydraulics
9,Problem. - Neurobiology. adorned with the most recent discoveries of the molecular biology. the genetics and the cognitive sciences. is present everywhere: In the report of the man with his body. with his intellectual faculties. with his perception of others and himself. Our social conducts. morality and our affects would be governed by neuronal substrata. Are things so simple? Methodology. - To try to answer this question. the author is going to use the opposition "to explain" and "understand". in a long-standing and often passionate debate which concerns the epistemology and the ontology. two modalities to be inflexible. Different thus of methods: In the mind of Dilthey. we explain the nature (submitted to the principle of the causality) but we understand the psychic life (which sends back to the sphere of the sense). Results. - If the debate to explain and understand is further and far from being simple. the author adduces to draw from it some conclusions by questioning the speech of the promising of a reductionist neurobiology which believe to explain everything including all our actions in the name of the neurobiological reason: (1) if this is the case. we would be slaves of a history which already has its fate: The neurobiological-shaped man is neurobiological. (2) this speech is based on the mechanism of the tautology. that is it goes round in circles. teaches us absolutely nothing. (3) if the same neurobiologist asserts the opposite. why while reporting me what I say. I have no precise and localizable perception of my consciousness? (4) if the consciousness has no appropriate place or. to say it differently. if there is no intellectual topic appropriate to the consciousness. then what takes place in me will remain forever untranslatable and will be condemned to the silence. To go out of one. exist thus. I need the immediate and permanent help of an other one (or of contradiction). (5) if this process is purely an event of the brain then all our actions. all our gestures. in brief all that it is allowed us to live has to take place as it takes place. (6) finally to assert it brings us nothing more because the explanation always leaves something aside: the phenomenon of the life in which he is imperceptible. The example of the alcoholic is significant: if a change of the intellectual mechanisms is responsible of his alcohol addiction. why the alcoholic. by wanting to drink "how everybody". makes as if written history beforehand was of not much importance? If the alcoholic began thinking of his own cerebral dysfunction while he lives. his life would have no shape. Indeed. if he receives the message and knows the felling about which it is a question. Indeed. if he receives the message and knows the feeling about which it is a question. he cannot. by force of circumstance. feel what his brain passes on to him: he does not witness what appears in its brain. On the other and he witnesses the world in which he lives but also on his condition of mortal. So. without objects to be cultivated. that is without the world of the presence which is the one of the existence and not the understanding. the neurobiological explanation of his alcohol addiction will concern a knowledge but will ignore any life. It means that there is well a gap to live and theorize and that the alcoholic is not reduced to a cerebral dysfunction: he is in the life of relation. that is it is capable of taking up himself by using its real-life experience. The psychopathology implications are going to show themselves here of a very big importance: any reduction comes to truncate the understanding of the man sick coach in reality we constantly have to deal with the "global and complete" man. with the anthropology of the human fate. Conclusion. - If the science brings us news discovered in this domain. it has to keep always in mind that the life remains imperceptible and deeply moving. Without this existential event which allows us "to live". the air will become unbreathable in our more and more technical-scientific world: it would like being sentenced to asphyxiation.

10,In recent years. transportation electrification has emerged as a trend to support energy efficiency and CO2 emissions reduction targets. The true success. however. of this trend depends on the successful integration of electric transportation modes into the infrastructure systems that support them. Left unmanaged. plug-in electric vehicles may suffer from delays due to charging or cause destabilizing charging loads on the electrical grid. Online electric vehicles have emerged to remediate the need for stationary charging and its effects. While many works have sought to mitigate these effects with advanced control functionality. such as coordinated charging. vehicle-to-grid stabilization. and charging queue management. few works have assessed these impacts as a holistic transportation-electricity nexus. This paper develops a hybrid dynamic system model for transportation electrification. It also includes next generation traffic simulation concepts of multimodality and multiagency. Such a model can be used by electrified transportation fleet operators to not just assess but also improve their operations and control. The hybrid dynamic system model is composed of a marked Petri-net model superimposed on the continuous time kinematic and electrical state evolution. The model is demonstrated on an illustrative example of moderate size and functional heterogeneity....,ECE,MAE,Electricity,Fluid mechanics
11,Aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) has attained intensive attention as being a very good transparent conducting oxide for photovoltaic applications. In this work. AZO films have been deposited on glass substrate by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The influences of substrate temperatures on morphological. structural. optical and electrical properties of AZO films were systematically investigated. The results indicate that all AZO films have the hexagonal structure with c-axis preferred orientation. Morphological and electrical measurements have revealed that the substrate temperatures have strong influence on the microstructure. optical and electrical properties of AZO films. The AZO film is highly transparent from ultraviolet up to near infrared range with highest average transparency exceeding 83%. The minimum resistivity is as low as 6.1 x 10(-4) Omega cm. The carrier concentration and mobility are as high as 3.357 x 10(20) cm(-3) and 30.48 cm(2)/Vs. respectively.

12,The present study examines the molecular mechanism underlying in vitro-induced resistance to FLC (fluconazole). KTC (ketaonazole). MCZ (miconazole) and CHX (cycloheximide) in AS (azole-susceptible) strains of Candicia albicans when exposed to CaCDR1/CaCDR2 inducers like FPZ (fluphenazine) and steroids [PRG (progesterone) and beta-EST (beta-oestradiol)]. By employing spot and checkerboard titre assays. we provide evidence of an in vitro-induced antagonism between tested drugs and inducers. which was accompanied with a concomitant increase in CaCDR1 and CaCDR2 transcript levels. Notably. unlike AS isolates. parental WT (wild-type) and Delta cdr2 null strains. Delta cdrl as well as Delta cdr1/Delta cdr2 nulls. when challenged with the inducers could not display antagonism. Our results validated by Northern blotting. reporter gene transcription and TRO (transcription run on) assays show that in vitro-induced antagonism between tested drugs and inducer in AS isolates was mainly due to a transient and reversible transcriptional activation of CaCDR1. Notwithstanding our earlier observation that consistent high transcript levels of CaCDR1 in clinical AR (azole-resistant) isolates were maintained due to the combination of its transcriptional activation and enhanced mRNA stability via elongated poly(A) tails. this study shows that transient and reversible transcriptional activation of CaCDR1 was the major determinant of induced antagonism in AS isolates. The distinct strategies between sustained (in AR isolates) and transiently induced resistance mechanisms (in AS isolates) adopted by Candida should become useful in improving therapeutic approaches....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Fungal Infection
13,Testicular maturation arrest is characterized by interruption of germ cell development and differentiation. Genetic factors play important role in the causation of human disease. including male infertility. The objective was to study copy number variations in testicular maturation arrest using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray technique. Conventional cytogenetics. targeted fluorescence insitu hybridization (FISH) and sequence-tagged site (STS) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to confirm some of the SNP microarray findings. SNP microarray on 68 cases of testicular maturation arrest detected copy number variations (CNVs) mostly on sex chromosomes involving pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) 1. 2 and 3 as well as azoospermic factors (AZFs) besides three cases of chromosomal abnormalities (two Klinefelter syndromes and one case of dicentric Y). The AZF deletion was observed in 14 (20.6%) cases and the AZFc gain was observed in 6 (8.8%) cases. PAR 1 and 2 CNVs was observed in 5 (7.3%) cases. PAR 3 CNVs was detected in 19 cases and 2 controls. The TSPY2 gene gain (within PAR 3 CNVs) was observed in 16 cases and 1 control. CNV containing autosomal genes possibly associated with male infertility in this study was SPATA31A2-A5 (9p12) in five cases. In this study. SNP microarray identified possible underlying aetiology in 55.9% (38/68) cases besides identifying minimal critical region of AZFc deletion as 0.51mb (Y:24356128-24873665) involving TTY5. RBMY2FP. RBMY1F. RBMY1J. TTY6 and PRY genes. SNP microarray seems superior. sensitive. specific as well as cost-effective method and has potential to be the first tier investigations to explore underlying genomic factors of testicular maturation arrest. The present study is an attempt to find out probable genomic factors with idiopathic testicular maturation arrest....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Low Testosterone
14,Properly regulated immunity requires precise integration of activating and inhibitory signals. As for other lymphocytes. B cells express an antigen-specific activating receptor. the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR). and inhibitory receptors (e.g. Fc gamma RIIb) that exercise checkpoint control on B-cell activation. Moreover. following BCR engagement. CD19 recruits proteins that amplify BCR signaling. while CD22 initiates a negative feedback loop by recruiting proteins that inhibit BCR signaling. Initial BCR signaling is mediated by protein tyrosine kinases and lipid kinases; inhibitory receptors directly antagonize the actions of these enzymes by recruiting protein tyrosine phosphatases and lipid phosphatases and positioning them close to actively signaling BCRs. Previously it was thought that inhibitory receptors such as Fc gamma RIIb and CD22 were essential for bringing these phosphatases near the BCR. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology. Manno et al. show that a tripartite inhibitory module consisting of the adaptor proteins Dok-3 and Grb2 and the lipid phosphatase SHIP1 binds directly to activated BCRs and limits the Ca2+ mobilization that is required for B lymphocyte activation. This reveals that the BCR can be both an activating and inhibitory receptor. one that activates signaling enzymes while initiating a negative feedback loop that prevents excessive signaling....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Lymphoma
15,Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a highly contagious viral disease. Antibodies are pivotal in providing protection against FMDV infection. Serological protection against one FMDV serotype does not confer interserotype protection. However. some historical data have shown that interserotype protection can be induced following sequential FMDV challenge with multiple FMDV serotypes. In this study. we have investigated the kinetics of the FMDV-specific antibody-secreting cell (ASC) response following homologous and heterologous inactivated FMDV vaccination regimes. We have demonstrated that the kinetics of the B cell response are similar for all four FMDV serotypes tested following a homologous FMDV vaccination regime. When a heterologous vaccination regime was used with the sequential inoculation of three different inactivated FMDV serotypes (O. A. and Asia1 serotypes) a B cell response to FMDV SAT1 and serotype C was induced. The studies also revealed that the local lymphoid tissue had detectable FMDV-specific ASCs in the absence of circulating FMDV-specific ASCs. indicating the presence of short-lived ASCs. a hallmark of a T-independent 2 (TI-2) antigenic response to inactivated FMDV capsid. IMPORTANCE We have demonstrated the development of intraserotype response following a sequential vaccination regime of four different FMDV serotypes. We have found indication of short-lived ASCs in the local lymphoid tissue. further evidence of a TI-2 response to FMDV....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,HIV/AIDS
16,Chronic inflammation in the tumor microenvironment and evasion of the antitumor effector immune response are two of the emerging hallmarks required for oncogenesis and cancer progression. The innate immune system not only plays a critical role in perpetuating these tumor-promoting hallmarks but also in developing antitumor adaptive immune responses. Thus. understanding the dual role of the innate system in cancer immunology is required for the design of combined immunotherapy strategies able to tackle established tumors. Here. we review recent advances in the understanding of the role of cell populations and soluble components of the innate immune system in cancer. with a focus on complement. the adapter molecule Stimulator of Interferon Genes. natural killer cells. myeloid cells. and B cells....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Cancer
17,Around 65% of primary immunodeficiencies are antibody deficiencies. Functional tests are useful tools to study B-cell functions in vitro. However. no accepted guidelines for performing and evaluating functional tests have been issued yet. Here. we report our experience on the study of B-cell functions in infancy and throughout childhood. We show that T-independent stimulation with CpGmeasures proliferation and differentiation potential of memory B cells. Switched memory B cells respond better than IgM memory B cells. On the other hand. CD40L. a T-dependent stimulus. does not induce plasma cell differentiation. but causes proliferation of naive and memory B cells. During childhood. the production of plasmablasts in response to CpG increases with age mirroring the development of memory B cells. The response to CD40L does not change with age. In patients with selective IgA deficiency (SIgAD). we observed that switched memory B cells are reduced due to the absence of IgA memory B cells. In agreement. IgA plasma cells are not generated in response to CpG. Unexpectedly. B cells from SIgAD patients show a reduced proliferative response to CD40L. Our results demonstrate that functional tests are an important tool to assess the functions of the humoral immune system....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Lymphoma
18,Osteopontin (OPN) is a protein. generally considered to play a pro-tumorigenic role. whereas several reports have demonstrated the anti-tumorigenic function of OPN during tumor development. These opposing anti-and pro-tumorigenic functions are not fully understood. Here. we report that host-derived OPN plays an anti-tumorigenic role in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model and a TRAMP tumor transplant model. Tumor suppression mediated by OPN in Rag2(-/-) mice suggests that OPN is dispensable in the adaptive immune response. We found that host-derived OPN enhanced infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells into TRAMP tumors. The requirement of OPN in NK cell migration towards TRAMP cells was confirmed by an ex vivo cell migration assay. In contrast to TRAMP cells. in vivo B16 tumor development was not inhibited by OPN. and B16 tumors did not show OPN-mediated cell recruitment. It is possible that low levels of chemokine expression by B16 cells do not allow OPN to enhance immune cell recruitment. In addition to demonstrating the anti-tumorigenic role of OPN in TRAMP tumor development. this study also suggests that the contribution of OPN to tumor development depends on the type of tumor as well as the source and isoform of OPN....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Cancer
19,Design and implementation of a low cost grid-connected 5kVA solar photovoltaic (PV) system is proposed in this paper. Since the inverter is a major component of the PV system. the B4 inverter used in this paper reduces the total cost of the PV system. In order to eliminate the massive transformer. the PV system is connected to the grid through IGBT switches. In addition to injection of active power into the grid. the B4 inverter can compensate reactive power and reduce harmonics of the nonlinear loads. A TMS320F28335 DSP processor is used for effective control of the B4 inverter. Various features of this processor enable the implementation of the necessary control algorithms. As a first step. the PV system is simulated and evaluated in Matlab/Simulink. In the second step. hardware circuits are designed and implemented based on the simulation results. The operation of the PV system has been evaluated under balanced. unbalanced. linear and nonlinear loads which proves its accuracy and efficiency....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Electrical generator
20,B7-homolog 4 (B7-H4). one of the costimulatory molecules of the B7 family. has been reported to be widely expressed in multiple types of cancer tissues. and to be important in tumor progression and poor prognosis. However. the role of B7-H4 in esophageal precancerous lesions has not been elucidated yet. In the present study. a model of esophageal squamous cell carcinogenesis was established in 208 C57BL/6 mice by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) drinking water of mice. and the changes in the expression of B7-H4 during the whole pathological process were investigated. Hematoxylin and eosin staining results demonstrated that the pathological stage was exacerbated with the increase in time of 4NQO-mediated carcinogenesis induction. and the pathological features were similar to those observed in humans. Immunohistochemistry results revealed that B7-H4 expression was upregulated and positively correlated with pathological stage (P < 0.0001) as well as with infiltration of cluster of differentiation (CD) 11b(+) macrophage cells (P=0.0002). In addition. B7-H4 messenger RNA expression increased in the esophagi of model mice compared with that of control mice. which was positively associated with the gene expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). according to the results of reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Similarly. B7-H4 protein expression was upregulated in the esophageal tissues of model mice in comparison with that of control mice. and was positively associated with IL-6 expression and STAT3 phosphorylation. In conclusion. the present data suggested that B7-H4 expression increased during esophageal squamous cell carcinogenesis in mice in association with IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway activation....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
21,Background: Babesiosis is a socioeconomically important tick- borne disease of animals (including humans) caused by haemoprotozoan parasites. The severity of babesiosis relates to host and parasite factors. particularly virulence/pathogenicity. Although Babesia bovis is a particularly pathogenic species of cattle. there are species of Babesia of ruminants that have limited pathogenicity. For instance. the operational taxonomic unit Babesia sp. Xinjiang (abbreviated here as Bx) of sheep from China is substantially less virulent/pathogenic than B. bovis is in cattle. Although the reason for this distinctiveness is presently unknown. it is possible that Bx has a reduced ability to adhere to cells or evade/suppress immune responses. which might relate to particular proteins. such as the variant erythrocyte surface antigens (VESAs). Results: We sequenced and annotated the 8.4 Mb nuclear draft genome of Bx and compared it with those of B. bovis and B. bigemina by synteny analysis; we also investigated the genetic relationship of Bx with selected Babesia species and related apicomplexans for which genomic datasets are available. and explored the VESA complement in Bx. Conclusions: The availability of the Bx genome now provides unique opportunities to elucidate aspects of the molecular biology. biochemistry and physiology of Bx. and to explore the reason(s) for its limited virulence and/or apparent ability to evade immune attack by the host animal. Moreover. the present genomic resource and an in vitro culture system for Bx raises the prospect of establishing a functional genomic platform to explore essential genes as new intervention targets against babesiosis....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Alzheimer's Disease
22,The apicoplast (ap) is a unique. non-photosynthetic organelle found in most apicomplexan parasites. Due to the essential roles that this organelle has. it has been widely considered as target for drugs against diseases caused by apicomplexans. Exploring the ap genomes of such parasites would provide a better understanding of their systematics and their basic molecular biology for therapeutics. However. there is limited information available on the ap genomes of apicomplexan parasites. In the present study. the ap genomes of two operational taxonomic units of Babesia (known as Babesia sp. Lintan [Bl] and Babesia sp. Xinjiang [Bx]) from sheep were sequenced. assembled and annotated using a massive parallel sequencing based approach. Then. the gene content and gene order in these ap genomes (similar to 30.7 kb in size) were defined and compared. and the genetic differences were assessed. In addition. a phylogenetic analysis of ap genomic data sets was carried out to assess the relationships of these taxonomic units with other apicomplexan parasites for which complete ap genomic data sets were publicly available. The results showed that the ap genomes of Bl and Bx encode 59 and 57 genes. respectively. including 2 ribosomal RNA genes. 25 transfer RNA genes and 30-32 protein-encoding genes. being similar in content to those of Babesia bovis and B. orientalis. Ap gene regions that might serve as markers for future epidemiological and population genetic studies of Babesia species were identified. Using sequence data for a subset of six protein-encoding genes. a close relationship of Bl and Bx with Babesia bovis from cattle and B. orientalis from water buffalo was inferred. Although the focus of the present study was on Babesia. we propose that the present sequencing-bioinformatic approach should be applicable to organellar genomes of a wide range of apicomplexans of veterinary importance.

23,Baby factories are new systematic abuse structures that are promoting infant trafficking. neo-slavery and the exploitation of young women with unwanted pregnancies in Nigeria. Since this practice was first described in 2006. it has been growing rather than abating. This paper reviews the scientific literature. along with media reports. and critiques this phenomenon from a children's rights' perspective. Children born into baby factories are denied various civil rights. They also suffer abuse in the baby factories and as a consequence of being born in such places. This abuse can be classified into immediate and long term. Immediate abuse includes inadequate care and its repercussions. denial of birth registration. illegal adoption and murder. Long-term or delayed abuse that they may be exposed to includes health-related consequences. neglect. death. child labour. prostitution and other sexual abuse. organ trafficking and recruitment as child soldiers. Various factors are thought to drive the baby factory phenomenon which include poverty. high infertility rates and the profitability of local and inter-country adoptions. Programmes directed at addressing the root cause of the problem are needed in order to eliminate infant trafficking. Also. clear laws that delineate inter-country adoption and infant trafficking need to be enacted. Most importantly. baby factories need to be recognised as child trafficking routes.

24,Baby factories and baby harvesting are relatively new terms that involve breeding. trafficking. and abuse of infants and their biological mothers. Since it was first described in a United Nations Educational. Scientific and Cultural Organization report in Nigeria in 2006. several more baby factories have been discovered over the years. Infertile women are noted to be major patrons of these baby factories due to the stigmatization of childless couples in Southern Nigeria and issues around cultural acceptability of surrogacy and adoption. These practices have contributed to the growth in the industry which results in physical. psychological. and sexual violence to the victims. Tackling baby factories will involve a multifaceted approach that includes advocacy and enacting of legislation barring baby factories and infant trafficking and harsh consequences for their patrons. Also. programs to educate young girls on preventing unwanted pregnancies are needed. Methods of improving awareness and acceptability of adoption and surrogacy and reducing the administrative and legal bottlenecks associated with these options for infertile couples should be explored to diminish the importance of baby factories....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Parenting
25,Clostridium haemolyticum causes bacillary hemoglobinuria (BH). an infectious and usually fatal disease that occurs mostly in cattle. which is clinically characterized by jaundice. hemoglobinuria. and anemia. The trematode Fasciola hepatica has been commonly reported as the main predisposing factor that triggers this condition. The authors evaluated 20 naturally occurring cases of bovine BH to characterize the pathology and pathogenesis of the disease. Grossly. the most consistent finding was a large. frequently single focus of necrosis surrounded by a red to purple halo. observed most frequently on the parietal surface of the right and left hepatic lobes. Other findings were jaundice. dark-brown discoloration of kidneys. and red urine in the urinary bladder. Microscopically. characteristic lesions were locally extensive. necrotizing hepatitis with thrombosis and numerous intralesional Gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria. and acute renal tubular necrosis. By immunohistochemistry. many hepatocytes outside the necrotic focus in the liver were positive for activated caspase 3. suggesting that those cells were undergoing apoptosis. Ultrastructural evaluation revealed hepatocyte necrosis. hemolysis. and clumps of vegetative and sporulating bacilli within the liver. Polymerase chain reaction for the C. haemolyticum beta toxin gene was positive in randomly selected liver samples. No gross or microscopic lesions indicative of fascioliasis were detected in the liver of any animal. suggesting that other yet undetermined predisposing factors were associated with these cases of BH....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Hepatitis C
26,Deeper understanding of plant-endophyte interactions under abiotic stress would provide new insights into phytoprotection and phytoremediation enhancement. Many studies have investigated the positive role of plant-endophyte interactions in providing protection to the plant against pollutant stress through auxin (indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)) production. However. little is known about the impact of endophytic colonization patterns on plant stress response in relation to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IAA levels. Moreover. the possible effect of pollutant phase on plant stress response is poorly understood. Here. we elucidated the impact of endophytic colonization patterns on plant stress response under airborne formaldehyde compared to formaldehyde-contaminated soil. ROS. tryptophan and IAA levels in the roots and shoots of endophyte-inoculated and non-inoculated plants in the presence and absence of formaldehyde were measured. Strain-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to investigate dynamics of endophyte colonization. Under the initial exposure to airborne formaldehyde. non-inoculated plants accumulated more tryptophan in the shoots (compared to the roots) to synthesize IAA. However. endophyte-inoculated plants behaved differently as they synthesized and accumulated more tryptophan in the roots and. hence. higher levels of IM accumulation and exudation within roots which might act as a signaling molecule to selectively recruit B. cereus ERBP. Under continuous airborne formaldehyde stress. higher levels of ROS accumulation in the shoots pushed the plant to synthesize more tryptophan and IAA in the shoots (compared to the roots). Higher levels of IAA in the shoots might act as the potent driving force to relocalize B. cereus ERBP from roots to the shoots. In contrast. under formaldehyde-contaminated soil. B. cereus ERBP colonized root tissues without moving to the shoots since there was a sharp increase in ROS. tryptophan and IAA levels of the roots without any significant increase in the shoots. Pollutant phase affected endophytic colonization patterns and plant stress responses differently. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

27,To isolate and identify DNA-binding protein(s) with affinity for the mobile chromosomal repeat element bcr1 in Bacillus cereus group bacteria. A biotinylated bcr1 element was immobilized to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and used to pull out a 20 kDa DNA-binding protein from a whole cell protein extract of B. cereus ATCC 14579. The protein was identified as the product of ORF 2 encoded by the bacteriophage-related autonomously replicating linear genetic element pBClin15 carried by the strain. DNA binding was not bcr1-specific. By Northern blotting ORF 2 was co-transcribed with ORF 1. and also in certain instances with ORF 3 by transcriptional readthrough of the terminator located between ORF 2 and ORF 3. ORF 2 from pBClin15 encodes a DNA-binding protein. ORF 2 is co-transcribed with its upstream gene ORF 1. and in a subset of the transcripts also with the downstream gene ORF 3 through alternative transcription termination. The B. cereus group contains bacterial species of medical and economic importance. Bacteriophages or phage-encoded proteins from these bacteria have been suggested as potential therapeutic agents. Understanding the biology of bacteriophage-related genetic elements through functional characterization of their genes is of high relevance....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
28,Effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on cell growth and poly(-glutamic acid) (-PGA) synthesis were studied by adding hydrogen peroxide to a medium of Bacillus subtilis NX-2. After optimizing the addition concentration and time of H2O2. a maximum concentration of 33.9g/L -PGA was obtained by adding 100 mu M H2O2 to the medium after 24H. This concentration was 20.6% higher than that of the control. The addition of diphenyleneiodonium chloride (ROS inhibitor) can interdict the effect of H2O2-induced ROS. Transcriptional levels of the cofactors and relevant genes were also determined under ROS stress to illustrate the possible metabolic mechanism contributing to the improve -PGA production. The transcriptional levels of genes belonging to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transfer chain system were significantly increased by ROS. which decreased the NADH/NAD(+) ratio and increased the ATP levels. thereby providing more reducing power and energy for -PGA biosynthesis. The enhanced -PGA synthetic genes also directly promoted the formation of -PGA. This study was the first to use the ROS control strategy for -PGA fermentation and provided valuable information on the possible mechanism by which ROS regulated -PGA biosynthesis in B. subtilis NX-2.

29,Many food and feed additives result from fermentation of genetically modified (GM) microorganisms. For vitamin B2 (riboflavin). GM Bacillus subtilis production strains have been developed and are often used. The presence of neither the GM strain nor its recombinant DNA is allowed for fermentation products placed on the EU market as food or feed additive. A vitamin B2 product (80% feed grade) imported from China was analysed. Viable B. subtilis cells were identified and DNAs of two bacterial isolates (LHL and LGL) were subjected to three whole genome sequencing (WGS) runs with different devices (MiSeq. 454 or HiSeq system). WGS data revealed the integration of a chloramphenicol resistance gene. the deletion of the endogenous riboflavin (rib) operon and presence of four putative plasmids harbouring rib operons. Event- and construct-specific real-time PCR methods for detection of the GM strain and its putative plasmids in food and feed products have been developed. (C) 2017 The Authors.

30,To explore the influence of the direct repeat sequence (DRS) in Bacillus chitinase genes on heterogonous expression in Escherichia coli. we cloned and sequenced the entire open reading frame (ORF) and upstream sequences of the chitinase B (chiB) and chitinase MY75 (chiMY75) from Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus licheniformis. A pair of 8-bp DRS was found upstream of each chi gene. Chi ORFs with a series of truncated DRS were cloned and transformed into E. coli XL-Blue. The activity of the transformants without the DRS were significantly higher in chitinase assays than transformants containing the DRS. SOS-PAGE showed that part and full deletion of the DRS increased chi gene expression by approximately 1.7 and 3.8-fold. respectively. Northern blotting revealed deletion of the DRS regions increased chiB and chiMY75 mRNA expression. Specific binding of DNA-binding factors in the E. coli cell lyaste was observed to both the chiB and chiMY75 promoter regions and DRS elements. This is the first investigation to demonstrate that heterologous expression of Bacillus chi genes in E. coli is negatively regulated by their upstream DRS regions. which act as cis-acting elements.

31,In recent years. model predictive control (MPC) has been successfully used for the control of power electronics converters with different topologies and for different applications. MPC offers many advantages over more traditional control techniques such as the ability to avoid cascaded control loops. easy inclusion of constraint. and fast transient response. On the other hand. the controller computational burden increases exponentially with the system complexity and may result in an unfeasible realization on modern digital control boards. This paper proposes a novel distributed MPC (DMPC). which is able to achieve the same performance of the classical MPC while reducing the computational requirements of its implementation. The proposed control approach is tested on a ac/ac converter in a back-to-back configuration used for power flow management. Simulation results are provided and validated through experimental testing in several operating conditions....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Control engineering
32,This work presents a fully FPGA based deadbeat-like predictive control scheme for back-to-back converter PMSG wind turbine systems with space vector modulator (SVM). A deadbeat-like predictive torque/current controller is used to control the machine side converter. while a deadbeat power control method in alpha beta frame is used to control the grid side converter. Both sides achieve nice steady state performances requiring few tuning efforts. Both the machine and grid side predictive controllers are realized on a commercial-off-the-shelf FPGA based platform. By using a single-cycle-timed-loop (SCTL) technique. the whole computation time is quite short (less than 4 mu s). which makes the calculation time compensation not required. The effectiveness of the presented method is verified through experimental data....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
33,The use of power converters has considerably grown up. in part. because refined control strategies have been recently proposed. including nonlinear schemes such as predictive control. This approach is used in this work considering a variable grid frequency environment in order to get an appropriate response for a wide ac mains frequency range. Indeed. in order to achieve appropriate. both dynamic and static. responses for all operating frequencies. the number of samples per period is kept constant and independent of the ac mains frequency. This allows a fixed resolution of the sensed voltages and/or currents. which is preferable if high-performance digital control schemes are required. However. imposing a constant number of samples per period requires a variable sampling time in systems that feature variable ac mains frequency. On the other hand. predictive control has been developed and well documented just for a constant sampling frequency. This work presents how to extend the predictive control algorithms for variable sampling time allowing high-performance waveforms and wider ac mains frequency range. Simulated and experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed control strategy which corroborates the mathematical and model analysis....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Control engineering
34,This paper presents a three-phase back-to-back transformerless inverter for online uninterruptible power supply applications. The inverter consists of a three-phase three-wire input rectifier stage and a three-phase four-wire output inverter stage with their ground wires tied together. Both of the two stages are with sinusoidal pulse width modulation based division-summation (D-Sigma) digital control. The input stage controls the power flow between utility grid and dc link. regulates the dc-link voltage. and fulfills power factor correction. While the output stage tracks three-phase ac reference voltages. The proposed control laws derived based on the D-Sigma digital approach take into account the effects of dc-link voltage fluctuation. grid-voltage distortion. and inductance variation due to different current levels. Thus. distortion of input current and output voltage. and filter inductor core size can be reduced significantly. Moreover. circulating current through their common ground can be suppressed effectively. Simulated and experimental results from a three-phase back-to-back transformerless inverter have confirmed the analysis and discussion of the proposed control approach....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
35,The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of Toxoplasma gondii in backyard pigs destined for human consumption in Pernambuco state. Brazil. Blood and tissue samples (liver. heart. brain. lung and diaphragm) were collected from 224 pigs from legal slaughterhouses and tested for T. gondii infection. Antibodies to T. gondii were found in the sera of 37.9% (85/224) by using the immunofluorescence antibody test (cut-off -1: 64). Tissue samples from seropositive pigs were bioassayed in mice. Tissue samples from seropositive pigs and from mice of the bioassay were submitted to histopathology. immunohistochemistry. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing; 14.1% of pig tissue samples and 27.7% of bioassayed mouse samples were positive for T. gondii DNA. but all pig and mouse tissues were negative in histopathology analysis and immunochemistry. By using a risk assessment questionnaire. there was significant difference (p< 0.001) in seroprevalence of 21.2% (reproducer) and 3.1% (finishing pig). These data serve as indicative of the sanitary conditions and risk of T. gondii infection for backyard pigs.

36,Waterborne diseases have emerged as global health problems and their rapid and sensitive detection in environmental water samples is of great importance. Bacterial identification and enumeration in water samples is significant as it helps to maintain safe drinking water for public consumption. Culture-based methods are laborious. time-consuming. and yield false-positive results. whereas viable but nonculturable (VBNCs) microorganisms cannot be recovered. Hence. numerous methods have been developed for rapid detection and quantification of waterborne pathogenic bacteria in water. These rapid methods can be classified into nucleic acid-based. immunology-based. and biosensor-based detection methods. This review summarizes the principle and current state of rapid methods for the monitoring and detection of waterborne bacterial pathogens. Rapid methods outlined are polymerase chain reaction (PCR). digital droplet PCR. real-time PCR. multiplex PCR. DNA microarray. Next-generation sequencing (pyrosequencing. Illumina technology and genomics). and fluorescence in situ hybridization that are categorized as nucleic acid-based methods. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence are classified into immunology-based methods.

37,A repetitive sequence-based (rep)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR)-PCR were used to molecular type Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (PSS) strains isolated from barley and wheat plants with bacterial black node symptoms grown in 22 different locations and six different seed-production districts in Japan. Eighteen genomic fingerprinting (GF) genotypes were obtained from the combined results of BOX-. REP-. and GTG(5)-PCR. indicating that the PSS population in Japan has high genetic diversity. The result based on logistic regression indicated that the population of GF genotype A was significantly related to a seed-producing district and that the epidemic of PSS strains in fields originated mainly from seed infection.

A milk replacer was fed to calves from 8days of age. A starter and alfalfa hay was offered ad libitum from 21 and 28days of age. respectively. and the orts were weighted daily. The ruminal fluid was sampled at 56 and 83days of age to determine the rumen fermentation characteristics. The bacterial community was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and the number of certain bacteria was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The ratio of total dry matter intake to average body wieght was higher in the control (P<0.05). The DGGE fingerprint of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was affected by the blended probiotics at 83days of age. The number of Ruminococcus albus was lower in the LB and LBS treatment (P<0.05). Oral administration of the probiotics affected the rumen bacterial community and the numbers of cellulolytic bacteria decreased....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Molecular biology
39,To determine the effect of oxytetracycline on the anaerobic biological treatment of livestock wastewater. we studied the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (determined by K2Cr2O7. CODCr). methane production. and bacterial diversity under the stress of different concentrations of oxytetracycline. Results indicated that the removal of COD and the yield of methane were inhibited by oxytetracycline. With an increase in oxytetracycline concentration. methane production decreased from 392 to 207mL (the control group was 448 mL) and COD removal efficiency fell from 92% to 84% (the control group was 94%). Results of PCRDGGE (polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) indicated that. with an increase in oxytetracycline concentration. the richness values of the bacterial community fell from 0.86 to 0.45 (the control group was 1). In addition. oxytetracycline reduced COD removal efficiency. methane production. and bacterial diversity in livestock wastewater. Results presented in this study provide important information about bacterial diversity in livestock wastewater treated using oxytetracycline....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Human Metabolism
40,Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is an important crop of the Cucurbitaceae family in fruit production worldwide. During its production. bacterial fruit blotch (BFB) caused by Acidovorax citrulli (Acidovorax avenae subsp. citrulli) is an important limiting factor on the volume and value of crops. This pathogen is known as a seed-borne pathogen. and the infested seeds can be a primary source of inoculum. Hence. a rapid and sensitive method for detecting A. citrulli on seeds would be an important tool in the management of BFB. In this study. we sought to develop a method to detect A. citrulli bacterial cells based on a TaqMan probe-based insulated isothermal PCR (TiiPCR) assay. Firstly. the specific primers and probe were designed based on a specific DNA fragment from the genome of A. citrulli. Then. PCR amplification was performed with the plasmid DNA to adjust the components of the PCR reagents. such as the concentrations of primers. magnesium chloride. and Taq DNA polymerase. Results revealed that 10 copies of plasmid DNA were detectable within the modified reagents by TiiPCR. Moreover. 10 bacterial cells in each reaction tube were detectable at a 100 % detection rate in this condition with a fluorescent signal intensification over 1.8. Based on these results. we concluded that a specific. rapid. and sensitive method based on TiiPCR had been successfully developed to detect bacterial cells of A. citrulli....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Polymerase chain reaction
41,The targeting of bacterial type III secretion systems (T3SSs). which are critical virulence factors in most Gram-negative pathogens. is regarded as an alternative strategy for the development of novel anti-microbial drugs. Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) are two of the most important bacterial pathogens on rice. which cause leaf blight and leaf streak diseases. respectively. To identify potential anti-virulence drugs against these two pathogens. we screened a library of plant phenolic compounds and derivatives for their effects on the Xoo T3SS. Ten of 56 compounds significantly inhibited the promoter activity of a harpin gene. hpa1. These inhibitors were further tested for their impact on the hypersensitive response (HR) caused by Xoo on non-host tobacco plants. The results showed that pretreatment of Xoo with TS006 (o-coumaric acid. OCA). TS010. TS015 and TS018 resulted in significantly attenuated HR without affecting bacterial growth or survival. In addition. Cya translocation assays demonstrated that the translocation of two T3 effectors was suppressed by the four inhibitors. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that mRNA levels of representative genes in the hrp (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity) cluster. as well as the regulatory genes hrpG and hrpX. were reduced by treatment with the four inhibitors. suggesting that expression of the Xoo T3SS was suppressed. The expression of other virulence factors was not suppressed. which indicated possible T3SS-specific inhibition. Finally. we demonstrated that these inhibitors reduced the disease symptoms of Xoo and Xoc on the rice cultivar (Oryza sativa) IR24 to varying extents....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Osteoarthritis
42,Objective. -To determine if bacterial vaginosis is a marker for risk of spontaneous preterm delivery and if its detection and treatment can reduce this risk. Methods. -Consultation of the database Pubmed/Medline. Science Direct. and international guidelines of medical societies. Results. -Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a dysbiosis resulting in an imbalance in the vaginal flora through the multiplication of anaerobic bacteria and jointly of a disappearance of well-known protective Lactobacilli. His diagnosis is based on clinical Amsel criteria and/or a Gram stain with establishment of the Nugent score. The prevalence of the BV extraordinarily varies according to ethnic and/or geographical origin (4-58 %). in France. it is close to 7 % in the first trimester of pregnancy (EL2). The link between BV and spontaneous premature delivery is low with an odds ratio between 1.5 and 2 in the most recent studies (EL3). Metronidazole or clindamycin is effective to treat BV (EL3). It is recommended to prescribe one of these antibiotics in the case of symptomatic BV (Professional Consensus). The testing associated with the treatment of BV in the global population showed no benefit in the prevention of the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (EL2). Concerning low-risk asymptomatic population (defined by the absence of antecedent of premature delivery). it has been failed profit to track and treat the BV in the prevention of the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (ELI). Concerning the high-risk population (defined by a history of preterm delivery). it has been failed profit to track and treat the VB in the prevention of the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (EL3). However. in the sub population of patients with a history of preterm delivery occurred in a context of materno-fetal bacterial infection. there may be a benefit to detect and treat early and systematically genital infection. and in particular the BV (Professional Consensus). Conclusion. -The screening and treatment of BV during pregnancy in asymptomatic low-risk population is not recommended in the prevention of the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (grade A): In the population at high risk with the only notion of antecedent of premature delivery. screening and treatment of the BY is not recommended (grade C).

44,The Dutch microbiologist/biochemist Albert Jan Kluyver (1888-1956) was an early proponent of the idea of biochemical unity. and how that concept might be demonstrated through the careful study of microbial life. The fundamental relatedness of living systems is an obvious correlate of the theory of evolution. and modern attempts to construct phylogenetic schemes support this relatedness through comparison of genomes. The approach of Kluyver and his scientific descendants predated the tools of modern molecular biology by decades. Kluyver himself is poorly recognized today. yet his influence at the time was profound. Through lens of today however. it has been argued that the focus by Kluyver and others to create taxonomic and phylogenetic schemes using morphology and biochemistry distorted and hindered progress of the discipline of microbiology. because of a perception that the older approaches focused too much on a reductionist worldview. This essay argues that in contrast the careful characterization of fundamental microbial metabolism and physiology by Kluyver made many of the advances of the latter part of the twentieth century possible. by offering a framework which in many respects anticipated our current view of phylogeny. and by directly and indirectly training a generation of scientists who became leaders in the explosive growth of biotechnology....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Genetics
45,In this article we compare the efficacy of different pharmacological agents ( ranitidine. and omeprazole) to support phage transit from stomach to distal portions of the gastrointestinal tract in rats. We show that a temporal modification of environment in the animal stomach may protect Twort-like therapeutic antistaphylococcal phage A5/80 ( from bacteriophage collection of the Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy PAS in Wroclaw. Poland) from the inactivation by gastric juice effectively enough to enable a significant fraction of orally administered A5/80 to pass to the intestine. Interestingly. we found that yogurt may be a relatively strong in enhancing phage transit. Given the immunomodulating activities of phages our data may suggest that phages and yogurt can act synergistically in mediating their probiotic activities and enhancing the effectiveness of oral phage therapy. We also demonstrate that orally applied phages of similar size. morphology. and sensitivity to acidic environment may differ in their translocation into the bloodstream. This was evident in mice in which a therapeutic staphylococcal phage A5/80 reached the blood upon oral administration combined with antacid agent whilst T4 phage was not detected even when applied in 103 times higher dose. Our findings also suggest that phage penetration from digestive tract to the blood may be species-specific....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Digestive Health
46,The Poisson distribution played a key role in experiments that had a historic role in the development of molecular biology. In particular. the interpretation and design of experiments elucidating the actions of bacteriophages and their host bacteria during the infection process were based on the parameters of the Poisson distribution. I briefly review three of the most important of these experiments and offer suggestions on the use of the Poisson distribution in statistical calculations in biology laboratory exercises reflecting the use of the Poisson distribution in current biological investigations....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Molecular biology
47,His-Asn-His (HNH) proteins are a very common family of small nucleic acid-binding proteins that are generally associated with endonuclease activity and are found in all kingdoms of life. Although HNH endonucleases from mesophiles have been widely investigated. the biochemical functions of HNH endonucleases from thermophilic bacteriophages remain unknown. Here. we characterized the biochemical properties of a thermostable HNH endonuclease from deep-sea thermophilic bacteriophage GVE2. The recombinant GVE2 HNH endonuclease exhibited non-specific cleavage activity at high temperature. The optimal temperature of the GVE2 HNH endonuclease for cleaving DNA was 60-65 A degrees C. and the enzyme retained its DNA cleavage activity even after heating at 100 A degrees C for 30 min. suggesting the enzyme is a thermostable endonuclease. The GVE2 HNH endonuclease cleaved DNA over a wide pH spectrum. ranging from 5.5 to 9.0. and the optimal pH for the enzyme activity was 8.0-9.0. Furthermore. the GVE2 HNH endonuclease activity was dependent on a divalent metal ion. While the enzyme is inactive in the presence of Cu2+. the GVE2 HNH endonuclease displayed cleavage activity of varied efficiency with Mn2+. Mg2+. Ca2+. Fe2+. Co2+. Zn2+. and Ni2+. The GVE2 HNH endonuclease activity was inhibited by NaCl. This study provides the basis for determining the role of this endonuclease in life cycle of the bacteriophage GVE2 and suggests the potential application of the enzyme in molecular biology and biotechnology....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Enzymology
48,Bacteriophages represent a simple viral model of basic research with many possibilities for practical application. Due to their ability to infect and kill bacteria. their potential in the treatment of bacterial infection has been examined since their discovery. With advances in molecular biology and gene engineering. the phage application spectrum has been expanded to various medical and biotechnological fields. The construction of bacteriophages with an extended host range or longer viability in the mammalian bloodstream enhances their potential as an alternative to conventional antibiotic treatment. Insertion of active depolymerase genes to their genomes can enforce the biofilm disposal. They can also be engineered to transfer various compounds to the eukaryotic organisms and the bacterial culture. applicable for the vaccine. drug or gene delivery. Phage recombinant lytic enzymes can be applied as enzybiotics in medicine as well as in biotechnology for pathogen detection or programmed cell death in bacterial expression strains. Besides. modified bacteriophages with high specificity can be applied as bioprobes in detection tools to estimate the presence of pathogens in food industry. or utilized in the control of food-borne pathogens as part of the constructed phage-based biosorbents....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Parkinson's Disease
49,Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) are the major effector cells of mucosal immunity. and immunoglobulin G (IgG) ASCs are also associated with mucosal immunity. This study aimed to explore the distribution of these 2 ASC populations in the palatine tonsils of Bactrian camels of different ages. Eighteen Bactrian camels were divided into the following three age groups: pubertal (3-5 years). middle-aged (6-16 years) and old (17-20 years). SIgA and IgG ASCs within different sites of the palatine tonsils were observed through histological and immunohistochemical techniques. and their densities were analyzed using statistical methods. The results from all age groups showed that both the SIgA and IgG ASCs were primarily distributed in the subepithelial compartments of the reticulated crypt epithelium and secondarily distributed in the subepithelial compartments of the stratified surface squamous epithelium. with a few ASCs located in the extrafollicular region. Their densities in these three areas were significantly decreased in turn (P<0.05). However. the densities of SIgA ASCs were significantly higher than IgG ASCs in the same regions (P<0.05). and the densities of both ASC populations decreased with age. The results confirmed that Bactrian camel palatine tonsils are the primary mucosal immune organ producing SIgA ASCs. and the subepithelial compartment of the reticulated crypt epithelium is the primary region for the colonization and functional activity of SIgA and IgG ASCs....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Ankylosing Spondylitis
50,In the present study. we reveal for the first time that the Bactrocera oleae chorion peroxidase (bPxd) participates essentially in B. oleaechorion formation and clearly represents the homologous member of Drosophila melanogaster chorion peroxidase (Pxd). Comparative sequence analysis disclosed that the bPxd cDNA semi-central region.which encodes for the putative catalytic domain of the enzyme. exhibits great homology (98%) with its Pxd counterpart. Thus. it is very likely that bPxd is highly responsible for the chorion hardening process. through protein cross-linking mediated by the formation of di- and tri-tyrosine bonds. Distinct molecular weight bPxd RNA transcripts were detected in Northern blotting analysis of total RNA extracts of adult flies (2.9 and 1.7 kb) and ovaries (2.2 kb). The ovarian-specific bPxd RNA transcript is selectively expressed in the follicle cell layer during the late stages of oogenesis 12-14. as revealed by in situ hybridization. Moreover. reverse transcription reactions confirmed the stage-specific developmental regulation of the bPxd gene. which is maximally expressed during stage 13. Western blotting with the rabbit anti-rAePO polyclonal antibody revealed three immunoreactive bands of 76. 66 and 54 kDa in crude protein extracts from adult flies. while in larva and purified chorion preparations. a unique 54 kDa band was clearly detected. Immunolocalization experiments revealed that bPxd peroxidase constitutes an essential structural chorionic component. being abundantly localized in all the successive chorionic layers and vitelline membrane as well....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Enzymology
51,The genus Potexvirus is one of the eight genera belonging to the family Alphaflexiviridae according to the Virus Taxonomy 2015 released by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (www. ictvonline. org/index. asp). Currently. the genus contains 35 known species including many agricultural important viruses. e.g.. Potato virus X (PVX). Members of this genus are characterized by flexuous. filamentous virions of 13 nm in diameter and 470-580 nm in length. A potexvirus has a monopartite positive-strand RNA genome. encoding five open-reading frames (ORFs). with a cap structure at the 5 0 end and a poly(A) tail at the 3 0 end. Besides PVX. Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) is another potexvirus that has received intensive attention due to the wealth of knowledge on the molecular biology of the virus. In this review. we discuss the enzymatic activities associated with each of the functional domains of the BaMV replication protein. a 155kDa polypeptide encoded by ORF1. The unique cap formation mechanism. which may be conserved across the alphavirus superfamily. is particularly addressed. The recently identified interactions between the replication protein and the plant host factors are also described....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Polymerase chain reaction
52,We constructed a SSH (suppression subtractive hybridization) library based on two populations (Rs-C and Rs-P) of Radopholus similis from different host plants and exhibiting differences in pathogenicity on Musa paradisiaca and Anthurium andraeanum plants. In order to screen the clones with significant expression differences from the SSH library. a total of 2.400 clones was randomly selected and reverse northern blotting was performed on them. Out of the 2.400 clones. 89 clones showed significant expression differences. Out of sequencing these 89 clones. distinct sequences from 87 clones were obtained. Aligning the 87 distinct sequences against the non-redundant nucleotide database (nr) in NCBI. we found that five sequences were highly conserved with Rs-eng-1b. Two of five sequences with lengths of 467 base pairs (bp) (GW395922) and 742 bp (GW395923) were further employed to perform 5' RACE-PCR and 3' RACE-PCR. respectively. Subsequently. the complete length of Rs-eng-1b (EU414839) was obtained (1.427 bp). Our qPCR result showed that expression of Rs-eng-1b in the population Rs-C with high pathogenicity on host plants was approximately 2.7 times as much as the expression of Rs-eng-1b in the population Rs-P with low pathogenicity on host plants. Furthermore. the gene Rs-eng-1b from the Rs-C population also showed expression differences amongst four different development stages. The order of Rs-eng-1b relative expression abundance from high to low was females. juveniles. males. and eggs. We further used RNAi to test whether Rs-eng-1b of Rs-C population was responsible for pathogenicity which was the first RNAi work about Rs-eng-1b. The RNAi results showed that Rs-eng-1b expression had a positive correlation to pathogenicity of the population. The longer the RNAi treatment. the less pathogenic the nematode population was. Non-endogenous gfp dsRNA had no significant influence on the expression of Rs-eng-1b and pathogenicity of R. similis Rs-C population. In conclusion. all our evidence indicated Rs-eng-1b might be a crucial pathogenicity-related gene in R. similis....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,DNA/RNA sequencing
53,Fusarium wilt. caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc). is among the most destructive diseases of banana (Musa spp.). Because no credible control measures are available. development of resistant cultivars through genetic engineering is the only option. We investigated whether intron hairpin RNA (ihpRNA)-mediated expression of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeted against vital fungal genes (velvet and Fusarium transcription factor 1) in transgenic banana could achieve effective resistance against Foc. Partial sequences of these two genes were assembled as ihpRNAs in suitable binary vectors (ihpRNA-VEL and ihpRNA-FTF1) and transformed into embryogenic cell suspensions of banana cv. Rasthali by Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. Eleven transformed lines derived from ihpRNA-VEL and twelve lines derived from ihpRNA-FTF1 were found to be free of external and internal symptoms of Foc after 6-week-long greenhouse bioassays. The five selected transgenic lines for each construct continued to resist Foc at 8 months postinoculation. Presence of specific siRNAs derived from the two ihpRNAs in transgenic banana plants was confirmed by Northern blotting and Illumina sequencing of small RNAs derived from the transgenic banana plants. The present study represents an important effort in proving that host-induced post-transcriptional ihpRNA-mediated gene silencing of vital fungal genes can confer efficient resistance against debilitating pathogens in crop plants....,biochemistry,CS,Northern blotting,Computer vision

57,This paper proposes a new CMOS based Bandgap voltage reference generator (BGR) circuit by using polysilicon resistors in 32nm CMOS technology. This reference generator uses a three stage operational amplifier for improved performance over previously proposed BGR circuits. The proposed design is simulated in Synopsys HSPICE simulator. This circuit produces an output reference voltage of 0.725V at the room temperature (25 degrees C) for the supply voltage of 1.8V. Analysis shows that. a very low temperature coefficient (TC) of 13ppm/degrees C is obtained in the output reference voltage for the temperature range of-40 degrees C to 100 degrees C.

59,Grid voltage feedforward is extensively used for controlling grid-connected converters. However. the conventional voltage feedforward control reduces the stability margins of the converter connected to a high-impedance grid. The effect mechanism of voltage feedforward on the grid-connected converter control under high-inductive conditions of the grid impedance is clearly explained in this study using the equivalent transformations of control block diagrams. Results show that the delay produced by the digital control is the root cause of this effect. An improved voltage feedforward strategy. in which a bandpass filter (BPF) is introduced into the feedforward path. is proposed to strengthen the converter's robust stability against grid impedance variations. The selection method of the BPF's bandwidth is also provided considering the tradeoff between the response speed to the grid voltage sag and the system's robust stability. The converter can work stably over a wide range of the grid impedance through the proposed approach. Simulation and experimental results fully verify the effectiveness of the BPF-based voltage feedforward strategy....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
60,In this paper a DVCC based operational amplifier has been proposed. A pole has been introduced in transfer characteristic of DVCC by an integrated capacitor. The op amp is composed of an on chip DVCC. one integrated NMOS resistor. a capacitor and a CMOS voltage follower. The bandwidth of DVCC op amp can be adjusted by voltage tuning of the resistor. Conventional voltage mode operational amplifiers suffer from introduction of second pole at high frequencies. thus rendering the circuits suitable for low frequency applications only. The proposed DVCC op amp has large signal bandwidth and can operate for wide range of frequencies. A bandpass filter has been tested using the reported op amp in PSPICE and theoretical analysis has been presented....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Operational amplifier

62,This paper presents the design and characterization of a fully-differential intermediate frequency (IF) filter based on an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) with 6th order Butterworth bandpass characteristic. The designed 2-stage BiCMOS OTA can be treated as an operational amplifier (OPAmp) together with its output resistance. The combination exhibits an open-loop voltage gain of 75 dB and high gainbandwidth product (GBP) of 5.8 GHz. while stability is achieved with a worst case phase margin (PM) of 54 degrees from a low bias-current of only 520 mu A. The multiple-feedback filter (MFB) elements for the target Butterworth frequency response are determined with circuit analysis based on an ideal OTA transfer function. The filter center frequency is set to 60 MHz. whereby a measured -3 dB-bandwidth of 15.5MHz is achieved. To enable the operation within an on-time of 200 ns the filter is able to settle at +/- 1 dB of its steady state amplitude in less than 115 ns. The filter was fabricated in the IHP 130nm BiCMOS technology and requires a current of only 1.6mA from a 2.5V-supply including all bias circuits....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
63,Baphicacanthus cusia (Nees) Bremek. the plant source for many kinds of drugs in traditional Chinese medicine. is widely distributed in South China. especially in Fujian. Recent studies about B. cusia mainly focus on its chemical composition and pharmacological effects. but further analysis of the plant's gene functions and expression is required to better understand the synthesis of its effective compounds. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a powerful method for gene expression analysis. It is necessary to select a suitable reference gene for expression normalization to ensure the accuracy of RT-qPCR results. Ten candidate reference genes were selected from the transcriptome datasets of B. cusia in this study. and the expression stability was assessed across 60 samples representing different tissues and organs under various conditions. including ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. hormonal stimuli (jasmonic acid methyl ester and abscisic acid). and in different plant organs. By employing different algorithms. such as geNorm. NormFinder. and BestKeeper. which are complementary approaches based on different statistical procedures. 18S rRNA was found to be the most stable gene under UV irradiation and hormonal stimuli. whereas ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 was the best suitable gene for different plant organs. This novel study aimed to screen for suitable reference genes and corresponding primer pairs specifically designed for gene expression studies in B. cusia. in particular for RT-qPCR analyses....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Genetics
64,This study had the aim to identify and relat the occurrence of billfish larvae and eggs in the Southeastern coast of Brazil.

66,Functional genomic screening of the rat enamel organ (EO) has led to the identification of a number of secreted proteins expressed during the maturation stage of amelogenesis. including amelotin (AMTN) and odontogenic ameloblast-associated (ODAM). In this study. we characterise the gene. protein and pattern of expression of a related protein called secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein-proline-glutamine-rich 1 (SCPPPQ1). The Scpppq1 gene resides within the secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein (Scpp) cluster. SCPPPQ1 is a highly conserved. 75-residue. secreted protein rich in proline. leucine. glutamine and phenylalanine. In silico data mining has revealed no correlation to any known sequences. Northern blotting of various rat tissues suggests that the expression of Scpppq1 is restricted to tooth and associated tissues. Immunohistochemical analyses show that the protein is expressed during the late maturation stage of amelogenesis and in the junctional epithelium where it localises to an atypical basal lamina at the cell-tooth interface. This discrete localisation suggests that SCPPPQ1. together with AMTN and ODAM. participates in structuring the basal lamina and in mediating attachment of epithelia cells to mineralised tooth surfaces....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Northern blotting
67,High metabolic activity and low levels of antioxidant enzymes make neurons particularly prone to damage by reactive oxygen species. Thus. repair of oxidative DNA damage is essential for normal brain function. Base excision repair is the major pathway for repair of oxidative DNA damage. and is initiated by DNA glycosylases recognizing and removing the damaged base. In mammalian cells at least five different DNA glycosylases with overlapping substrate specificity. NEIL1. NEIL2. NEIL3. OGG1 and NTH1. remove oxidative DNA base lesions. Here we report mRNA expression and distribution of these five DNA glycosylases in human and rodent brains using in situ hybridization and Northern blotting supported by glycosylase activity assays. NEIL1. NEIL2. OGG1 and NTH1 showed widespread expression at all ages. in situ hybridization studies in mouse brain showed that expression of mNeil1 increased with age. In newborn mouse brain. mNeil3 revealed a discrete expression pattern in brain regions known to harbour stem cell populations. i.e.. the subventricular zone. the rostral migratory stream. and the hilar region of the hippocampal formation. Expression of mNeil3 decreased with age. and in old mice brains could be detected only in layer V of neocortex. MNth1 was constitutively expressed during lifespan. in Northern blots. mOgg1 expression showed a transient decrease followed by an increase after 8 weeks of age. Assays for faPy DNA glycosylase activity revealed increased activity level with age in all brain regions analyzed....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
68,Currently there is no effective approach for monitoring early -cell loss during islet graft rejection following human islet transplantation (HIT). Due to ethical and technical constraints. it is difficult to directly study biomarkers of islet destruction in humans. Here. we established a humanized mouse model with induced human -cell death using adoptive lymphocyte transfer (ALT). Human islet grafts of ALT-treated mice had perigraft lymphocyte infiltration. fewer insulin(+) cells. and increased -cell apoptosis. Islet-specific miR-375 was used to validate our model. and expression of miR-375 was significantly decreased in the grafts and increased in the circulation of ALT-treated mice before hyperglycemia. A NanoString expression assay was further used to profile 800 human miRNAs in the human islet grafts. and the results were validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found that miR-4454 and miR-199a-5p were decreased in the human islet grafts following ALT and increased in the circulation prior to hyperglycemia. These data demonstrate that our in vivo model of induced human -cell destruction is a robust method for identifying and characterizing circulating biomarkers. and suggest that miR-4454 and miR-199a-5p can serve as novel biomarkers associated with early human -cell loss following HIT....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Diabetes
69,Regulatory T cell (Treg) therapy using recipient-derived Tregs expanded exvivo is currently being investigated clinically by us and others as a means of reducing allograft rejection following organ transplantation. Data from animal models has demonstrated that adoptive transfer of allospecific Tregs offers greater protection from graft rejection compared to polyclonal Tregs. Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) are clinically translatable synthetic fusion proteins that can redirect the specificity of T cells toward designated antigens. We used CAR technology to redirect human polyclonal Tregs toward donor-MHC class I molecules. which are ubiquitously expressed in allografts. Two novel HLA-A2-specific CARs were engineered: one comprising a CD28-CD3 signaling domain (CAR) and one lacking an intracellular signaling domain (CAR). CAR Tregs were specifically activated and significantly more suppressive than polyclonal or CAR Tregs in the presence of HLA-A2. without eliciting cytotoxic activity. Furthermore. CAR and CAR Tregs preferentially transmigrated across HLA-A2-expressing endothelial cell monolayers. In a human skin xenograft transplant model. adoptive transfer of CAR Tregs alleviated the alloimmune-mediated skin injury caused by transferring allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells more effectively than polyclonal Tregs. Our results demonstrated that the use of CAR technology is a clinically applicable refinement of Treg therapy for organ transplantation....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
70,Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) regulates pluripotent marker expression and cellular differentiation in various cell types. However. the mechanism by which bFGF regulates REX1 expression in stem cells. isolated from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the regulation of REX1 expression by bFGF in SHEDs. SHEDs were isolated and characterized. Their mRNA and protein expression levels were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. respectively. In some experiments. chemical inhibitors were added to the culture medium to impede specific signaling pathways. Cells isolated from human exfoliated deciduous tooth dental pulp tissue expressed mesenchymal stem cell surface markers (CD44. CD73. CD90. and CD105). These cells differentiated into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. when appropriately induced. Treating SHEDs with bFGF induced REX1 mRNA expression and this effect was attenuated by pretreatment with FGFR or Akt inhibitors. Cycloheximide pretreatment also inhibited the bFGF-induced REX1 expression. implying the involvement of intermediate molecule(s). Further. the addition of an IL-6 neutralizing antibody attenuated the bFGF-induced REX1 expression by SHEDs. In conclusion. bFGF enhanced REX1 expression by SHEDs via the FGFR and Akt signaling pathways. Moreover. IL-6 participated in the bFGF-induced REX1 expression in SHEDs. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals.

71,Rationale. aims and objectivesThe purpose of medical education is to produce competent and capable professional practitioners who can combine the art and science of medicine. Moreover. this process must prepare individuals to practise in a field in which knowledge is increasing and the contexts in which that knowledge is applied are changing in unpredictable ways. The basic sciences' are important in the training of a physician. The goal of basic science training is to learn it in a way that the material can be applied in practice. Much effort has been expended to integrate basic science and clinical training. while adding many other topics to the medical curriculum. This effort has been challenging. The aims of the paper are (1) to propose a unifying conceptual framework that facilitates knowledge integration among all levels of living systems from cell to society and (2) illustrate the organizing principles with two examples of the framework in action - cybernetic systems (with feedback) and distributed robustness. MethodsLiterature related to hierarchical and holarchical frameworks was reviewed. ResultsAn organizing framework derived from living systems theory and spanning the range from molecular biology to health systems management was developed. The application of cybernetic systems to three levels (regulation of pancreatic beta cell production of insulin. physician adjustment of medication for glycaemic control and development and action of performance measures for diabetes care) was illustrated. Similarly distributed robustness was illustrated by the DNA damage response system and principles underlying patient safety. ConclusionsEach of the illustrated organizing principles offers a means to facilitate the weaving of basic science and clinical medicine throughout the course of study. The use of such an approach may promote systems thinking. which is a core competency for effective and capable medical practice....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Diabetes
72,The feruloyl esterase (FAE) gene EST1 from the basidiomycete Pleurotus sapidus was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Catalytically active recombinant Est1 was secreted using P. pastoris as a host. For expression in P. pastoris. the expression vector pPIC9K was applied. The EST1 gene was cloned with an N-terminal a-mating factor pre-pro sequence and expressed under the control of a methanol inducible alcohol oxidase 1 promotor. Est1 was purified to homogeneity using ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The recombinant Est1 showed optima at pH 5.0 and 50 degrees C. and released ferulic acid from saccharide esters and from the natural substrate destarched wheat bran. Substrate specificity profile and descriptor-based analysis demonstrated unique properties. showing that Est1 did not fit into the current FAE classification model. Transferuloylation synthesis of feruloyl-saccharide esters was proven for mono- and disaccharides. (C) 2015 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Inc. Volume 63. Number 6.

73,Large collections of data in studies on cancer such as leukaemia provoke the necessity of applying tailored analysis algorithms to ensure supreme information extraction. In this work. a custom-fit pipeline is demonstrated for thorough investigation of the voluminous MILE gene expression data set. Three analyses are accomplished. each for gaining a deeper understanding of the processes underlying leukaemia types and subtypes. First. the main disease groups are tested for differential expression against the healthy control as in a standard case-control study. Here. the basic knowledge on molecular mechanisms is confirmed quantitatively and by literature references. Second. pairwise comparison testing is performed for juxtaposing the main leukaemia types among each other. In this case by means of the Dice coefficient similarity measure the general relations are pointed out. Moreover. lists of candidate main leukaemia group biomarkers are proposed. Finally. with this approach being successful. the third analysis provides insight into all of the studied subtypes. followed by the emergence of four leukaemia subtype biomarkers. In addition. the class enhanced DEG signature obtained on the basis of novel pipeline processing leads to significantly better classification power of multi-class data classifiers. The developed methodology consisting of batch effect adjustment. adaptive noise and feature filtration coupled with adequate statistical testing and biomarker definition proves to be an effective approach towards knowledge discovery in high-throughput molecular biology experiments....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
74,The aim of this study is to optimize the production of optically pure D (-) lactic acid (DLA) employing a cost-effective production medium. Based on the designed biomass approach. Sporolactobacillus inulinus NBRC 13595 was found to exhibit high DLA titer (19.0 g L-1) and optical purity (99.6%). A cost-effective medium was constituted using Palmyra palm jaggery (PJ) from Borassus flabellifer and whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) as carbon and nitrogen sources. respectively. Plackett-Burman design indicated that PJ. WPH. and MnSO4 as significant variables influence DLA production. A rotatable central composite design and response surface methodology were used to optimize the PJ and WPH concentrations. A maximum DLA titer (170.14 g L-1) was predicted for 222.24 g L-1 of PJ and 11.99 g L-1 of WPH. respectively. Fermentation experimental results exhibited a maximum DLA titer (189.0 +/- 8.53 g L-1) and productivity (5.25 +/- 0.24 g L-1 H-1). which is the highest ever reported for DLA production from a renewable feedstock in the batch process. The present investigation substantiates that the potential application of economically viable raw feedstocks (PJ and WPH) for enhanced DLA production. which is attributed to 2.5-fold reduction in DLA production cost compared with conventional medium.

75,Selection on floral traits in hermaphroditic plants is determined by both male and female reproductive success. However. predictions regarding floral trait and mating system evolution are often based solely on female fitness. Selection viamale fitness has the potential to affect the outcomes of floral evolution. In this study. we used paternity analysis to assess individual selfing rates and selection on floral traits via male and female fitness in an experimental population of Clarkia xantiana where pollen limitation of seed set was strong. We detected selection through both female and male fitness with reinforcing or noninterfering patterns of selection through the two sex functions. For female fitness. selection favored reduced herkogamy and protandry. traits that promote increased autonomous selfing. For male fitness. selection on petal area was disruptive. with higher trait values conferring greater pollinator attraction and outcross siring success and smaller trait values leading to higher selfed siring success. Combining both female and male fitness. selection on petal area and protandry was disruptive because intermediate phenotypes were less successful as both males and females. Finally. functional relationships among male and female fertility components indicated that selfing resulted in seed discounting and pollen discounting. Under these functional relationships. the evolutionarily stable selfing rate can be intermediate or predominantly selfing or outcrossing. depending on the segregating load of deleterious mutations....,Psychology,CS,Depression,Computer vision
76,This report describes the case of a 10-month-old infant. who was delivered to our hospital by the emergency physician intubated and in an unclear unconscious state. The father reported that the child had fallen from the couch to the ground. The consulted ophthalmologist reported venous stasis in both eyes including intraretinal and preretinal bleeding in all four quadrants. a diffuse vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye and temporal retinal wrinkling in both eyes. Based on these particular clinical findings a shaken baby syndrome was suspected. This report demonstrates the importance of recognizing and correctly interpreting the typical ophthalmological signs of physical child abuse in order to detect and prevent further mistreatment of children; moreover. the increasing importance of photographic documentation and histological work-up of the findings for forensic reasons are emphasized....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health
77,The objective of this study was to examine factors facilitating and constraining the identification and management of intimate partner violence (IPV) at an emergency department (ED). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 ED employees of a university hospital in the Netherlands. All interviews were audiotaped. transcribed verbatim. and analyzed by using qualitative content analysis in Atlas. ti. Constraining factors were lack of knowledge. awareness. and resources at the ED. ED employees felt many barriers to bringing up IPV. Facilitating factors were good cooperation among staff. the involvement of one team member in producing an IPV protocol. having received training on child abuse. and private consulting rooms. The ED setting and the ED employees' task perception and attitude contained both constraining and facilitating factors: ED employees saw it as their task and responsibility to help IPV victims. but their priorities were to secure a high turnover and treat acute physical problems. Although ED employees expressed openness and willingness to help. they also took the view that victims had a considerable responsibility of their own in disclosing and managing IPV. which led to ambivalent feelings. In conclusion. ED employees faced tensions in IPV identification and management caused by lack of awareness. knowledge and resources. conflicting priorities at the ED. and ambivalent feelings. Improvements can be made by supporting ED employees with guidelines in the form of a protocol and with training that also addresses the tensions ED employees face....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Emergency Contraception
78,In the United States. the judicial system response to violence between intimate partners. or intimate partner violence (IPV). typically mandates that adjudicated perpetrators complete a batterer intervention program (BIP). The social science data has found that these programs. on the whole. are only minimally effective in reducing rates of IPV. The authors examined the social science literature on the characteristics and efficacy of BIPs. More than 400 studies were considered. including a sweeping. recently conducted survey of BIP directors across the United States and Canada. Results of this review indicate that the limitations of BIPs are due. in large part. to the limitations of current state standards regulating these programs and. furthermore. that these standards are not grounded in the body of empirical research evidence or best practices. The authors. all of whom have considerable expertise in the area of domestic violence perpetrator treatment. conducted an exhaustive investigation of the following key intervention areas: overall effectiveness of BIPs; length of treatment/length of group sessions; number of group participants and number of facilitators; group format and curriculum; assessment protocol and instruments; victim contact; modality of treatment; differential treatment; working with female perpetrators; working with perpetrators in racial and ethnic minority groups; working with lesbian. gay. bisexual. and transgender (LGBT) perpetrators; perpetrator treatment and practitioner-client relationships; and required practitioner education and training. Recommendations for evidence-based national BIP standards were made based on findings from this review....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
79,Treatment of perpetrators is tried and tested albeit little researched for the prevention of recidivism in domestic violence in Germany. This study investigated the evidence of batterer programs on the risk of domestic violence recidivism and the risk of child maltreatment reported by fathers on 161 perpetrators of domestic violence. Based on the indicators for a high risk for reassault that were confirmed in international longitudinal studies. a risk inventory for domestic violence was developed and implemented in three German program sites. A shortened German version of the Child Abuse Potential Inventory and the Interpersonal- Reactivity- Index were used for perpetrators' self report. The study showed that the child abuse potential of program dropouts was significantly higher compared to program completers at baseline (n = 92). Longitudinal results showed significant improvements with moderate effect sizes in all risk indicators assessed by specialists (n = 78) and battered women (n = 44). Perpetrators' self report on cognitive empathy improved too (n = 62). However. selfreported risk of child maltreatment did not change (n = 46). No evidence of selective questioning of victims was found. A classification of the results as well as the implications for the treatment of perpetrators and research on recidivism in Germany are discussed....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
80,The deployment of renewable energy technologies. such as solar photovoltaics and wind turbines. poses challenges in terms of electricity grid stability due to the intermittent nature of such energy sources. which creates a need for innovative storage solutions. We demonstrate a metal hydride-based hybrid electrochemical system that enables a solid-oxide fuel cell to operate in both fuel cell mode and battery mode. allowing for un-interrupted electricity generation. In the fuel cell mode. the device acts as a conventional fuel cell and converts the chemical energy stored in fuels into electrical energy. In the battery mode. the metal hydride near the anode releases hydrogen and quickly responds to fuel supply interruption or power demand surges. The concept demonstrated here is a promising way to provide a robust and economical solution for balancing power supply and demand for the electrical grid of the future....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electrical generator
81,This paper introduces a module-integrated distributed battery energy storage and management system without the need for additional battery equalizers and centralized converter interface. This is achieved by integrating power electronics onto battery cells as an integrated module. Compared with the conventional centralized battery system. the modular design brings several advantages such as reduced power rating and voltage stress of power electronics. no extra equalizers or centralized converters. active thermal distribution control ability. enhanced safety and reliability. etc. The battery system can now be built by simply attaching integrated modules together. The integrated module is implemented by a synchronous bidirectional dc/dc converter with digital control techniques. The design considerations and control strategy of the system are discussed. A prototype is built that the power electronics are integrated onto the battery cell. Experimental results of a three-module system verified that the module-integrated distributed system provides satisfied functional performance without extra equalizers. centralized charger. or bidirectional dc/dc converter....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
82,The battery energy storage systems (BESSs) have been increasingly installed in the power system. especially with the growing penetration rate of the renewable energy sources. However. it is difficult for BESSs to be profitable due to high capital costs. In order to boost the economic value of BESSs. this paper proposes a hierarchical energy management system (HiEMS) to aggregate multiple BESSs. and to achieve multimarket business operations. The proposed HiEMS optimizes the multimarket bids considering a realistic BESS performance model. and coordinates the BESSs and manages their state of charge values. according to their price penalties based on dynamically generated annualized cost. By taking part in the energy market and regulation market at the same time. the cost-performance index (CPI) of the BESS aggregation is greatly improved. The impact of photovoltaic generation on system performance and CPI is also studied....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electricity
83,Battery energy storage (BES) plays an important role in the integration of intermittent renewable power and distributed generation. The price arbitrage is a major source of energy storage income. In China. the electricity price is tightly regulated by the government. It's interesting to find out whether the BES is economic viability in such a special electricity market. and what's the optimal response of the grid (or regulator) when facing the arbitrage activities of BES. This research starts with a price arbitrage model to evaluate the feasibility of energy storage in China's electricity market. which can be used to determine the optimal investment scale and operation mode of energy storage. A quantitative assessment is also implemented to discuss the influence when factors change. Following this. an optimal pricing strategy for grid is established. The results reveal that the storage investment can realize positive profit in some districts where the price gap between peak/off-peak periods is high. Appropriate subsidies can be quantitatively described by sensitivity analysis. In terms of social welfare. the energy storage can be deployed on a large-scale at a low social cost under a suitable price mechanism. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

84,This paper proposes a supervisory power management system (PMS) for a grid interactive microgrid with a hybrid energy storage system. The key feature of the proposed PMS is reduced number of sensors required to implement the PMS. The PMS considers renewable power variation. grid availability. electricity pricing. and changes in local loads. It can detect the operating mode of system without measuring load currents and powers. A single-phase voltage source converter (VSC) transfers real power between dc grid and utility grid besides offering ancillary services such as harmonic mitigation. reactive power support. and unity power factor at the point of common coupling (PCC). In the proposed system. a better dc-link voltage regulation is achieved and the usage of supercapacitors reduces the current stress on the battery. The PMS also addresses extreme operating conditions such as load shedding. off-maximum power point tracking operation of photovoltaic. elimination of critical oscillation of hybrid energy storage systems power. islanded operation. and resynchronization with grid. The performance of the proposed PMS is verified by digital simulation and experimental studies....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Single-phase electric power
85,In order to reduce the stress on fuel cell based hybrid source fed electric drive system the controller design is made through active current sharing (ACS) technique. The effectiveness of the proposed ACS technique is tested on a dc drive system fed from fuel cell and battery energy sources which enables both load current sharing and source power management. High efficiency and reliability of the hybrid system can be achieved by proper energy conversion and management of power to meet the load demand in terms of required voltage and current. To overcome the slow dynamics feature of FC. a battery bank of adequate power capacity has to be incorporated as FC voltage drops heavily during fast load demand. The controller allows fuel cell to operate in normal load region and draw the excess power from battery. In order to demonstrate the performance of the drive using ACS control strategy different modes of operation of the hybrid source with the static and dynamic behavior of the control system is verified through simulation and experimental results. This control scheme is implemented digitally in LabVIEW with PCI 6251 DAQ I/O interface card. The efficacy of the controller performance is demonstrated in system changing condition supplemented by experimental validation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

86,Herein. we present a fully integrated electronic product code (EPC) Gen-2 compatible battery-assisted passive (BAP) radio-frequency identification sensor tag integrated circuit (IC) with efficient power management. The key components of the tag IC include an adaptive radio-frequency (RF) energy harvester. a battery access controller (BAC). a storage capacitor charger. and a power-gated sensor block. External RF energy is efficiently harvested using dynamically controlled rectifying stages and a threshold-compensation technique. The BAC tightly controls the power path. cutting off leakage current from the battery. The power-gated sensor block supports multiplexed sensing operations in a power efficient manner. The sensor interface includes a chopper amplifier. a programmable gain amplifier. multiplexers. and an 8-bit ADC. For sensing data logging. custom designed nonvolatile memory is employed via one-time programmable memory. The digital control block is based on an EPCglobal Gen-2 standard that is modified to support the sensing operation. The tag chip was fabricated in a 1-poly 6-metal standard 0.18-mu m standard CMOS process. The tag IC consumes 1 mu A for leakage and active operation (0.1% duty). and the estimated lifespan of the BAP tag IC is about 0.2 year/mA.h....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Analog signal processing

88,Efficient performance modeling is an extremely important task for yield analysis and design optimization of analog circuits. In this paper. a novel regression modeling method based on hierarchical shrinkage priors is proposed to construct hybrid performance models with both high accuracy and low computational cost. In particular. the user-defined model templates derived from design equations and the general-purpose orthogonal polynomials are combined together to set up a hybrid dictionary. Next. in order to avoid over-shrinking large model coefficients. a novel regression method based on hierarchical shrinkage priors and variational Bayesian inference is adopted for model fitting. A rail-to-rail operational amplifier example demonstrates that the proposed method achieves up to 40% error reduction over other state-of-the-art approaches without increasing the modeling cost....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
89,We routinely observe others' choices and use them to guide our own. Whose choices influence us more. and why? Prior work has focused on the effect of perceived similarity between two individuals (self and others). such as the degree of overlap in past choices or explicitly recognizable group affiliations. In the real world. however. any dyadic relationship is part of a more complex social structure involving multiple social groups that are not directly observable. Here we suggest that human learners go beyond dyadic similarities in choice behaviors or explicit group memberships; they infer the structure of social influence by grouping individuals (including themselves) based on choices. and they use these groups to decide whose choices to follow. We propose a computational model that formalizes this idea. and we test the model predictions in a series of behavioral experiments. In Experiment 1. we reproduce a well-established finding that people's choices are more likely to be influenced by someone whose past choices are more similar to their own past choices. as predicted by our model as well as dyadic similarity models. In Experiments 2-5. we test a set of unique predictions of our model by looking at cases where the degree of choice overlap between individuals is equated. but their choices indicate a latent group structure. We then apply our model to prior empirical results on infants' understanding of others' preferences. presenting an alternative account of developmental changes. Finally. we discuss how our model relates to classical findings in the social influence literature and the theoretical implications of our model. Taken together. our findings demonstrate that structure learning is a powerful framework for explaining the influence of social information on decision making in a variety of contexts....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition

91,Objective. Conventional. multi-channel scalp electroencephalography (EEG) allows the identification of the attended speaker in concurrent-listening ('cocktail party') scenarios. This implies that EEG might provide valuable information to complement hearing aids with some form of EEG and to install a level of neuro-feedback. Approach. To investigate whether a listener's attentional focus can be detected from single-channel hearing-aid-compatible EEG configurations. we recorded EEG from three electrodes inside the ear canal ('in-Ear-EEG') and additionally from 64 electrodes on the scalp. In two different. concurrent listening tasks. participants (n = 7) were fitted with individualized in-Ear-EEG pieces and were either asked to attend to one of two dichotically-presented. concurrent tone streams or to one of two diotically-presented. concurrent audiobooks. A forward encoding model was trained to predict the EEG response at single EEG channels. Main results. Each individual participants' attentional focus could be detected from single-channel EEG response recorded from short-distance configurations consisting only of a single in-Ear-EEG electrode and an adjacent scalp-EEG electrode. The differences in neural responses to attended and ignored stimuli were consistent in morphology (i.e. polarity and latency of components) across subjects. Significance. In sum. our findings show that the EEG response from a single-channel. hearing-aid-compatible configuration provides valuable information to identify a listener's focus of attention....,Psychology,Medical,Attention,Alzheimer's Disease
92,In current brain computer interfacing (BCI) system is used for many applications. This technology also used for capturing brain signals in the form of EEG. This technique have intensive applications in non-invasive technique of signal capturing. Due to its temporal resolution. low set-up cost. easy portability compared to all other techniques. In the EEG technique. as we are dealing with very low frequency signals. these signals have plagued with various noise and interferences. so there is an urge for designing and implementing an accurate and stabilized system for acquiring these low frequency signals. This paper is aiming for VLSI design and testing of EEG acquisition system to acquire brain signals. Initially the low power and high gain generalized operational amplifier is designed. Later a suitable filter is designed to eliminate the noise signals produced in low frequency operations. in order to capture EEG signals. The generalized amplifier design of this system consists of differential amplifier followed with voltage follower circuit. The above circuit is designed using the Cadence tool which facilitates the capturing of transient response and generation of virtual layouts. Each and every blocks of the system is designed and tested individually. for each blocks virtual layouts are generated. And the transient response of the system which contains EEG signals with different voltage levels and frequencies are captured....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
93,Embryo implantation is a complex initial step in establishment of a successful pregnancy. Many mRNAs have been shown to be differentially expressed in the rat uterus during embryo implantation. However. the expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs). a key post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression. in the rat uterus between the pre-receptive and receptive phases are still unknown. Here. an miRNA microarray was used to examine differential expression of miRNAs in the rat uterus between the pre-receptive and receptive phases. Twenty-eight miRNAs were up-regulated and 29 miRNAs were down-regulated at least twofold during the receptive phase in rat uterus; these results were confirmed by Northern blotting. miR-29a was only highly expressed in rat uterus during the implantation period. and activation of delayed implantation and artificial decidualization enhanced the miR-29a level. Further investigation revealed that both the pro-apoptotic factor genes Bak1 and Bmf and the anti-apoptotic factor gene Bcl-w are targets of miR-29a. There was weak binding between miR-29a and the 3 UTR of the anti-apoptotic factor gene Mcl1. Over-expression of miR-29a inhibited the late apoptosis of endometrial stromal cells. which may be due to the stronger binding capacity between miR-29a and the 3 UTR of pro-apoptotic factors than that between miR-29a and the 3 UTR of anti-apoptotic factors. Collectively. miR-29a plays an important role during embryo implantation by regulating both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors. miR-29a may predominantly bind pro-apoptotic factors. leading to inhibition of cell apoptosis....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Cancer
94,Sequential measurement of BCR-ABL1 mRNA levels by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is embedded in the management of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). and has played an important role in the remarkable improvement in patient outcomes seen in this disease. As a provider of external quality assessment (EQA) in this area. UK NEQAS for Leucocyte Immunophenotyping (UKNEQAS LI) has a unique perspective on the changing face of BCR-ABL1 testing in CML. To assess the impact of technical standardisation and the development of the International Scale (IS) upon the accuracy of BCR-ABL1 testing. we reviewed EQA trial data from 2007 to 2015. Comparison of participant results identified considerable variability at both high and low levels of disease. including therapeutically important decision points; however. results converted to the IS showed less variability compared to unconverted data sets. We also found that different methods of converting to the IS produce consistently different median results within UKNEQAS LI IS data sets. This data suggests that whilst the development of the IS has improved the comparability of results between centres. there is still the need for further improvement in the processes of converting raw results to the IS in order to fully realise the benefits of molecular monitoring of CML....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Myelofibrosis
95,What is known and objectiveThe role of CYP3A5 in drug metabolism has been receiving attention because CYP3A5 may be more involved in the metabolism of CYP3A substrates in vivo than previously thought. The polymorphism of transporters. such as P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and breast cancer-related protein (BCRP). influences the metabolism of these substrates. and felodipine is a substrate of P-gp. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacogenetic variability in the disposition of felodipine in healthy Chinese subjects. MethodsA single dose of 5 mg felodipine was orally administered to 45 healthy Chinese subjects. The serum concentration of felodipine was measured by using LC/MS/MS. We detected the SNPs of cytochromes P450 enzymes and transporters. which play vital roles in drug metabolism and have a high frequency of mutation in Chinese population. Results and discussionThe area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) within the time points 0 to 72 h (AUC((0-72))) after felodipine administration was significantly higher in subjects possessing the BCRP421AA alleles than in those with the BCRP421 CC or CA genotype (P = 0034). The subjects with CYP3A5*3/*3 (n = 27) had higher felodipine exposure than CYP3A5*1/*3 (n = 15) (P = 0035). What is new and conclusionThis study showed that the genetic polymorphisms of CYP3A5*3 and BCRPC421A might explain the variability in the pharmacokinetics of felodipine in the Chinese population....,Psychology,Medical,Attention,Atrial Fibrillation
96,Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism has been associated with cortisol responses to stress with gender differences reported. although the findings are not entirely consistent. To evaluate the role of Val66Met genotype and gender on cortisol responses to stress. we conducted a 45-min mental stress protocol including four tasks and four rest periods. Blood cortisol was collected for assay immediately before and after each task and rest period. A significant two-way interaction of Val66Met genotype x gender (P= 0.022) was observed on the total area under the curve (AUC). a total cortisol response over time. such that the Val/Val genotype was associated with a larger cortisol response to stress as compared to the Met group in women but not in men. Further contrast analyses between the Val/Val and Met group for each stress task showed a similar increased cortisol pattern among women Val/Val genotype but not among men. The present findings indicate the gender differences in the effect of Val66Met genotype on the cortisol responses to stress protocol. and extend the evidence for the importance of gender and the role of Va166Met in the modulation of stress reactivity and subsequent depression prevalence. Further studies and the underlying mechanism need to be investigated. which may provide an insight for prevention. intervention. and treatment strategies that target those at high risk.

97,Aims Epidemiological studies strongly suggest a link between stress. depression. and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); the mechanistic correlation. however. is poorly understood. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the BDNF gene (BDNFVal66Met). associated with depression and anxiety. has been proposed as a genetic risk factor for CVD. Using a knock-in mouse carrying the BDNFVal66Met human polymorphism. which phenocopies psychiatric-related symptoms found in humans. we investigated the impact of this SNP on thrombosis. Methods and results BDNFMet/Met mice displayed a depressive-like phenotype concomitantly with hypercoagulable state and platelet hyper-reactivity. Proteomic analysis of aorta secretome from BDNFMet/Met and wild-type (WT) mice showed differential expression of proteins involved in the coagulation and inflammatory cascades. The BDNF Met allele predisposed to carotid artery thrombosis FeCl3-induced and to death after collagen/epinephrine injection. Interestingly. transfection with BDNFMet construct induced a prothrombotic/proinflammatory phenotype in WT cells. SIRT1 activation. using resveratrol and/or CAY10591. prevented thrombus formation and restored the physiological levels of coagulation and of platelet markers in BDNFMet/Met mice and/or cells transfected with the Met allele. Conversely. inhibition of SIRT1 by sirtinol and/or by specific siRNA induced the prothrombotic/proinflammatory phenotype in WT mice and cells. Finally. we found that BDNF Met homozygosity is associated with increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in humans. Conclusion Activation of platelets. alteration in coagulation pathways. and changes in vessel wall protein expression in BDNFMet/Met mice recapitulate well the features occurring in the anxiety/depression condition. Furthermore. our data suggest that the BDNFVal66Met polymorphism contribute to the individual propensity for arterial thrombosis related to AMI....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Heart Disease
98,A number of measures to increase the quality of data recorded with an improved Balzers Eldigraph KD-G2 gas-phase electron diffractometer are discussed. The beam-stop has been decoupled from the sector enabling us recording the current of the primary beam and scattered electrons during the experiment. Different beam-stops were tested for use in the present setup. Modifications of the nozzle tip of an earlier described medium temperature nozzle are reported. The measures lead to reduced exposure times and reduced amount of sample necessary for complete data collection....,ECE,biochemistry,Digital control,Northern blotting
99,Bearingless permanent magnet synchronous motors (BPMSMs) have been received more and more attention during the past few decades. To realize the high-performance control for rotation and levitation. we will first need to obtain the accurate suspension force model of a BPMSM. In this work. different from conventional suspension force models. a modeling scheme for the suspension force of a BPMSM is presented by taking into account rotor eccentricity with the Maxwell stress tensor modeling scheme. The theoretical value of a suspension force model is compared by the two-dimensional finite element (FE) analysis. and calculation results reveal that the theoretical value closely agree with the FE computed one. Furthermore. the digital control system is devised by taking advantage of TMS320F2812. and a test platform for experiments is then set up. In accordance with the corresponding findings of the experiments. the rotor stabilization with magnetic levitation can be achieved. The results lay a theoretical and experimental foundation for further study of the BPMSM....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Electric motor
0,Recently. bearingless switched reluctance motor (BLSRM) has been received more and more attention. To realize the stable levitation and rotation. the corresponding suspending force and torque should be controlled. In this paper. different from the conventional bearingless SRM control. one independent control scheme for levitation force and torque is presented. In the control. a complex control algorithm based on a lookup table is not needed. Torque control is separated from radial force control. and each channel of radial force is independently controlled. Therefore. the control is very simple to be implemented. First. based on the brief introduction of the BLSRM structure and operating principle. the mathematical relationship of levitation force with respect to current and displacement is derived. Furthermore. the rotor dynamics model. in which levitation force in four degrees of freedom is considered. is established. Based on the given analysis. the digital control system. which includes torque and suspending force. is designed by means of TMS320F28335. and an experimental platform is established. According to the experimental results. the proposed BLSRM can be steadily levitated in the static and rotating conditions....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Electric motor
1,Power electronic converters are single input multiple output (SIMO) systems in frequency domain. In distributed power system (DPS). one converter's switching frequency ripples are another converter's perturbations. and beat frequency components are generated due to their SIMO characteristics. As the control loops of power converters always take high gains in low-frequency regions if the beat frequency components are relatively low. they may be magnified and presented as oscillations. which will introduce system instability. This paper proposes a matrix-based multifrequency output impedance model to describe the SIMO characteristics of power converters and to analyze the stability of DPS. The buck converter is specifically illustrated as demonstration. The proposed model indicates that the variation of switching frequency. as well as those traditionally discussed parameters of control loops and passive components. could also change output impedance characteristics and introduce system instability. In DPS. the beat frequency oscillation that traditional models fail to explain could be accurately predicted by the proposed model. In addition. based on the proposed model. the switching frequencies for power converters can be optimized to improve the stability of power electronic-based systems. Simulation and experimental results validate the accuracy and the effectiveness of the proposed method....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
2,Current ambitions to limit climate change to no more than 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C by the end of the 21st century rely heavily on the availability of negative emissions technologies (NETs)-bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air capture in particular. In this context. these NETs are providing a specific service by removing CO2 from the atmosphere. and therefore investors would expect an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return. varying as a function of the quantity of public money involved. Uniquely. BECCS facilities have the possibility to generate both low carbon power and remove CO2 from the atmosphere. but in an energy system characterised by high penetration of intermittent renewable energy such as wind and solar power plants. the dispatch load factor of such BECCS facilities may be small relative to their capacity. This has the potential to significantly under utilise these assets for their primary purpose of removing CO2 from the atmosphere. In this study. we present a techno-economic environmental evaluation of BECCS plants with a range of operating efficiencies. considering their full-and part-load operation relative to a national-scale annual CO2 removal target. We find that in all cases. a lower capital cost. lower efficiency BECCS plant is superior to a higher cost. higher efficiency facility from both environmental and economic perspectives. We show that it may be preferable to operate the BECCS facility in base-load fashion. constantly removing CO2 from the atmosphere and dispatching electricity on an as-needed basis. We show that the use of this 'spare capacity' to produce hydrogen for. e.g. injection to a natural gas system for the provision of low carbon heating can add to the overall environmental and economic benefit of such a system. The only point where this hypothesis appears to break down is where the CO2 emissions associated with the biomass supply chain are sufficiently large so as to eliminate the service of CO2 removal....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electrical generator
3,Introduction: Depressive symptoms are common in patients assessed by neuropsychologists. and these symptoms can have an effect on cognitive functioning. Discrepancies between patient- and informant-reported depressive symptoms have been found in some diagnostic groups. raising concerns as to the value of assessing depressive symptoms via self-report alone. This study aimed to examine the relationship between these discrepancies and cognitive functioning in a heterogeneous outpatient neuropsychological sample. Method: Sixty-two patients with a variety of diagnoses (e.g.. stroke. mild cognitive impairment) completed a measure of depressive symptoms and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Informants also rated the patients' depressive symptoms and completed a measure of the patients' functional abilities. Results: Patient and informant reports of depressive symptoms were moderately correlated; larger differences between patient- and informant-reported symptoms were associated with poorer verbal learning and memory and greater functional impairments. Conclusions: The moderate level of agreement found for depressive symptoms is consistent with past studies using specific neuropsychological patient groups and other studies in both clinical and non-clinical populations. These results highlight the utility of collecting informant reports of depressive symptoms in neuropsychological evaluations....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Depression
4,Aim: The aim of this study was to determine Nigerian parents' views about the causes and treatment of childhood enuresis. Methods: Parents of children aged 5-17 years were individually interviewed in an urban community in Nigeria using a pretested questionnaire. Their responses about the causes and treatment of enuresis were grouped under common themes. Results: We included 448 respondents in the study: 75.5% were mothers. 44.2% had at least one child with enuresis and only 1.3% had spoken to a doctor about it. Enuresis was thought to be due to playing too much and drinking too much fluid at night by 69.7% and 21.2% of the respondents. respectively. The two most common treatment methods that parents were aware of for enuresis were waking to void (23.7%) and urinating on hot charcoal (20.8%). The most common methods that parents actually employed included waking to void (49.0%). punishing the child (36.9%) and doing nothing (28.8%). Conclusion: Most of the respondents believed that playing too much and drinking or eating too much were responsible for childhood enuresis. Parents rarely discussed childhood enuresis with their doctors and some of the self-help measures that were employed may be harmful and could constitute child abuse....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health
5,A full-length Beet black scorch virus (BBSV) cDNA clone (pUBF52) was constructed by RT-PCR. The clone contains an upstream T7 RNA polymerase promoter designed for in vitro transcription of infectious RNAs from the linearized plasmid that faithfully represent the viral cDNA. Leaves of Chenopodium amaranticolor inoculated with in vitro transcripts developed the same symptoms and disease phenotype as the wild type virus. The presence of BBSV RNA and coat protein in the leaves was confirmed respectively by Northern blotting and Western blotting. Comparisons of specific immunoreactions between the expression product of the BBSV p24 gene in E. coli and antiserum against purified BBSV virions demonstrated that the p24 gene encodes the coat protein. Based on the sequence of the pUBF52 cDNA. a frame-shift mutant and two deletion mutants were generated. One of the deletions encompasses the entire CP ORF and the other truncates 174 amino acids from the central region of the protein. Transcripts derived from the frame-shift CP mutant. which terminates the CP after the first 23 amino acids. elicited the same symptom phenotype and levels of RNA accumulation as the wild type virus. but the leaves infected with the CP deletion mutants exhibited greatly reduced RNA accumulation. In addition. leaves inoculated with in vitro transcripts of the mutant in which the entire CP gene was deleted had lower local lesions than wild type virus transcripts. Two expression vectors. pBGFP and pBGUS. were constructed by fusing the GFP and GUS genes to the 23 N-terminal amino acids of the CP gene. respectively. Leaves infected with in vitro transcripts of pBGFP and pBGUS exhibited expression of GFP and GUS proteins as assessed by laser confocal microscopy and histochemical staining. respectively. The high levels of expression of the GFP and GUS proteins provide tools that can be used for studies of replication and movement of the virus. and indicate that BBSV has considerable biotechnology potential as a plant virus expression vehicle....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
6,Co-infection of none-coding satellite RNAs (sat-RNAs) usually inhibits replication and attenuates disease symptoms of helper viruses. However. we find that the sat-RNA of Beet black scorch virus (BBSV) and low temperature (18 degrees C) additively enhance the systemic infection of BBSV in Nicotiana benthamiana. Northern blotting hybridization revealed a relatively reduced accumulation of BBSV-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in presence of sat-RNA as compared to that of BBSV alone. Cloning and sequencing of total small RNAs showed that more than 50% of the total small RNAs sequenced from BBSV-infected plants were BBSV-siRNAs. whereas the abundance of sat-siRNAs were higher than BBSV-siRNAs in the sat-RNA co-infected plants. indicating that the sat-RNA occupies most of the silencing components and possibly relieves the RNA silencing-mediated defense against BBSV. Interestingly. the 5' termini of siRNAs derived from BBSV and sat-RNA were dominated by Uridines (U) and Adenines (A). respectively. Besides. the infection of BBSV alone and with sat-RNA induce down-regulation of miR168 and miR403. respectively. which leads to high accumulation of their targets. Argonaute 1 (AGO1) and AGO2. Our work reveals the profiles of siRNAs of BBSV and sat-RNA and provides an additional clue to investigate the complicated interaction between the helper virus and sat-RNA...,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,DNA/RNA sequencing
7,This study examines whether the delivery of three components. (a) exercise training. (b) behavior management skill building. and (c) dementia-related education. in an evidence-based program are differentially associated with changes in outcomes for individuals with dementia (IWDs) after 3 months. Data come from 508 IWDs participating in the community replication of the evidence-based Reducing Disability in Alzheimer's Disease program. Regression results indicate that after 3 months. more exercise sessions are associated with improvements in physical functioning. mobility. minutes exercising. and symptoms of depression; more dementia education sessions are related to fewer restricted activity days; and more behavior management sessions are related to more symptoms of depression. As resource-strapped agencies look to best serve participants. further analysis and consideration is needed to determine the ideal balance of program efficacy. feasibility. and resources. as well as program benefits for IWDs and caregivers....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Dementia
8,Depression is associated with decreased engagement in behavioural activities. A wide range of activities can be promoted by simulating them via mental imagery. Mental imagery of positive events could thus provide a route to increasing adaptive behaviour in depression. The current study tested whether repeated engagement in positive mental imagery led to increases in behavioural activation in participants with depression. using data from a randomized controlled trial (Blackwell et al. in Clin Psychol Sci 3(1):91-111. 2015. doi:10.1177/2167702614560746). Participants (N = 150) were randomized to a 4-week positive imagery intervention or an active non-imagery control condition. completed via the internet. Behavioural activation was assessed five times up to 6 months follow-up using the Behavioural Activation for Depression Scale (BADS). While BADS scores increased over time in both groups. there was an initial greater increase in the imagery condition. Investigating mental imagery simulation of positive activities as a means to promote behavioural activation in depression could provide a fruitful line of enquiry for future research....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Depression
9,We propose a simulation-based analog equivalence boundary search methodology for high level Simulink models and their low level HSpice counterparts. The equivalence of high and low level designs is determined by comparing a set of predefined performance parameters measured during the simulation of both models. Our methodology investigates the search space to obtain boundary of input parameters. where both models have equivalent performance parameters. We build an optimization problem. where the error percentage between the performance parameters of both models being less than a specified threshold is defined as success criteria. In this problem. input parameters are determined by utilizing evolutionary computation. At the end of the optimization. the border of equivalence for the models is found for input parameters satisfying the success criteria. We demonstrate the validity of our approach on three designs. an inverter. an operational amplifier. and a buck converter. where our approach proves to be an efficient tool in finding an equivalence boundary of analog circuits and models.

10,Symbolically generated network functions for an analog integrated circuit are complicated in general. For this reason a variety of simplification methods have been proposed in the literature. In this work a novel topology-based symbolic simplification method is proposed. which is capable of generating a simplified symbolic network function together with a simplified small-signal circuit. The technique is developed by applying the recently proposed graph-pair decision diagram (GPDD) algorithm that generates a symbolic network function stored in a binary decision diagram (BDD). Two types of element elimination can directly be operated on such a GPDD data structure. The performance variation by eliminating each symbol from the original circuit is assessed by the means of two monitored response metrics (dc gain and phase margin). After sorting the performance loss. those circuit elements with less performance loss are eliminated. resulting in a reduced GPDD which is automatically a simplified network function. A simplified small-signal circuit is available simultaneously after reduction. Applications to two operational amplifier examples confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methodology....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing

And a parameter for describing the external environment is introduced to make the model combined with TID. Finally. an example is used to illustrate the TID effect on the operational amplifier of MC14573. proving the validity of the model....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Operational amplifier
12,Introduction. Behavioral changes often occur after moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can lead to poor health. psychosocial functioning. and quality of life. Challenges in evaluating these behaviors often result from the complexity and variability in the way they are conceptualized and defined. We propose and test a conceptual model that is specific to behavioral symptoms after TBI. to serve as a basis for better assessment and treatment. We hypothesized that clusters of individuals. with unique emotional. cognitive. and behavioral characteristics. would emerge that would illustrate this conceptual model. Methods. We conducted model-based cluster analyses in two cohorts. 6-months post-injury (n=79) and >6months post-injury (n=62). of adults with moderate-to-severe TBI to explore the face validity of our conceptual model by evaluating how participants clustered with regard to emotional (Patient Health Questionnaire 9. Positive and Negative Affect Schedule). cognitive (neuropsychological test battery). and frontal behavioral (Frontal Systems Behavior Scale) symptoms. Results. In each cohort. unique clusters of participants emerged that differed significantly with regard to emotional state. cognition. and behavior (ps6months) demonstrated a more complex pattern of symptoms; the most severe behavioral symptoms occurred in the context of severe emotional symptoms. even in the absence of cognitive impairment. However. problematic behavioral symptoms were also present in the context of severe cognitive impairment. even in the absence of emotional symptoms. Conclusions. Emotional. cognitive. and behavioral characteristics were represented as expected. based on the proposed conceptual model of behavior. This conceptual model provides the basis for evaluating behavioral changes after moderate-to-severe TBI and identifying modifiable targets and relevant subpopulations for behavioral intervention. with the goal of improved evidence-based personalized medicine for this population....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Schizophrenia
13,Semantic dementia (SD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). subtypes of frontotemporal dementia. are characterized by distinct clinical symptoms and neuroimaging features. with predominant left temporal grey matter (GM) atrophy in SD and bilateral or right frontal GM atrophy in bvFTD. Such differential hemispheric predilection may also be reflected by other neuroimaging features. such as brain connectivity. This study investigated white matter (WM) microstructure and functional connectivity differences between SD and bvFTD. focusing on the hemispheric predilection of these differences. Eight SD and 12 bvFTD patients. and 17 controls underwent diffusion tensor imaging and resting state functional MRI at 3T. Whole-brain WM microstructure was assessed to determine distinct WM tracts affected in SD and bvFTD. For these tracts. diffusivity measures and lateralization indices were calculated. Functional connectivity was established for GM regions affected in early stage SD or bvFTD. Results of a direct comparison between SD and bvFTD are reported. Whole-brain WM microstructure abnormalities were more pronounced in the left hemisphere in SD and bilaterally-with a slight predilection for the right-in bvFTD. Lateralization of tract-specific abnormalities was seen in SD only. toward the left hemisphere. Functional connectivity of disease-specific regions was mainly decreased bilaterally in SD and in the right hemisphere in bvFTD. SD and bvFTD show WM microstructure and functional connectivity abnormalities in different regions. that are respectively more pronounced in the left hemisphere in SD and in the right hemisphere in bvFTD. This indicates differential hemispheric predilection of brain connectivity abnormalities between SD and bvFTD....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Parkinson's Disease
14,Aims: To conduct a pilot trial to test the feasibility of a guided self-help intervention for chronic orofacial pain. Methods: A pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the intervention with usual treatment. A total of 37 patients with chronic orofacial pain were randomized into either the intervention group (n = 19) or the usual treatment (control) group (n = 18). Validated outcome measures were used to measure the potential effectiveness of the intervention over a number of domains: physical and mental functioning (Short Form 36 [SF-36]); anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]); pain intensity and interference with life (Brief Pain Inventory [BPI]); disability (Manchester Orofacial Pain Disability Scale [MOPDS]); and illness behavior (Revised Illness Perceptions Questionnaire [IPQr]). Bootstrap confidence intervals were computed for the treatment effect (ES) posttreatment and at 3 months follow-up and adjusted for baseline values of the outcome measure by using analysis of covariance. Results: At posttreatment and the 3-month follow-up. 11 participants in the intervention group and 7 in the control group failed to complete outcome measures. The intervention was acceptable and could be feasibly delivered face to face or over the telephone. Although the pilot trial was not powered to draw conclusions about the effectiveness. it showed significant (P <.05) effects of the intervention on physical and mental functioning and treatment control. Conclusion: The self-help intervention was acceptable to patients and allowed them to better understand and self-manage chronic orofacial pain. It showed potential effectiveness on outcome domains related to functioning and illness perception. Further research is needed to understand the cost effectiveness of the intervention for chronic orofacial pain....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Headache
15,Imagination pushes humanity well beyond its natural biological capacities. An approach of co-evolution. between molecular biology and behaviour. is thus required to explain these combined processes. Technological performances define spiritual conquests and formulas whose sole function is cultural. Humanity operates according to intentional social modes defined by the group. but these immediately become conditions for their own evolution. These choices are the motor for the history of humanity. and thus humanity can itself choose its own path. Anatomic modernisation is only a distant reflection of bipedalism. but freeing the hands leads to the development of abstract thought. The relationship between anatomy and awareness allows infinite variations in the harmonious adaptation to nature. animals and other societies. In Europe. humanity arrived in abrupt bursts because it was the result of external evolution. continuous and distant. dispersed across Asia. By its unceasing audacity. humanity combats biological determinism. imposing "moral" rules. or imperatives. The balance between biology and culture is reflected in the rules for sharing food: the biological life itself is coded by social sharing. These systems take on ternary values as soon as they include animal behaviours. Built shelters integrate societies with the cosmos because they delimit cultural spaces within natural chaos. Mastery of cognitive mechanisms gives humanity an entirely new responsibility. that of being able to define its destiny. Our united disciplines are transformed into ethical requirements.

16,Faces play an integral role in day-to-day functioning. particularly for social interactions where dynamic and rapid processing of information is vital. Analysis of faces allows an individual to ascertain a wide range of information including deciphering mood and identity. with these assessments directing an individual's subsequent response and behaviours. The prominent social and emotional deficits observed in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). a youngeronset dementia syndrome. may in part reflect a breakdown of the face processing network. Different subtypes of FTD present with divergent patterns of atrophy. although damage is predominantly confined to the frontal and temporal lobes. Specific predictions regarding the role of frontal and temporal regions in face processing have been proposed in the model outlined by Haxby et al. Trends in Cognitive Sciences. 4(6). 223-233 (2000). This model presents a parsimonious method by which to understand face processing in FTD while concurrently allowing assessment of the predictive value and applicability of such a model. By applying the Haxby model to the existing FTD literature. this review presents both direct and indirect evidence of a breakdown in key elements of the face processing network. The type and degree of breakdown appears to differ as a function of FTD subtype and associated brain atrophy. The evidence presented in this review and its relationship with predictions of the Haxby model provides impetus and direction for future research investigating face processing in FTD....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Dementia

18,Beliefs about the unacceptability of experiencing and expressing emotions have been found to be related to worse outcomes in people with persistent physical symptoms. The current study tested mediation models regarding emotional suppression. beliefs about emotions. support-seeking and global impact in fibromyalgia. One hundred eighty-two participants took part in an online questionnaire testing potential mechanisms of this relationship using mediation analysis. The model tested emotional suppression and affective distress as serial mediators of the relationship between beliefs about emotions and global impact. In parallel paths. two forms of support-seeking were tested (personal/emotional and symptom-related support-seeking) as mediators. Emotional suppression and affective distress significantly serially mediated the relationship between beliefs about emotions and global impact. Neither support-seeking variable significantly mediated this relationship. Results indicate a potential mechanism through which beliefs about emotions and global impact might relate which might provide a theoretical basis for future research on treatments for fibromyalgia....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Borderline personality disorder
19,The prostate is composed mainly of epithelial and stromal cells. whose dynamic interaction is vital to a broad array of cellular processes. including proliferation. differentiation. growth. and apoptosis. To understand intercellular communication in the development and progression of prostatic diseases. we examined gene expression in tissues from five patients diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Fibroblasts and epithelial cells derived from these tissues were grown in a primary co-culture system that retains many characteristics of the intact human prostate. The mRNA levels of expressed genes as assessed by differential-display reverse transcription-PCR revealed that 110 genes were differentially expressed in co-cultured fibroblasts and epithelial cells. compared with expression in separately cultured cells. Eighty-four of these were confirmed by reverse Northern blotting. and 68 were successfully sequenced. Of the sequenced genes. 43 were differentially expressed in epithelial cells (37 upregulated. 6 downregulated). and 25 were differentially expressed in fibroblasts (6 upregulated. 19 downregulated) in co-cultures versus separate cultures. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of 12 genes with known functions showed that five of these were differentially expressed in co-cultured cells. Human kallikrein gene 7 (KLK7) was markedly upregulated in co-cultured compared with separately cultured epithelial cells (P<0.001). whereas S100 calcium binding protein All. tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein. cyclin I. and latexin were significantly downregulated in co-cultured fibroblasts (P<0.05). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis confirmed KLK7 up-regulation at both the mRNA and protein levels. respectively. Thus. epithelial-stromal cell interaction and communication are likely to be important in BPH. Epithelial cells and fibroblasts may interplay coordinately or collaboratively to influence cellular growth and death through dynamically differential gene expression in response to physiological and pathophysiological changes....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Cancer
20,All clinically-used antipsychotics display similar affinity for both D-2 (D2R) and D-3 (D3R) receptors. and they likewise act as 5-HT2A receptor antagonists. They provide therapeutic benefit for positive symptoms. but no marked or consistent improvement in neurocognitive. social cognitive or negative symptoms. Since blockade of D-3 and 5-HT6 (5-HT6R) receptors enhances neurocognition and social cognition. and potentially improves negative symptoms. a promising approach for improved treatment for schizophrenia would be to develop drugs that preferentially act at D3R versus D2R and likewise recognize 5-HT6R. Starting from the high affinity 5-HT6R ligands I and II. we identified compounds 11a and 14b that behave as 5-HT6R ligands with significant selectivity for D3R over D2R. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

21,Selective inhibitors of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) are an emerging class of pharmaceuticals due to the involvement of HDAC6 in different pathways related to neurodegenerative diseases. cancer. and immunology. Herein. the synthesis of ten new benzohydroxamic acids. constructed by employing the tetrahydrobenzothiazepine core as a privileged pharmacophoric unit. is described. This is the first report on the synthesis and isolation of octahydrodibenzothiazepines and octahydro-6H-benzocycloheptathiazepines. which were then used to develop a new class of HDAC6 inhibitors.

22,Berberine is traditionally used to treat gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders. The interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) are the pacemaker cells of the gastrointestinal tract. which are responsible for the production of gut movements. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of berberine on pacemaker potentials (PPs) in cultured ICC clusters from the mouse small intestine. and sought to identify the receptors involved and the underlying mechanisms of action. All experiments were performed on cultured ICCs. and a whole-cell patch-clamp configuration was used to record PPs from ICC clusters (current clamp mode). Under current clamp mode. berberine was shown to decrease the amplitude and frequency of PPs. However. these effects were suppressed by treatment with glibenclamide. a specific ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker. Nor-binaltorphimine dihydrochloride (a kappa opioid receptor antagonist) did not suppress berberine-induced PP inhibition. whereas ICI 174.864 (a delta opioid receptor antagonist) and CTOP (a mu opioid receptor antagonist) did suppress the inhibitory effects of berberine. Pretreatment with SQ-22536 (an adenylate cyclase inhibitor) or with KT-5720 (a protein kinase A inhibitor) did not suppress the effects of berberine; however. pretreatment with 1H-[1.2.4] oxadiazolo [4.3-a] quinoxalin-1-one (a guanylate cyclase inhibitor) or KT-5823 [a protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor] did. In addition. berberine stimulated cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production in ICCs. These observations indicate that berberine may inhibit the pacemaker activity of ICC clusters via ATP-sensitive K+ channels and the cGMP-PKG-dependent pathway by stimulating mu and delta opioid receptors. Therefore. berberine may provide a basis for the development of novel agents for the treatment of GI motility dysfunction....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Digestive Health
23,Psychological adaptation following homicide loss can prove more challenging for grievers than other types of losses. Although social support can be beneficial in bereavement. research is mixed in terms of identifying whether it serves as a buffer to distress following traumatic loss. In particular. studies have not parsed out specific domains of social support that best predict positive bereavement outcomes. Recruiting a sample of 47 African Americans bereaved by homicide. we examined six types of social support along with the griever's perceived need for or satisfaction with each and analyzed them in relation to depression. anxiety. complicated grief. and posttraumatic stress disorder outcomes. Results of multivariate analyses revealed that the griever's level of satisfaction with physical assistance at the initial assessment best predicted lower levels of depression. anxiety. and posttraumatic stress disorder levels 6 months later. while less need for physical assistance predicted lower complicated grief at follow-up. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Depression
24,Mental health issues have been increasingly recognized as public health problems globally. Their burden is projected to increase over the next several decades. Additional therapies for mental problems are in urgent need worldwide due to the limitations and costs of existing healthcare approaches. Essential oil aromatherapy can provide a cost-effective and safe treatment for many mental problems. This pilot study observed the effects of bergamot essential oil inhalation on mental health and well-being. as measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Scale. in a mental-health treatment center located in Utah. USA. Fifty-seven eligible participants (50 women. age range: 23-70years) were included for analysis. Fifteen minutes of bergamot essential oil exposure improved participants' positive feelings compared with the control group (17% higher). Unexpectedly. more participants participated in experimental periods rather than control periods. suggesting even brief exposure to essential oil aroma may make people more willing to enroll in clinical trials. This study provides preliminary evidence of the efficacy and safety of bergamot essential oil inhalation on mental well-being in a mental health treatment center. suggesting that bergamot essential oil aromatherapy can be an effective adjunct treatment to improve individuals' mental health and well-being.

25,It has been shown in vitro that only specific dietary fibers contribute to immunity. but studies in vivo are not conclusive. Here. we investigated degree of polymerization (DP) dependent effects of beta 2 ->1-fructans on immunity via microbiota-dependent and-independent effects. To this end. conventional or germ-free mice received short-or long-chain beta 2 ->1-fructan for 5 days. Immune cell populations in the spleen. mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). and Peyer's patches (PPs) were analyzed with flow cytometry. genome-wide gene expression in the ileum was measured with microarray. and gut microbiota composition was analyzed with 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples. We found that beta 2 ->1-fructans modulated immunity by both microbiota and microbiota-independent effects. Moreover. effects were dependent on the chain-length of the beta 2 ->1-fructans type polymer. Both short-and long-chain beta 2 ->1-fructans enhanced T-helper 1 cells in PPs. whereas only short-chain beta 2 ->1-fructans increased regulatory T cells and CD11b(-)CD103(-)dendritic cells (DCs) in the MLN. A common feature after short-and long-chain beta 2 ->1-fructan treatment was enhanced 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase 2 expression and other IL-22-dependent genes in the ileum of conventional mice. These effects were not associated with shifts in gut microbiota composition. or altered production of short-chain fatty acids. Both short-and long-chain beta 2 ->1-fructans also induced immune effects in germ-free animals. demonstrating direct effect independent from the gut microbiota. Also. these effects were dependent on the chain-length of the beta 2 ->1-fructans. Short-chain beta 2 ->1-fructan induced lower CD80 expression by CD11b(-)CD103(-) DCs in PPs. whereas long-chain beta 2 ->1-fructan specifically modulated B cell responses in germ-free mice. In conclusion. support of immunity is determined by the chemical structure of beta 2 ->1-fructans and is partially microbiota independent....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Digestive Health
26,Interferon beta (IFNb) preparations are commonly used as first-line therapy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). They are. however. characterized by limited efficacy. partly due to the formation of anti-IFNb antibodies in patients. In this pilot study. we assessed with the ELISA method the presence of the binding antibodies (BAbs) against interferon beta after 2 years of therapy with subcutaneous interferon beta 1a (Rebif) in 49 RRMS patients. Antibody levels were established again within 1 year after treatment withdrawal. We used 3 interferons that are commercially available for MS therapy. namely Avonex (Biogen Idec Limited). Rebif (Merck Serono). and Betaferon (Bayer Pharma AG). as antigens. BAbs reacting with Rebif were found in 24.4% to 55% of patients. depending on the units of their expression. The levels of anti-ebif antibodies remained high in 8 patients and in 4 patients they dropped significantly. Strong correlations were obtained in all assays (anti-Rebif-anti-Avonex. anti-Rebif-anti-Betaferon. and anti-Betaferon-anti-Avonex) and the existence of cross-reactivity in the formation of antibodies against all the tested formulations of interferon beta was confirmed. The levels of BAbs remain significant in the clinical context. and their assessment is the first choice screening; however. methods of BAbs evaluation can be crucial for further decisions. More studies are needed to confirm our results; specifically it would be of interest to evaluate methods of neutralizing antibodies identification. as we only assessed the binding antibodies. Nevertheless. our results support the concept that in interferon nonresponders. that are positive for binding antibodies. switching the therapy to alternative disease-modifying agent (for example glatiramer acetate. fingolimod. or natalizumab) is justified. whereas the switch to another interferon formulation will probably be of no benefit....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Multiple Sclerosis
27,Plant beta-1. 3-glucanases are involved in plant defense and in development. Very little data are available on the expression of rice glucanases both in developmental tissues and under various stresses. In this study. we cloned and characterized twenty-seven rice beta-1. 3-glucanases (OsGlu) from at total of 71 putative glucanases. The OsGlu genes were obtained by PCR from a cDNA library and were classified into seven groups (Group I to VII) according to their DNA or amino acid sequence homology. Analysis of the expression of the twenty-seven OsGlu genes by Northern blotting revealed that they were differentially expressed in different developmental tissues as Well as in response to plant hormones. biotic stress. high salt etc. OsGlu11 and 27 in Group IV were clearly expressed only in stem and leaf and were also induced strongly by SA (5 mM). ABA (200 mu M). and M. grisea. OsGlu1. 10. 11. and 14 were induced earlier and to higher levels in incompatible M. grisea interaction than in compatible one. Taken together. our findings suggest that the twenty-seven rice OsGlu gene products play diverse roles not only in plant defense but also in hormonal responses and in development....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Enzymology
28,Backgound: beta-Carotene exhibits biological activity as provitamin A. Key step in vitamin A formation is the cleavage of beta-carotene to retinal by an enzyme designated as beta-carotene 15.15'-monooxygenase (BCM). Recently. it is reported that expression of BCM gene in the intestine is under feedback regulation by retinoic acid (RA). However. the regulation of BCM gene expression in various other tissues is still unknown. Aim of the study: In the present study. we identified the full-length cDNA encoding the rat BCM gene and investigated the regulation of its expression in several tissues by RA in the presence of vitamin A deficiency. Methods: We cloned the full-length cDNA encoding BCM gene from a rat intestinal cDNA library by hybridization screening. The BCM gene expression was examined using Northern blotting and reverse transcription-PCR analysis. We also investigated whether BCM gene expression was regulated by retinoids in several tissues of vitamin A-deficient rats. Results: Sequence analysis of this clone revealed an open reading frame of 1.701 bases encoding a protein of 566 amino acids. The predicted polypeptide showed 94%. 81%. and 66% identity with mouse. human. and chicken BCM. respectively. Rat BCM mRNA was highly expressed in the intestine and liver. while there was weak expression in the testes. kidneys. and lungs. Immunoblotting revealed that rat BCM is a 64-kDa protein. BCM gene expression was increased in the small intestine by vitamin A deficiency compared with that in rats on a control diet. while this upregulation was suppressed by all-trans RA (ATRA) or 9-cis RA (9-cis RA). BCM gene expression in the lungs and testes was also suppressed by ATRA or 9-cis RA in rats with vitamin A deficiency. However. hepatic BCM gene expression was only decreased by ATRA and renal expression was not affected by either retinoid. As the small intestine is the major site of beta-carotene conversion. intestinal BCM gene expression may be more tightly regulated. Conclusion: These data suggest that BCM gene expression in several tissues may be down-regulated by RA at the level of conversion of beta-carotene to retinal. To prevent an excess of retinol. homeostasis may occur at the level of conversion of beta-carotene to retinal in several tissues....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
29,To efficiently express a gene of interest in transgenic plants. the choice of promoter is a crucial factor as it directly affects the expression of the transgene that will yield the desired phenotype. The Arabidopsis beta-carotene hydroxylase 1 gene (AtBch1) shows constitutive and ubiquitous expression and was thus selected as one of best candidates for constitutive promoter analysis by both in silico northern blotting and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. To investigate AtBch1 promoter activity. the 1.981-bp 5'-upstream region of this gene was fused with beta-glucuronidase (GUS) and transformed into Arabidopsis. Through the molecular characterization of transgenic leaf tissues. the AtBch1 promoter generated strong activity that drives 1.8- and 2-fold higher GUS expression than the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (35S) promoter at the transcriptional and translational levels. respectively. Furthermore. the GUS enzyme activity driven by the AtBch1 promoter was 2.8-fold higher than that produced by the 35S promoter. By histochemical GUS staining. the ubiquitous expression of the AtBch1 promoter was observed in all tissues of Arabidopsis. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis with different tissues further showed that this promoter serves as a strong constitutive driver of transgene expression in dicot plants....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
30,This work was conducted to prepare beta-caryophyllene-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex (HP beta CD/BCP) and investigate its effects and mechanisms on cognitive deficits in vascular dementia (VD) rats. First. HP beta CD/BCP was prepared. optimized. characterized. and evaluated. HP\CD/BCP and AM630 were then administered to VD rats to upregulate and downregulate the cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2). Results showed that HP beta CD/BCP can significantly increase the bioavailability of BCP. Through the Morris water maze test. HP beta CD/BCP can attenuate learning and memory deficits in rats. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) monitoring results indicated that HP beta CD/BCP can promote the recovery of CBF. Moreover. molecular biology experiments showed that HP beta CD/BCP can increase the expression levels of CB2 in brain tissues. particularly the hippocampus and white matter tissues. as well as the expression levels of PI3K and Akt. Overall. the findings demonstrated the protective effects of HP beta CD/BCP against cognitive deficits induced by chronic cerebral ischemia and suggested the potential of HP beta CD/BCP in the therapy of vascular dementia in the future....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Parkinson's Disease
31,A novel type of pH-responsive star polymer based on beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) was synthesized and further covalently conjugated with enzyme. The impact of its self-assembly behavior on enzyme activity was investigated. In our design. azide containing the polymer (N-3)(7)-beta-CD-(PtBA)(14) was synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization of tert-butyl acrylate using (N-3)(7)-beta CD-(Br)(14) as the multifunctional initiator. The final product (N-3)(7)-beta-CD-(PAA)(14) was obtained via hydrolysis and covalently conjugating pectinase onto pH-responsive polyacrylic acid (PAA) arms. PAA can change its conformation with the self-assembly by altered pH. leading its nanostructure into micellar nanoparticles in aqueous solution and further affecting the activity of immobilized pectinase. The results were proved by fluorescence spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. This system proves that the activity of immobilized enzyme can be tailored predictably. and this pH-responsive polymer holds great potential for controllable delivery of enzymes.

32,Aims: We investigated the mechanism(s) by which valsartan. a selective antagonist of angiotensin subtype 1 (AT(1)) receptor. decreased plasma glucose in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Methods: The plasma glucose concentration was assessed by the glucose oxidase method. The concentration of beta-endorphin in plasma or medium incubating adrenal medulla was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA levels of the subtype 4 form of glucose transporter (GLUT4) in soleus muscle and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in the liver were detected by Northern blotting analysis. while the protein levels of GLUT4 in isolated soleus muscle and hepatic PEPCK were investigated using Western blotting analysis. Results: A single intravenous injection of valsartan dose-dependently increased plasma beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (BER) in parallel with the lowering of plasma glucose concentration in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Naloxone and naloxonazine inhibited the plasma glucose-lowering action of valsartan at doses sufficient to block opioid mu-receptors. In contrast to its action in wild-type diabetic mice. valsartan failed to modify plasma glucose in opioid mu-receptor knockout diabetic mice. Bilateral adrenalectomy in STZ-induced diabetic rats eliminated both the plasma glucose-lowering action and the plasma BER-elevating action of valsartan. In the isolated adrenal medulla of STZ-induced diabetic rats. angiotensin II (Ang II) or valsartan did not affect spontaneous BER secretion. Activation of cholinergic receptors by 1.0 mu mol/l acetylcholine (ACh) enhanced BER secretion from the isolated adrenal medulla of STZ-induced diabetic rats. but not in the presence of 1.0 nmol/l Ang II. while valsartan reversed this inhibition by Ang II in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment of STZ-induced diabetic rats with valsartan (0.2 mg/kg) three times daily for 3 days resulted in an increase in gene expression of GLUT4 in soleus muscle and impeded the reduction of elevated mRNA or protein level of hepatic PEPCK. Both of these effects were blocked by opioid mu-receptor antagonist. Conclusions: The results suggest that blockade of AT(1) receptor by valsartan may enhance the adrenal beta-endorphin secretion induced by ACh. activating the opioid mu-receptors to increase glucose utilization and/or to decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis. resulting in the reduction of plasma glucose in STZ-induced diabetic rats....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Diabetes
33,Endonuclease cleavage is the rate-limiting step in the decay of nonsense-containing human beta-globin mRNA in erythroid cells. The 5'-truncated intermediates thus generated are polyadenylated and more stable than the parent mRNA. Northern blotting is commonly used to measure the decay rate of full-length mRNA. and S1 nuclease protection is used to assay the fate of decay intermediates. We have adapted the more sensitive and facile MBRACE assay (Lasham et al.. Nucleic Acids Res 38: e19. 2010) to quantitatively monitor the decay process by detecting full-length beta-globin and its decay intermediates....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Northern blotting
34,Objective: Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HM beta) is a metabolite of leucine widely used for improving sports performance. Although limp is recognized to promote anabolic or anti-catabolic effects on protein metabolism. the impact of its long-term use on skeletal muscle and/or genes that control the skeletal protein balance is not fully known. This study aimed to investigate whether chronic HM beta treatment affects the activity of GH/IGF-I axis and skeletal muscle IGF-I and myostatin mRNA expression. Design: Rats were treated with HK beta (320 mg/kg BW) or vehicle. by gavage. for 4 weeks. and killed by decapitation. Blood was collected for evaluation of serum insulin. glucose and IGF-I concentrations. Samples of pituitary. liver. extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles were collected for total RNA or protein extraction to evaluate the expression of pituitary growth hormone (GH) gene (mRNA and protein). hepatic insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) mRNA. skeletal muscle IGF-I and myostatin mRNA by Northern blotting/real time-PCR. or Western blotting. Results: Chronic HM beta treatment increased the content of pituitary GH mRNA and GH. hepatic IGF-I mRNA and serum IGF-I concentration. No changes were detected on skeletal muscle IGF-I and myostatin mRNA expression. However. the HIM-treated rats although normoglycemic. exhibited hyperinsulinemia. Conclusions: The data presented herein extend the body of evidence on the potential role of HM beta-treatment in stimulating GH/IGF-I axis activity. In spite of this effect. HM beta supplementation also induces an apparent insulin resistance state which might limit the beneficial aspects of the former results. at least in rats under normal nutritional status and health conditions.

35,Although large numbers of long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs) expressed in the mammalian nervous system have been detected. their functions and mechanisms of regulation remain to be fully clarified. It has been reported that the IncRNA antisense transcript for beta-secretase-1 (BACE1-AS) is elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and drives the rapid feed-forward regulation of p-secretase. suggesting that it is critical in AD development. In the present study. the senile plaque (SP) AD SH-SY5Y cell model was established using the synthetic amyloid beta-protein (A beta) 1-42 in vitro. Using this model. the potential of siRNA-mediated silencing of IncRNA BACE1-AS expression to attenuate the ability of beta-secretase-1 (BACE1) to cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) and to reduce the production of A beta(1-42) oligomers was investigated. MTT assays demonstrated that exogenous A beta(1-42) suppressed SH-SY5Y cell proliferation and induced APP-related factor expression and SP formation: Furthermore. quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis revealed that the mRNA and protein expression of A beta(1-42) and A beta(1-40) was significantly increased in the AD model group. with a marked decrease in Ki-67 expression at day six. RNase protection assays (RPA) and northern blotting analysis confirmed that exogenous A beta(1-42) not only promoted the expression of the APP-cleaving enzyme BACE1. but also induced IncRNA BACE1-AS expression. Furthermore. IncRNA BACE1-AS formed RNA duplexes and increased the stability of BACE1 mRNA. Downregulation of IncRNA BACE1-AS expression in SH-SY5Y cells by siRNA silencing resulted in the attenuation of the ability of BACE1 to cleave APP and delayed the induction of SP formation in the SP AD SH-SY5Y cell model....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Alzheimer's Disease
36,Recently. we discovered that beta-thujaplicin (BT) induces metallothionein (MT) expression in mouse ker- atinocytes. both in vivo and in vitro. However. the molecular mechanisms by which BT exerts its biological effects have not been elucidated. The purpose of this study is to explore the signal transduction pathway involved in the MT mRNA induction by BT. Using a HaCaT keratinocyte cell line. Northern blotting was performed for analyzing the human MT-IIA mRNA expression levels in combination with BT and a number of protein kinase (PK) in hibitors including H7. HA1004 and a PKC-specific inhibitor chelerythrin. CAT assays with the MT-IIA gene promorter-CAT construct were conducted for examining the transcriptional regulation by BT of MT. A free radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was used for analyzing a role of oxidative stress for the MT gene induction by BT. BT increased MT-IIA gene transcript levels and CAT activity in a dose-dependent fashion in HaCaT cells. The increase in MT-IIA mRNA levels and CAT activity were completely suppressed by H7 but not by HA1004. In addition. chelerythrin prevented BT-inducible MT-IIA promoter activation. Furthermore. NAC suppressed BT4 inducible MT-IIA promoter activation. These results demonstrate that BT is a potent activator of the MT-IIA gene promoter and that PKC activation and reactive oxygen species are implicated in BT-inducible MT-IIA gene expression. BT may be a useful tool for dissecting the signal transduction pathway mediating MT-IIA promoter activation....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Human Metabolism
37,BackgroundRetinoblastoma is the most common malignant cancer of the eye in children. Although metastatic retinoblastoma is rare. cure rates for this advanced disease remain below 50%. High-level polo-like kinase 1 expression in retinoblastomas has previously been shown to be correlated with adverse outcome parameters. Polo-like kinase 1 is a serine/threonine kinase involved in cell cycle regulation at the G2/M transition. Polo-like kinase 1 inhibition has been demonstrated to have anti-tumour effects in preclinical models of several paediatric tumours. Here. we assessed its efficacy against retinoblastoma cell lines. MethodsExpression of polo-like kinase 1 was determined in a panel of retinoblastoma cell lines by polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. We analysed viability (3-(4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT assay). proliferation (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). cell cycle progression (propidium iodid staining) and apoptosis (cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in three retinoblastoma cell lines after treatment with two adenosine triphosphate-competitive polo-like kinase 1 inhibitors. BI6727 or GSK461364. Activation of polo-like kinase 1 downstream signalling components including TP53 were assessed. ResultsTreatment of retinoblastoma cells with either BI6727 or GSK461364 reduced cell viability and proliferative capacity and induced both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Polo-like kinase 1 inhibition also induced the p53 signalling pathway. Analysis of key players in cell cycle control revealed that low nanomolar concentrations of either polo-like kinase 1 inhibitor upregulated cyclin B1 and increased activated cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (phosphorylated at Y15) in retinoblastoma cell lines. ConclusionsThese preclinical data indicate that polo-like kinase 1 inhibitors could be useful as components in rationally designed chemotherapy protocols to treat patients with metastasized retinoblastoma in early phase clinical trials....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
38,The paper aims to determine the day-ahead market bidding strategies for retailers with flexible demands to maximize the short-term profit. It proposes a short-term planning framework to forecast the load under dynamic tariffs and construct biding curves. Stochastic programming is applied to manage the uncertainties of spot price. regulating price. consumption behaviors. and responsiveness to dynamic tariffs. A case study based on data from Sweden is carried out. It demonstrates that a real-time selling price can affect the aggregate load of a residential consumer group and lead to load shift toward low-price periods. The optimal bidding curves for specific trading periods are illustrated. Through comparing the bidding strategies under different risk factors. the case study shows that a risk-averse retailer tends to adopt the strategies with larger imbalances. The benefit lies in the reduction of low-profit risk. However. the aversion to risk can only be kept in a certain level. A larger imbalance may lead to a quick reduction of profit in all scenarios....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electricity
39,This paper presents a new approach for determining the day-ahead bidding strategies of a large-scale hybrid electric energy company. The company has both energy generation and energy retailing businesses in a competitive electricity market. Demand response programs are also considered in the retail side of the company in order to hedge the risk of participation in wholesale market. This paper introduces a max-min bilevel mathematical programming with equilibrium constraint model for offering a strategy that manages the risk of uncertain forecasted rivals' bids by robust optimization. The max-min bilevel model is converted to its equivalent single-level optimization using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions. The duality theory is utilized to find the equivalent ordinary maximization model of the max-min problem. Strong duality theory and big M method are also used to linearize the final model of offering strategy. Applicability of the proposed approach is shown by implementing it on the IEEE 118-bus test system....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electrical network
40,This paper presents a novel interleaved high-conversion-ratio bidirectional dc-dc converter based on switched capacitors and coupled inductors. Series-connected switched capacitor and inductor cells were used to increase the voltage conversion ratio. reduce voltage stresses on power switches. realize soft-charging/discharging of switched capacitors. and achieve autocurrent-sharing in parallel inductors. The interleaved structure combined with switched capacitors was adopted to reduce current ripple at the side having lower voltage. thus enabling applications that require high power levels. In this paper. we first review the status of high-voltage-ratio bidirectional dc-dc converters. Then. the evolution of the proposed extensible topologies and the steady-state operating principle under the inductor current continuous conduction mode is presented. Finally. the performance and features such as voltage gain. voltage and current stress. and the autocurrent-sharing mechanism that are realized by switched capacitors are verified; the optimal design of coupled-inductors. switched-capacitors. and the chip size of switches are given. A specific design of the driving circuit that facilitates actual applications is described. A 1-kW prototype converter. employing a hybrid configuration of SiC and Si MOSFETs. was constructed to verify the theoretical analysis. and achieved an optimal compromise between conversion efficiency and low cost....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Electrical circuits
41,The two-stage 48 V-12 V-1.8 V voltage regulator module (VRM) structure is gaining more and more attention in high-end server applications. The LLC converter is the preferred choice for the first conversion stage because it provides the isolated 12-V output efficiently. which is then converted to 1.8 V by the multi-phase Buck converter. Since the CPU works in sleep-mode most of the time. the light-load efficiency is very important for energy saving. This paper proposes to change the primary side of the LLC converter from the full-bridge (FB) configuration into the half-bridge (HB) configuration dynamically in the light-load condition. so that the output of the LLC dc transformer (DCX) can be changed from 12 to 6 V. This will increase the overall light-load efficiency significantly due to the reduced core loss of the LLC DCX and the reduced switching loss of the multiphase Buck converter. To achieve a fast transition of the bus voltage between 12 and 6 V. the capacitance for the intermediate bus is properly selected and the optimal trajectory control for transition between the FB configuration and HB configuration is proposed. A high-efficiency high-density 48-12 /6 V LLC DCX is designed. and experiments on the two-stage VRM demonstrate that there is a fast transient response and a more than 10% light-load efficiency improvement....,Psychology,ECE,Attention,Single-phase electric power
42,This paper proposes a bidirectional three-level LLC resonant converter with a new pulse width and amplitude modulation control method. With different control signals. it has three different operation modes with different voltage gains. Therefore. it can achieve wide voltage gain range by switching among these three modes. which is attractive for energy storage system applications needing wide voltage variation. The proposed topology operates with constant switching frequency. which is easy to implement with digital control. and it can achieve soft switching for all the switches and diodes in the circuit as a conventional LLC resonant converter. The performance of the proposed converter is validated by the experimental results from a 1-kW prototype with 20 A maximum output current....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Single-phase electric power
43,Bifenthrin (BF) is a chiral pesticide with two enantiomers. In this work. its stereoselective degradation was investigated in plants and domesticated active sludge. Considering that the degradation to pesticides of plants was effected by external conditions. hence. nanometer materials (gothite) were added into soil to explore the effect of sorption on enantioselectivity in degradation of BF. The microbial community that was responsible for BF-biodegrading in active sludge was studied by polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). In plant researches. chiral difference was discovered in the degradation of pesticides that onions resulted in. The existence of gothite in soil not only reduced the amount of BF that plants uptake from the environment. but it also enlarged the chiral difference during the process. indicating that the absorption of gothite to pesticides had enantioselectivity. which may be generated by that adsorption site where BF combined with gothite located in the chiral center of the pesticide. In studies of sludge. BF can be effectively degraded and decline of both isomers followed first-order kinetics. However. there was no obvious stereoselective degradation in domesticated sludge. The analysis of DGGE revealed that active sludge maintained the rich microbial community in the whole process (H >3). The H index increased in the early domestication. which may because BF had no direct toxicity to the bacteria. The bacteria were able to degrade the small dose of the pesticide and absorbed it as nutrition. The sequence results demonstrated that the variety of bacteria grew. instead of Acidobacteria.

46,Efficiency in a light load dc-dc converter is improved by reducing the switching frequency with the load current. Further. a bifrequency operation (BFO) using pulse train (PT) control can achieve spread spectrum. Using discrete-time models. this paper shows that a stable periodic BFO is generally not achievable in existing PT control methods. Thereafter. a unified multimode digital control technique is proposed. in which a voltage-mode digital pulse-width-modulator (DPWM) is used to control a predefined periodic BFO. Beside the fixed-frequency DPWM. an extra multiplexer is considered for real-time configuration to: 1) bifrequency pulse frequency modulation; 2) PT control; or 3) pulse regulation control; or 4) pulse skipping control with smooth transition. Analysis and design methods are discussed to ensure periodic BFO and to customize the power spectrum with predictable ripple parameters. A buck converter prototype is made. and the proposed control is implemented using an FPGA device....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
47,In order to find new insect resistance genes. four homologous cDNAs. hta-a. hta-b. hta-c and hta-d with lengths of 775. 718. 784 and 752 bp. respectively (GenBank accession numbers AF477031-AF477034). were isolated from a tuber cDNA expression library of Helianthus tuberosus L. Sequence analysis revealed that all four cDNAs contain an open reading frame of 444 bp. coding a polypeptide of 147 amino acid residues. and that the sequences of the cDNAs are very similar to those of the mannose-binding agglutinin genes of the jacalin-related family. In hemagglutination reactions and hapten inhibition assays. affinity-purified HTA (Helianthus tuberosus agglutinin) from induced Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) expressing GST-HTA shows hemagglutination ability and a higher carbohydrate-binding ability for mannose than other tested sugars. Trypsin inhibitory activity was detected in the crude extracts of induced E. coli BL21(DE3) expressing HTA. and was further verified by trypsin inhibitory activity staining on native polyacrylamide gel. The mechanism of interaction between HTA and trypsin was studied by molecular modeling. We found that plenty of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions can be formed between the supposed binding sites of HTA-b and the active site of trypsin. and that a stable HTA/trypsin complex can be formed. The results above imply that HTA might be a bifunctional protein with carbohydrate-binding activity and trypsin inhibitory activity. Moreover. Northern blotting analysis demonstrated that hta is predominantly expressed in tubers of H. tuberosus. very weakly expressed in stems. but not expressed at all in other tissues. Southern blotting analysis indicated that hta is encoded by a multi-gene family. The insect resistance traits have been described in another paper....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Immunology
48,DC distribution power systems are vulnerable to instability because of the destabilizing effect of converter-controlled constant power loads (CPLs) and input filters. Standard stability analysis tools based on averaging linearization techniques can be used only when the switching frequency of the converter is significantly higher than the cutoff frequency of the filter. However. dc distribution systems with a reduced size filter. and consequently a high cutoff frequency. are common in transportation applications. Conventional methods fail to detect instabilities in the system because they do not take into account the switching effect. To overcome this drawback. this paper proposes a discrete-time method to analyze the stability of dc distribution systems. This model is applied here to a dc power system with a CPL. The switching effects and the nonlinearities of the system model are taken into account with a simple discretization approach. The proposed method is able to predict the dynamic properties of the system. such as slow-scale and fast-scale instabilities. An active stabilizer is also included in the system model in order to extend the stability margin of the system. Finally. these observations are validated experimentally on a laboratory test bench....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Control engineering
49,We report a five-component autonomous chaotic oscillator of jerky type. hitherto the simplest of its kind. using only one operational amplifier. The key component of the circuit is a junction field-effect transistor operating in its triode region. which provides a nonlinear resistor of antisymmetrical current-voltage characteristic. emulating a Colpitts-like chaotic circuit. We describe the experimental results illustrating the dynamical behavior of the circuit. In addition. we report numerical simulations of a model of the circuit which display good agreement with our measurements....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Electrical circuits
50,Smart meters play vital roles in the aspects of the management and operation of smart grids such as demand response. energy efficiency improvement. and electricity pricing. Massive amounts of data are being collected owing to the popularity of smart meters. Two main issues should be addressed in this context. One is the communication and storage of big data from smart meters at reduced cost. The other is the effective extraction of useful information from this massive dataset. In this paper. the K-SVD sparse representation technique. which includes two phases (dictionary learning and sparse coding). is used to decompose load profiles into linear combinations of several partial usage patterns (PUPs). which allows the smart meter data to be compressed and hidden electricity consumption patterns to be extracted. Then. a linear support vector machine (SVM) based method is used to classify the load profiles into two groups. residential customers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). based on the extracted patterns. Comprehensive comparisons with the results of k-means clustering. the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). principal component analysis (PCA). and piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA) are conducted on real datasets in Ireland. The results show that our proposed technique outperforms these methods in both compression ratio and classification accuracy....,ECE,CS,Electricity,Machine learning
51,Precision medicine is a new strategy that aims at preventing and treating human diseases by focusing on individual variations in people's genes. environment and lifestyle. Precision medicine has been used for cancer diagnosis and treatment and shows evident clinical efficacy. Rapid developments in molecular biology. genetics and sequencing technologies. as well as computational technology. has enabled the establishment of "big data". such as the Human Genome Project. which provides a basis for precision medicine. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an aggressive cancer with a high incidence rate and low survival rate. Current therapies are often aggressive and carry considerable side effects. Much research now indicates that precision medicine can be used for HNSCC and may achieve improved results. From this perspective. we present an overview of the current status. potential strategies. and challenges of precision medicine in HNSCC. We focus on targeted therapy based on cell the surface signaling receptors epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). and on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR. JAK/STAT3 and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cellular signaling pathways. Gene therapy for the treatment of HNSCC is also discussed....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
52,Disease has an effect on crop yields. causing significant losses. As the worldwide demand for agricultural products increases. there is a need to pursue the development of new methods to protect crops from disease. One mechanism of plant protection is through the activation of the plant immune system. By exogenous application. 'plant activator molecules' with elicitor properties can be used to activate the plant immune system. These defence-inducing molecules represent a powerful and often environmentally friendly tool to fight pathogens. We show that the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA) induces defence in Arabidopsis and reduces the proliferation of two bacterial phytopathogens: Erwinia amylovora and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. We describe the global defence response triggered by this new plant activator in Arabidopsis at the transcriptional level. Several induced genes were selected for further analysis by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We describe the kinetics of their induction and show that abiotic stress. such as moderate drought or nitrogen limitation. does not impede DCA induction of defence. Finally. we investigate the role in the activation of defence by this bile acid of the salicylic acid biosynthesis gene SID2. of the receptor-like kinase family genes WAK1-3 and of the NADPH oxidase-encoding RbohD gene. Altogether. we show that DCA constitutes a promising molecule for plant protection which can induce complementary lines of defence. such as callose deposition. reactive oxygen species accumulation and the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signalling pathways....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Immunology
53,Accumulation of hydrophobic bile acids in the liver contributes to cholestatic liver injury. Inflammation induced by excessive bile acids is believed to play a crucial role. however. the mechanisms of bile acids triggered inflammatory response remain unclear. Recent studies have highlighted the effect of NLRP3 inflammasome in mediating liver inflammation and fibrosis. In this study. we for the first time showed that chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). the major hydrophobic primary bile acid involved in cholestatic liver injury. could dose-dependently induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine-IL-1 beta in macrophages by promoting ROS production and K+ efflux. Mechanistically. CDCA triggered ROS formation in part through TGR5/EGFR downstream signaling. including protein kinase B. extracellular regulated protein kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways. Meanwhile. CDCA also induced ATP release from macrophages which subsequently causes K+ efflux via P2X7 receptor. Furthermore. in vivo inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with caspase-1 inhibitor dramatically decreased mature IL-1 beta level of liver tissue and ameliorated liver fibrosis in bile duct ligation (BDL) mouse model. In conclusion. excessive CDCA may represent an endogenous danger signal to activate NLRP3 inflammasome and initiate liver inflammation during cholestasis. Our finding offers a mechanistic basis to ameliorate cholestatic liver fibrosis by targeting inflammasome activation....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Digestive Health
54,Worldwide natural gas consumption has increased significantly. especially for power generation in electricity systems with the gas-to-power (G2P) process of natural gas fired units. Supply for both natural gas and electricity systems should be dispatched economically and simultaneously due to their firm interconnection. This paper proposes a security-constrained bi-level economic dispatch (ED) model for integrated natural gas and electricity systems considering wind power and power-to-gas (P2G) process. The upper level is formulated as an ED optimization model for electricity system. while the lower level is an optimal allocation problem for natural gas system. Natural gas system is modeled in detail. In addition. the security constraints and coupling constraints for the integrated energy systems are considered. The objective function is to minimize the total production cost of electricity and natural gas. The lower model is converted and added into the upper model as Karush-Kuhn-Tucher (KKT) optimality conditions. thus the bi-level optimization model is transformed into a mix-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. Numerical case studies on the PJM-5bus system integrated with a seven-node gas system and IEEE 118-bus system integrated with a modified Belgian high-calorific gas system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bi-level ED model.

55,This paper describes a variable output voltage. multi-phase switched capacitor step-up DC-DC converter with a digital voltage regulation scheme. implemented in CMOS VLSI technology. The number of conversion ratios generated using n flying capacitors is of the order of 2(n). A scheme for selection of switch is presented. Expressions for equivalent series resistance (Req). conduction. switching power loss and efficiency are obtained and compared with the cadence spectre simulation results. The step-up open loop converter circuit for one of the gain is described and analysed by varying the switching frequency. An open loop converter efficiency of about 78% is achieved with 4% bottom plate parasitic capacitance for a load current of 1 mA and input voltage of 0.6 V at 4 MHz of switching frequency for a gain of 4/3. The voltage regulation scheme for a desired output voltage is designed with a digital control circuit using inherent capacitive DAC which can interpolate through various gain configuration for n = 2 flying capacitor and is simulated in Cadence Analog-Mixed Signal Flow using 180nm CMOS technology. The layout design using MIM cap has been done and back annotation results are presented....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
56,Destination memory refers to the ability to remember to whom a piece of information was previously transmitted. Our paper assessed this ability in schizophrenia. Twenty-five patients with schizophrenia and 25 control participants told proverbs (e.g.. "send a thief to catch a thief") to pictures of celebrities (e.g.. Elvis Presley). Afterward. participants had to indicate to which celebrity they had previously said the proverbs. Participants also completed a binding task in which they were required to associate letters with their corresponding context (i.e.. location). Analysis revealed worse destination memory and binding in patients with schizophrenia than in controls. In both populations. destination memory was significantly correlated with performances on the binding task. Our findings suggest difficulty in the ability to attribute information to its appropriate destination in schizophrenia. This difficulty may be related to compromise in binding separate cues together to form a coherent representation of an event in memory....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Schizophrenia
57,Background: A 12-month. open-label extension study assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) in adults with binge eating disorder (BED). Methods: Adults (aged 18-55 y) with BED who completed 1 of 3 antecedent studies were enrolled in a 52-week. open-label extension study (dose optimization. 4 weeks [initial titration dose. 30-mg LDX; target doses. 50-or 70-mg LDX]; dose maintenance. 48 weeks). Safety evaluations included the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). vital sign and weight assessments. and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale responses. Results: Of the 604 enrolled participants. 599 (521 women and 78 men) comprised the safety analysis set. and 369 completed the study. Mean (SD) LDX exposure was 284.3 (118.84) days; cumulative LDX exposure duration was 12 months or longer in 344 participants (57.4%). A total of 506 participants (84.5%) reported TEAEs (TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation. 54 [9.0%]; severe TEAEs. 42 [7.0%]; serious TEAEs. 17 [2.8%]). Treatment-emergent adverse events reported in greater than or equal to 10% of participants were dry mouth (27.2%). headache (13.2%). insomnia (12.4%). and upper respiratory tract infection (11.4%). Mean (SD) changes from antecedent study baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. pulse. and weight at week 52/early termination (n = 597) were 2.19 (11.043) and 1.77 (7.848) mm Hg. 6.58 (10.572) beats per minute. and -7.04 (7.534) kg. respectively. On the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. there were 2 positive responses for any active suicidal ideations; there were no positive responses for suicidal behavior or completed suicides. Conclusions: In this 12-month. open-label. extension study. the long-term safety and tolerability of LDX in adults with BED were generally consistent with its established profile for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder....,Psychology,Medical,Attention,Addiction
58,ObjectiveThis study aims to evaluate the theory of mind ability in a sample of obese patients with and without binge eating disorder (BED) and to explore the correlations between emotional and clinical assessments. MethodsOverall. 20 non-BED. 16 under-threshold BED and 22 BED obese patients completed a battery of tests assessing social cognition and eating disorder psychopathology. ResultsBinge eating disorder. non-BED and under-threshold-BED obese patients showed similar ability to recognise others' emotions. but BED obese patients exhibited a deficit in recognising their own emotions as demonstrated by more impaired levels of alexithymia and interoceptive awareness and were more depressed. High positive correlations were evident between binging. depression. interoceptive awareness and alexithymia. ConclusionsBinge eating disorder patients have a comparable ability to understand others' emotions but a more impaired capacity to understand and code their own emotions compared with non-BED obese patients. This impairment is highly correlated with depression. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons. Ltd and Eating Disorders Association....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Eating disorders
59,This study presents a bioacoustic sensor system developed for early detection of the recovery of bowel activity after abdominal surgery and to perform analysis on bowel sounds. Different than other studies. in order to be able to attenuate noise. two capacitive microphones oriented in opposite directions are used. Bowel sounds are typically observed at a frequency between 100 Hz and 1500 Hz and amplitude between 0 and 20mV. The signal strength is boosted 48 times with an amplifying circuit. The second microphone is used to observe environmental noise such as examination room noise. Both signals are digitized using an ADC (NI DAQ Data Acquisition USB 6009).

60,Reclamation of wastewater (WW) for irrigation. after treatment represents a challenge that could alleviate pressure on water resources and address the increasing demand for agriculture. However. the risks to human health must be assessed. particularly those related to human enteric viruses that resist standard treatments in most wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The risks associated with exposure to viral bioaerosols near WWTP and near agricultural plots irrigated with WW are poorly documented. The objectives of this study were to 1) better characterize human enteric viruses found in bioaerosols near a "standardWWTP" and over fields irrigated with treated WW and 2) propose a numeric model to assess the health risk to populations located close to the irrigated areas. with particular attention to norovirus. which is responsible for most viral gastroenteritis in France. Water and air samples were collected at various locations in the largest French WW-irrigated site near Clermont-Ferrand. at the WWTP entrance and after treatment. in the air above activated sludge basins. and above fields irrigated with WW. Various enteric viruses were found in the water samples collected both before and after treatment. Norovirus was the most abundant with >10e4 genome copies/l (GC/L) before treatment and similar to 10e3 GC/L after treatment. Low quantities (= 3 m/s) and a constant emission rate of 8e3 GC/m(3)/s. This probability decreases by 3 log when the distance to the emission source is doubled. This information can aid development of safe water reuse policies in terms of local setback distance and wind conditions for wastewater reuse. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

61,Synergistic effects of multiple plant secondary metabolites on upper trophic levels constitute an underexplored but potentially widespread component of coevolution and ecological interactions. Examples of plant secondary metabolites acting synergistically as insect deterrents are not common. and many studies focus on the pharmaceutical applications of natural products. where activity is serendipitous and not an evolved response. This review summarizes some systems that are ideal for testing synergistic plant defenses and utilizes a focused meta-analysis to examine studies that have tested effects of multiple compounds on insects. Due to a dearth of ecological synergy studies. one of the few patterns for synergy that we are able to report from the meta-analysis is that phytochemical mixtures have a larger overall effect on generalist herbivores than specialist herbivores. We recommend a focus on synergy in chemical ecology programs and suggest future hypothesis tests and methods. These approaches are not focused on techniques in molecular biology to examine mechanisms at the cellular level. rather we recommend uncovering the existence of synergy first. by combining the best methods in organic synthesis. isolation. chemical ecology. bioassays. and quantitative analyses. Data generated by our recommended methods should provide rigorous tests of important hypotheses on how intraclass and interclass compounds act synergistically to deter insects. disrupt the immune response. and ultimately contribute to diversification. Further synergy research should also contribute to determining if antiherbivore synergy is widespread among plant secondary metabolites. which would be consistent with the hypothesis that synergistic defenses are a key attribute of the evolved diverse chemical mixtures found in plants....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Immunology
62,The l-alanine dehydrogenase of Bacillus subtilis (BasAlaDH). which is strictly dependent on NADH as redox cofactor. efficiently catalyzes the reductive amination of pyruvate to l-alanine using ammonia as amino group donor. To enable application of BasAlaDH as regenerating enzyme in coupled reactions with NADPH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases. we alterated its cofactor specificity from NADH to NADPH via protein engineering. By introducing two amino acid exchanges. D196A and L197R. high catalytic efficiency for NADPH was achieved. with k(cat)/K-M=54.1 mu M(-1)Min(-1) (K-M=32 +/- 3 mu M; k(cat)=1.730 +/- 39Min(-1)). almost the same as the wild-type enzyme for NADH (k(cat)/K-M=59.9 mu M(-1)Min(-1); K-M=14 +/- 2 mu M; k(cat)=838 +/- 21Min(-1)). Conversely. recognition of NADH was much diminished in the mutated enzyme (k(cat)/K-M=3 mu M(-1)Min(-1)). BasAlaDH(D196A/L197R) was applied in a coupled oxidation/transamination reaction of the chiral dicyclic dialcohol isosorbide to its diamines. catalyzed by Ralstonia sp. alcohol dehydrogenase and Paracoccus denitrificans -aminotransferase. thus allowing recycling of the two cosubstrates NADP(+) and l-Ala. An excellent cofactor regeneration with recycling factors of 33 for NADP(+) and 13 for l-Ala was observed with the engineered BasAlaDH in a small-scale biocatalysis experiment. This opens a biocatalytic route to novel building blocks for industrial high-performance polymers. (C) 2015 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

63,Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is an indispensable tool in the fields of epigenetics and gene regulation that isolates specific protein-DNA interactions. ChIP coupled to high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is commonly used to determine the genomic location of proteins that interact with chromatin. However. ChIP-seq is hampered by relatively low mapping resolution of several hundred base pairs and high background signal. The ChIP-exo method is a refined version of ChIP-seq that substantially improves upon both resolution and noise. The key distinction of the ChIP-exo methodology is the incorporation of lambda exonuclease digestion in the library preparation workflow to effectively footprint the left and right 5 ' DNA borders of the protein-DNA crosslink site. The ChIP-exo libraries are then subjected to high throughput sequencing. The resulting data can be leveraged to provide unique and ultra-high resolution insights into the functional organization of the genome. Here. we describe the ChIP-exo method that we have optimized and streamlined for mammalian systems and next-generation sequencing-by-synthesis platform....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,DNA/RNA sequencing
64,N-6-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) modifications of RNA are diverse and ubiquitous amongst eukaryotes. They occur in mRNA. rRNA. tRNA. and microRNA. Recent studies have revealed that these reversible RNA modifications affect RNA splicing. translation. degradation. and localization. Multiple physiological processes. like circadian rhythms. stem cell pluripotency. fibrosis. triglyceride metabolism. and obesity are also controlled by m(6)A modifications. Immunoprecipitation/sequencing. mass spectrometry. and modified northern blotting are some of the methods commonly employed to measure m(6)A modifications. Herein. we present a northeastern blotting technique for measuring m6A modifications. The current protocol provides good size separation of RNA. better accommodation and standardization for various experimental designs. and clear delineation of m(6)A modifications in various sources of RNA. While m(6)A modifications are known to have a crucial impact on human physiology relating to circadian rhythms and obesity. their roles in other (patho) physiological states are unclear. Therefore. investigations on m6A modifications have immense possibility to provide key insights into molecular physiology....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Northern blotting
65,Considerable effort has recently been directed toward the implementation of molecular bioassays on digital-microfluidic biochips (DMFBs). However. today's solutions suffer from the drawback that multiple sample pathways are not supported and on-chip reconfigurable devices are not efficiently exploited. As a result. impractical manual intervention is needed to process protocols for gene-expression analysis. To overcome this problem. we first describe our benchtop experimental studies to understand gene-expression analysis and its relationship to the biochip design specification. We then introduce an integrated framework for quantitative gene-expression analysis using DMFBs. The proposed framework includes: 1) a spatial-reconfiguration technique that incorporates resource-sharing specifications into the synthesis flow; 2) an interactive firmware that collects and analyzes sensor data based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction; and 3) a real-time resource-allocation scheme that responds promptly to decisions about the protocol flow received from the firmware layer. This framework is combined with cyberphysical integration to develop the first design-automation framework for quantitative gene expression. Simulation results show that our adaptive framework efficiently utilizes on-chip resources to reduce time-to-result without sacrificing the chip's lifetime....,biochemistry,ECE,Polymerase chain reaction,Satellite radio

67,Biochemical analysis of biological substances found at a crime scene is an important aspect of forensic investigations. where the objective is to determine the identification of crime victims and suspects/persons-of-interest. One particular biochemistry/molecular biology-based area of interest in forensic analysis is forensic serology; this area focuses on the complex task of gathering information regarding the type. age. ethnicity. and/or gender of the sample originator from the biological fluids (blood. saliva. etc.) found at a crime scene. In this review. we cover various studies involving biocomputing techniques used for the analysis of biological samples namely blood - in different forensic applications. The studies covered include the differentiation of gender and ethnicity using a biocomputing system that produces a binary result. as well as the determination of blood spot age. Each of the applications showcased in this review produces sometimes ambiguous results that would normally pose major problems for a study. however. the addition of biocomputing logic provides an extra level of certainty and clarity.

68,Adverse social conditions in early life have been linked to increased expression of proinflammatory genes and reduced expression of antiviral genes in circulating immune cells-the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA). However. it remains unclear whether such effects are specific to the Western. educated. industrialized. rich. and democratic (WEIRD) cultural environments in which previous research has been conducted. To assess the roles of early adversity and individual psychological resilience in immune system gene regulation within a non-WEIRD population. we evaluated CTRA gene-expression profiles in 254 former child soldiers and matched noncombatant civilians 5 y after the People's War in Nepal. CTRA gene expression was up-regulated in former child soldiers. These effects were linked to the degree of experienced trauma and associated distress-that is. posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity-more than to child soldier status per se. Self-perceived psychological resilience was associated with marked buffering of CTRA activation such that PTSD-affected former child soldiers with high levels of personal resilience showed molecular profiles comparable to those of PTSD-free civilians. These results suggest that CTRA responses to early life adversity are not restricted to WEIRD cultural contexts and they underscore the key role of resilience in determining the molecular impact of adverse environments....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Stress Management
69,In recent years. there has been increasing concern over public health threat presented by introduction of petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants in environment due to anthropogenic activities to a greater extent and natural processes to some extent. Many countries all over the world are currently facing severe problem due to these pollutants as they are one of the persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Remediation of polluted sites by biodegradation is a viable option as conventional physico-chemical methods for remediation seems technically as well as economically challenging. Biodegradation is non-invasive and could be cost-effective in removal of petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants. It is considered as ultimate mechanism for pollutants removal. Immobilized microbial cells give advantage over free microbial cells to improve the survival and retention of the bioremediation agents in polluted sites. However. current biodegradation approaches suffer from a number of limitations. which include pollutant characteristics. poor capabilities of microbial communities in the field. lesser bioavailability of pollutants. growth conditions. etc. Understanding the factors affecting microbial degradation is of great research interest in present scenario. This review selectively examines and provides a critical view on bioavailability of the substrates. microorganisms in petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants degradation and the molecular techniques for their characterization. degradation mechanisms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. commercially available bioremediation agents and factors affecting biodegradation of these pollutants. Role of genetically modified organisms and biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants by immobilized will also be discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

70,Microbiological deterioration was observed on a historic collection of retouched glass plate negatives. The collection came from a burnt manor house that belonged to the Brandys family before World War Ilnd. The photographs were taken at the end of 19th century. The collection consists of 35 glass plate negatives. 4 of which were examined for possible presence of microorganisms. The current state of the negatives indicated that the collection may have been flooded. Initially. the viability of the microorganisms on the plates was examined using luminescence adenosine phosphate assay. The fungi were isolated and identified with molecular biology methods as Trichoderma longibrachiatum. Hypocrea Aspergillus versicolor. Penicillium sp. As the historic negatives were covered with a protective varnish layer. the impact of the isolated fungi on test negative plates covered with dammar and sandarac varnishes. and on a gelatine image layer were examined. The most effective in degradation of gelatine emulsion was T. longibrachiatum. All of the investigated microorganisms quickly decomposed silver image in gelatine layer not covered with varnish in opposite to slower decomposition of silver image in gelatine layer covered with sandarac and dammar varnishes. UV-induced luminescence observation confirmed that the microorganisms quickly decomposed gelatin layer not covered with varnish. The cracking of varnish was the result of fungal activity within gelatin. however. some fungi also attacked the varnish itself. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

During the exposure. the evolution of cement materials was monitored. After 4 years exposure. OPC materials without BFS are deeply deteriorated at high speed. Best performances have been observed with CAC mortars correlated to their higher content in aluminium ion ( Al3+). The rank of durability observed on site is OPC < OPC+BFS<CAC+BFS<CAC.

72,Humans have drastically altered the abundance of animals in marine ecosystems via exploitation. Reduced abundance can destabilize food webs. leading to cascading indirect effects that dramatically reorganize community structure and shift ecosystem function. However. the additional implications of these top-down changes for biogeochemical cycles via consumer-mediated nutrient dynamics (CND) are often overlooked in marine systems. particularly in coastal areas. Here. we review research that underscores the importance of this bottom-up control at local. regional. and global scales in coastal marine ecosystems. and the potential implications of anthropogenic change to fundamentally alter these processes. We focus attention on the two primary ways consumers affect nutrient dynamics. with emphasis on implications for the nutrient capacity of ecosystems: (1) the storage and retention of nutrients in biomass. and (2) the supply of nutrients via excretion and egestion. Nutrient storage in consumer biomass may be especially important in many marine ecosystems because consumers. as opposed to producers. often dominate organismal biomass. As for nutrient supply. we emphasize how consumers enhance primary production through both press and pulse dynamics. Looking forward. we explore the importance of CDN for improving theory (e.g.. ecological stoichiometry. metabolic theory. and biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships). all in the context of global environmental change. Increasing research focus on CND will likely transform our perspectives on how consumers affect the functioning of marine ecosystems....,Psychology,biochemistry,Attention,Cell biology

74,In the biorefinery context. thermochemical processes have attracted a significant attention in recent years. Such processes generally consist of three main steps: pretreatment. thermochemical treatment. and post-treatment. In these developing processes. drying and feeding of biomass feedstock remain a significant and costly challenge. The moisture content of biomass feedstock must be decreased to an economic level at pretreatment step otherwise it has to have a detrimental effect on the process efficiency and quality of products. This work addresses the drying of biomass feedstock using novel but practical technology. called biodrying. It is a green technology that offers an opportunity for biomass drying without using an external heat source or fossil fuels. since drying energy is generated through exothermic microbial activity in the biomass that enhances the drying rate. This paper focuses on technoeconomic assessment of continuous biodrying technology integrated to gasification-based biorefinery and investigates the conditions that make such novel technology viable in conjunction with gasification process. Fixed capital investment and operating cost of different biodrying scenarios were estimated as M$4.3-21 and M$0.85/y-3.6/y. respectively. and potential benefits (sludge landfilling cost. energy savings. and carbon credit) from integration of the continuous biodrying system in gasification process implemented in pulp and paper mill were calculated. and ultimately economic performances of the scenarios were assessed. Furthermore. the viable biodrying conditions were specified as 4-day residence time and the major viability risk was found to be bound moisture of biomass....,Psychology,biochemistry,Attention,Enzymology
75,Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) may be used to upgrade anaerobic digester biogas by directly converting CO2 to CH4. The objective of this study was to evaluate gas (N-2. CO2. CH4. and H-2) and carbon transport within a methanogenic BES. Four BES configurations were evaluated: abiotic anode with abiotic cathode (AAn-ACa). bioanode with abiotic cathode (BAn-ACa). abiotic anode with biocathode (AAn-BCa). and bioanode with biocathode (BAn-BCa). Transport of N-2. a gas commonly used for flushing anoxic systems. out of the anode headspace ranged from 3.7 to 6.2L/d-atm-m(2). normalized to the proton exchange membrane (PEM) surface area and net driving pressure (NDP). CO2 was transported from the cathode to the anode headspace at rates from 3.7 to 5.4L/d-atm-m(2). The flux of H-2 from cathode to anode headspace was 48% greater when the system had a biocathode (AAn-BCa) than when H-2 was produced at an abiotic cathode (BAn-ACa). even though the abiotic cathode headspace had 75% more H-2 than the AAn-BCa biocathode at the end of 1 day. A 7-day carbon balance of a batch-fed BAn-BCa BES showed transient microbial carbon storage and a net transport of carbon from anode to cathode. After a 7-day batch incubation. the CH4 production in the biocathode was 27% greater on a molar basis than the initial CO2 supplied to the biocathode headspace. indicating conversion of CO2 produced in the anode. This research expands the current understanding of methanogenic BES operation. which may be used in improving the assessment of BES performance and/or in the development of alternative BES designs and mathematical models.

76,In this work. the performance of dual-chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs) constructed either with commonly used Nafion (R) proton exchange membrane or supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs) was assessed. The behavior of MFCs was followed and analyzed by taking the polarization curves and besides. their efficiency was characterized by measuring the electricity generation using various substrates such as acetate and glucose. By using the SILMs containing either [C(6)mirn][PF6] or [Bmiml[NTf2] ionic liquids. the energy production of these MFCs from glucose was comparable to that obtained with the MFC employing polymeric Nafion (R) and the same substrate. Furthermore. the MFC operated with [Bmim] [NTf2]-based SILM demonstrated higher energy yield in case of low acetate loading (80.1 J g(-1) CODin m(-2) h(-1)) than the one with the polymeric Nafion N115 (59 J g(-1) CODin m(-2) h(-1)). Significant difference was observed between the two SILM-MFCs. however. the characteristics of the system was similar based on the cell polarization measurements. The results suggest that membrane-engineering applying ionic liquids can be an interesting subject field for bioelectrochemical system research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

77,Bio-electrochemical systems (BESs) are the microbial systems which are employed to produce electricity directly from organic wastes along with some valuable chemicals production such as medium chain fatty acids; acetate. butyrate and alcohols. In this review. recent updates about value-added chemicals production concomitantly with the production of gaseous fuels like hydrogen and methane which are considered as cleaner for the environment have been addressed. Additionally. the bottlenecks associated with the conversion rates. lower yields and other aspects have been mentioned. In spite of its infant stage development. this would be the future trend of energy. biochemicals and electricity production in greener and cleaner pathway with the win-win situation of organic waste remediation. Henceforth. this review intends to summarise and foster the progress made in the BESs and discusses its challenges and outlook on future research advances. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

78,Limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees C requires the transformation of the global energy system at a scale unprecedented since the industrial revolution. To meet this 2 degrees C goal. 87% of integrated assessment models opt for using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Without BECCS. the models predict that the goal will be either unachievable or substantially more costly to meet. While the modeling literature is extensive. studies of how key climate policy actors perceive and prioritize BECCS are sparse. This article provides a unique intercontinental mapping of the prioritization of BECCS for the long term transition of the electricity supply sector. Based on survey responses from 711 UN climate change conference delegates. the article reports the low prioritization of BECCS relative to alternative technologies. indicating an urgent need for studies of the sociopolitical preconditions for large-scale BECCS deployment....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Microcontroller
79,Exposure to air pollution claimed the lives of about seven million people worldwide in 2010. largely from combustion of solid biomass fuels. Bioenergy is an alternative renewable source which can mitigate a climate change. Little is known about the human health and ecosystem effects of bioenergy. mainly in the electricity sector. This research applied a life cycle assessment approach to examine the human health and ecosystem effects of four bioenergy pathways: direct combustion of wood biomass. direct combustion of forest residue. direct combustion of pellets. and biomass integrated gasification and combined cycle (BIGCC). All pathways showed some variability of impacts; therefore. no single bioenergy pathway was the best absolute option. With the exception of the slightly higher human health impact. BIGCC has the least impact for all impact categories. However. all bioenergy systems implied lower ecosystem impact but higher human health impact as compared to climate change impact. Electricity generation from wood-biomass would improve the environmental sustainability of Alberta's electricity grid system because it reduces the human health and ecosystem impacts. as compared to the existing electricity production mix of the province.

80,Coal-fired power plants produce nearly 40% of the electricity in the United States. contributing more than three-quarters of all carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity sector. While many European coal-fired power plants have been transitioning to wood pellets to abate carbon dioxide emissions. such a changeover has not occurred in the United States electricity sector. This analysis examines the environmental implications of co-firing coal and wood pellets in the Southeastern United States. where the vast majority of wood pellet exports to Europe originate. Utilizing primary data from existing wood pellet manufacturers. a life cycle inventory is presented that characterizes the full cradle-to-grave environmental performance of co-firing coal and wood pellets for electricity generation. Furthermore. the avoided life cycle emissions related to shipping wood pellets to Europe are calculated. Life cycle assessment modeling scenarios for co-firing wood pellets in existing coal-fired power plants within the Southeastern United States result in reductions in eight of nine impact categories. The results presented here indicate that co-firing with wood pellets could be a viable interim solution for the aging fleet of coal-fired power plants within the Southeastern United States. particularly if stricter emission regulations and renewable portfolio standards are implemented.

81,Substrate nanotopography has been shown to be a potent modulator of cell phenotype and function. To dissect nanotopography modulation of cell behavior. a large area of nanopatterned substrate is desirable so that enough cells can be cultured on the nanotopography for subsequent biochemical and molecular biology analyses. However. current nanofabrication techniques have limitations to generate highly defined nanopatterns over a large area. Herein. we present a method to expand nanopatterned substrates from a small. highly defined nanopattern to a large area using stitch technique. The method combines multiple techniques. involving soft lithography to replicate poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) molds from a well-defined mold. stitch technique to assemble multiple PDMS molds to a single large mold. and nanoimprinting to generate a master mold on polystyrene (PS) substrates. With the PS master mold. we produce PDMS working substrates and demonstrate nanotopographical modulation of cell spreading. This method provides a simple. affordable yet versatile avenue to generate well-defined nanopatterns over large areas. and is potentially extended to create micro-/nanoscale devices with hybrid components....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Northern blotting
82,Biofouling is a pervasive challenge in industrial and medical settings with enormous economic and health impacts. Use of quorum-quenching phages is a potential solution in either combating the biofilm or inhibiting biofilm formation when an engineered phage is designed for a specific bacterial system. In the event of a real-life application of synthetic phage. it is necessary to consider the effect of environmental conditions on the synthetic phage. This study focused on both (1) stability of phage lysate under different types of carbon sources and (2) competition of the engineered phage in comparison to a wild-type (wt) phage. Optimal results were found (in plaque forming units [PFUs]) with glucose as a carbon source and were kept stable for almost 30 days. Results suggested that competition happens before 4h. After that time. polymerase chain reaction results from PFU samples showed an increase in T7aiiA. which indicates that these conditions favored the phage replication of the engineered phage over the wt at 27h in a monoculture system. When both stability and competition were combined. the mix of phages showed a trend similar to T7aiiA only primarily after 8 days....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Polymerase chain reaction
83,Biofuels have transitioned from a technology expected to deliver numerous benefits to a highly contested socio-technical solution. Initial hopes about their potential to mitigate climate change and to deliver energy security benefits and rural development. particularly in the Global South. have unravelled in the face of numerous controversies. In recognition of the negative externalities associated with biofuels. the European Union developed sustainability criteria which are enforced by certification schemes. This paper draws on the literature on stewardship to analyse the outcomes of these schemes in two countries: the UK and Guatemala. It explores two key issues: first. how has European Union biofuels policy shaped biofuel industries in the UK and Guatemala? And second. what are the implications for sustainable land stewardship? By drawing attention to the outcomes of European demand for biofuels. we raise questions about the ability of European policy to drive sustainable land practices in these two cases. The paper concludes that. rather than promoting stewardship. the current governance framework effectively rubberstamps existing agricultural systems and serves to further embed existing inequalities....,Psychology,MAE,Attention,Fluid mechanics
84,The present research study presents the optimization of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) power plants directly fed by biogas. By considering energy and exergy balances for such a system. a detailed thermodynamic model (THERMAS) was designed and implemented. A specific SOFC-based system was selected as case study. equipped with three heat exchangers (preheaters). a reformer. a SOFC-stack system and an afterburner. The use of the simulation tool THERMAS give us the opportunity to investigate all the appropriate parameters that affect system's efficiency based on exergy analysis while incorporating a detailed parametric analysis regarding the whole system. The optimization process relies on the difference between the energy and exergy efficiency by considering an innovative Optimization Factor (OPF) for each simulated system. which is dynamically affected by operational parameters. such as fuel composition. extension of chemical reactions and temperatures. It is found that the use of a pure fuels seems to be meaningless without optimization. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electrical generator
85,Herein a techno-economic assessment was performed on an energy-crop-based biogas plant coupled with a greenhouse for utilizing thermal energy produced by cogeneration. Seven energy crops were evaluated: triticale. maize. alfalfa. sunflower. clover. barley and wheat. According to the evaluation. triticale was the most competitive energy crop under selected climate conditions for northern Greece. Although maize displays higher biomass yield and biogas potential than the drought-resistant crop triticale. it has high irrigation demand that contributes significantly to total production costs. For a triticale-based biogas production to become economically feasible. agricultural arable area larger than 500 ha. or biogas plant size larger than 1000 kW(el). is required. However. with public funding. biogas production becomes feasible at smaller area (>250 ha) or biogas plant size (>500 kW(el)). The inclusion of a greenhouse into the design of the biogas plant contributes positively to the economic viability of the entire system. Under this scenario. greenhouse financial income accounts for about 17-18% of total income. Results of a sensitivity analysis suggest that the selection of an appropriate energy crop for biogas production should be based principally on both digestibility (specific methane yield) and biomass yield per hectare. these factors being more critical than biomass production costs....,ECE,MAE,Electricity,Fluid mechanics
86,Many recent studies have reported that microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and function are related to the molecular mechanisms of various clinical diseases. Several methods. including northern blotting and DNA chip analyses. are capable of assessing miRNA-production patterns in cells. However. the development of repetitive monitoring of the miRNA-production profile in a noninvasive manner is demanded for the application of miRNAs to human medicine. Here. we describe a noninvasive system for monitoring miRNA biogenesis. from the stage of primary transcripts to that of mature miRNA regulation. We review the optical methods that have been developed to image miRNA production at each step of the miRNA-processing pathway in living subjects. We propose that an optical miRNA-imaging strategy. based on molecular imaging. can be used as an miRNA imaging detector to monitor various miRNAs. by using different reporters. simultaneously. for high-throughput screening. and will provide potential application for the diagnosis and therapeutics of multiple diseases....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Northern blotting
87,Non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the translation of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) involved in the growth and development of a variety of cells. including primordial germ cells (PGCs) which play an essential role in germ cell development. However. the target mRNAs and the regulatory networks influenced by miRNAs in PGCs remain unclear. Here. we demonstrate a novel miRNAs control PGC development through targeting mRNAs involved in various cellular pathways. We reveal the PGC-enriched expression patterns of nine miRNAs. including miR-10b. -18a. -93. -106b. -126-3p. -127. -181a. -181b. and -301. using miRNA expression analysis along with mRNA microarray analysis in PGCs. embryonic gonads. and postnatal testes. These miRNAs are highly expressed in PGCs. as demonstrated by Northern blotting. miRNA in situ hybridization assay. and miRNA qPCR analysis. This integrative study utilizing mRNA microarray analysis and miRNA target prediction demonstrates the regulatory networks through which these miRNAs regulate their potential target genes during PGC development. The elucidated networks of miRNAs disclose a coordinated molecular mechanism by which these miRNAs regulate distinct cellular pathways in PGCs that determine germ cell development....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
88,Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. F. is one of the most valuable medicinal plants because it contains a large variety of active terpenoid compounds. including triptolide. celastrol. and wilforlide. All of the pharmacologically active secondary metabolites are synthesized from the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate and mevalonate pathway in the isoprenoid biosynthetic system. The key step in this pathway is the isomerization of dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate. which is catalyzed by isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPI). In the present study. a full-length cDNA encoding IPI (designate as TwIPI. GenBank accession no. KT279355) was cloned from a suspension of cultured cells from T. wilfordii. The full-length cDNA of TwIPI was 1.564 bp and encoded a polypeptide of 288 amino acids. The bioinformatics analysis showed that the deduced TwIPI sequence contained the TNTCCSHPL and WGEHELDY motif. The transcription level of the TwIPI in the suspension cells increased almost fivefold after treatment with methyl jasmonate as an elicitor. A functional color assay in Escherichia coli indicated that TwIPI could promote the accumulation of lycopene and encoded a functional protein.

89,It is assumed that resistance to ionizing radiation. as well as cross-resistance to other abiotic stresses. is a side effect of the evolutionary-based adaptation of anhydrobiotic animals to dehydration stress. Larvae of Polypedilum vanderplanki can withstand prolonged desiccation as well as high doses of ionizing radiation exposure. For a further understanding of the mechanisms of cross-tolerance to both types of stress exposure. we profiled genome-wide mRNA expression patterns using microarray techniques on the chironomid larvae collected at different stages of desiccation and after exposure to two types of ionizing radiation-70 Gy of high-linear energy transfer (LET) ions (He-4) and the same dose of low-LET radiation (gamma rays). In expression profiles. a wide transcriptional response to desiccation stress that much exceeded the amount of up-regulated transcripts to irradiation exposure was observed. An extensive group of coincidently up-regulated overlapped transcripts in response to desiccation and ionizing radiation was found. Among this. overlapped set of transcripts was indicated anhydrobiosis-related genes: antioxidants. late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins. and heat-shock proteins. The most overexpressed group was that of protein-L-isoaspartate/D-aspartate O-methyltransferase (PIMT). while probes. corresponding to LEA proteins. were the most represented. Performed functional analysis showed strongly enriched gene ontology terms associated with protein methylation. In addition. active processes of DNA repair were detected. We assume that the cross-tolerance of the sleeping chironomid to both desiccation and irradiation exposure comes from a complex mechanism of adaptation to anhydrobiosis....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Molecular biology
90,Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA sequence data from thousands of samples are present in the public sequence databases. No publicly available. up-to-date. multiple sequence alignments. containing full-length and subgenomic fragments per genotype. are available. Such alignments are useful in many analysis applications. including data-mining and phylogenetic analyses. Results: By issuing a query. all HBV sequence data from the GenBank public database was downloaded (67.893 sequences). Full-length and subgenomic sequences. which were genotyped by the submitters (30.852 sequences). were placed into a multiple sequence alignment. for each genotype (genotype A: 5868 sequences. B: 4630. C: 7820. D: 8300. E: 2043. F: 985. G: 189. H: 108. I: 23). according to the results of offline BLAST searches against a custom reference library of full-length sequences. Further curation was performed to improve the alignment. Conclusions: The algorithm described in this paper generates. for each of the nine HBV genotypes. multiple sequence alignments. which contain full-length and subgenomic fragments. The alignments can be updated as new sequences become available in the online public sequence databases.

91,Human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) possess the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts. and they can be utilized as a source for bone regenerative therapy. Osteoinductive pretreatment. which induces the osteoblastic differentiation of hMSCs in vitro. has been widely used for bone tissue engineering prior to cell transplantation. However. the molecular basis of osteoblastic differentiation induced by osteoinductive medium (OIM) is still unknown. Therefore. we used a next-generation sequencer to investigate the changes in gene expression during the osteoblastic differentiation of hMSCs. The hMSCs used in this study possessed both multipotency and self-renewal ability. Whole-transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 (ZBTB16) was significantly increased during the osteoblastogenesis of hMSCs. ZBTB16 mRNA and protein expression was enhanced by culturing the hMSCs with OIM. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing of ZBTB16 decreased the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP); the expression of osteogenic genes. such as osteocalcin (OCN) and bone sialoprotein (BSP). and the mineralized nodule formation induced by OIM. siRNA-mediated gene silencing of Osterix (Osx). which is known as an essential regulator of osteoblastic differentiation. markedly downregulated the expression of ZBTB16. In addition. chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that Osx associated with the ZBTB16 promoter region containing the GC-rich canonical Sp1 sequence. which is the specific Osx binding site. These findings suggest that ZBTB16 acts as a downstream transcriptional regulator of Osx and can be useful as a late marker of osteoblastic differentiation. J. Cell. Biochem. 117: 2423-2434. 2016.

93,Bioinformatics field has now solidly settled itself as a control in molecular biology and incorporates an extensive variety of branches of knowledge from structural biology. genomics to gene expression studies. Bioinformatics is the application of computer technology to the management of biological information. Genomic signal processing (GSP) techniques have been connected most all around in bioinformatics and will keep on assuming an essential part in the investigation of biomedical issues. GSP refers to using the digital signal processing (DSP) methods for genomic data (e.g. DNA sequences) analysis. Recently. applications of GSP in bioinformatics have obtained great consideration such as identification of DNA protein coding regions. identification of reading frames. cancer detection and others. Cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases that the world faces and has raised the death rate in recent years. it is known medically as malignant neoplasm. so detection of it at the early stage can yield a promising approach to determine and take actions to treat with this risk. GSP is a method which can be used to detect the cancerous cells that are often caused due to genetic abnormality. This systematic review discusses some of the GSP applications in bioinformatics generally. The GSP techniques. used for cancer detection especially. are presented to collect the recent results and what has been reached at this point to be a new subject of research....,biochemistry,CS,Molecular biology,Bioinformatics
94,The tertiary structure of the proteins determines their functions. Therefore. the predicting of protein's tertiary structure. based on the primary amino acid sequence from long time. is the most important and challenging subject in biochemistry. molecular biology. and biophysics. One of the most popular protein structure prediction methods. called Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) model. is based on the observation that in polar environment hydrophobic amino acids are in the core of the molecule-in contact between them and more polar amino acids are in contact with the polar environment. In this study. we present a new mixed integer programming formulation. exact algorithm. and two heuristic algorithms to solve the protein folding problem stated as a combinatorial optimization problem in a simple cubic lattice.

95,The chances of raising crop productivity to enhance global food security would be greatly improved if we had a complete understanding of all the biological mechanisms that underpinned traits such as crop yield. disease resistance or nutrient and water use efficiency. With more crop genomes emerging all the time. we are nearer having the basic information. at the gene-level. to begin assembling crop gene catalogues and using data from other plant species to understand how the genes function and how their interactions govern crop development and physiology. Unfortunately. the task of creating such a complete knowledge base of gene functions. interaction networks and trait biology is technically challenging because the relevant data are dispersed in myriad databases in a variety of data formats with variable quality and coverage. In this paper we present a general approach for building genomescale knowledge networks that provide a unified representation of heterogeneous but interconnected datasets to enable effective knowledge mining and gene discovery. We describe the datasets and outline the methods. work flows and tools that we have developed for creating and visualising these networks for the major crop species. wheat and barley. We present the global characteristics of such knowledge networks and with an example linking a seed size phenotype to a barley WRKY transcription factor orthologous to TTG2 from Arabidopsis. we illustrate the value of integrated data in biological knowledge discovery. The software we have developed (www.ondex.org) and the knowledge resources (http://knetminer.rothamsted.ac.uk) we have created are all open-source and provide a first step towards systematic and evidence-based gene discovery in order to facilitate crop improvement.

96,Hepatocellular carcinoma is the major form of primary liver cancer. which is the second and sixth leading cause of cancer-related death in men and women. respectively. Extensive research indicates that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. which plays a pivotal role in growth. development. and differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma. is one of the major signaling pathways that is dysregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. Cyclin D1 is a proto-oncogene and is one of the major regulators of Wnt signaling pathway. and its overexpression has been detected in various types of cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma. Using several validated bioinformatic databases. we predicted that the microRNAs are capable of targeting 3'-untranslated region of Cyclin D1 messenger RNA. According to the results. miR-20a was selected as the highest ranking microRNA targeting Cyclin D1 messenger RNA. Luciferase assay was recruited to confirm bioinformatic prediction results. Cyclin D1 expression was first assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in HepG2 cell line. Afterward. HepG2 cells were transduced by lentiviruses containing miR-20a. Then. the expression of miR-20a and Cyclin D1 was evaluated. The results of luciferase assay demonstrated targeting of 3'-untranslated region of Cyclin D1 messenger RNA by miR-20a. Furthermore. 238-fold decline in Cyclin D1 expression was observed after lentiviral induction of miR-20a in HepG2 cells. The results highlighted a considerable effect of miRNA-20a induction on the down-regulation of Cyclin D1 gene. Our results suggest that miR-20a can be used as a novel candidate for therapeutic purposes and a biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
97,Eucheuma denticulatum. an economically and industrially important red alga. is a valuable marine resource. Although microRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in gene post-transcriptional regulation. no research has been conducted to identify and characterize miRNAs in E. denticulatum. In this study. we identified 134 miRNAs (133 conserved miRNAs and one novel miRNA) from 2.997.135 small-RNA reads by high-throughput sequencing combined with bioinformatics analysis. BLAST searching against miRBase uncovered 126 potential miRNA families. A conservation and diversity analysis of predicted miRNA families in different plant species was performed by comparative alignment and homology searching. A total of 4 and 13 randomly selected miRNAs were respectively validated by northern blotting and stem-loop reverse transcription PCR. thereby demonstrating the reliability of the miRNA sequencing data. Altogether. 871 potential target genes were predicted using psRobot and TargetFinder. Target genes classification and enrichment were conducted based on Gene Ontology analysis. The functions of target gene products and associated metabolic pathways were predicted by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. A Cytoscape network was constructed to explore the interrelationships of miRNAs. miRNA-target genes and target genes. A large number of miRNAs with diverse target genes will play important roles for further understanding some essential biological processes in E. denticulatum.

98,Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) Schroet.. an oomycete pathogen of Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. infects the meristematic tissues of young seedlings. The motile zoospores from the sporangia encyst. germinate and penetrate the plant tissue. Resistance to the invading pathogen is governed by the specific recognition of conserved pathogen-associated proteins or elicitors. In the present study. a zoospore protein was isolated and purified to homogeneity by a combination of size exclusion and high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC). The crude fractionated protein was able to elicit an array of defence responses in resistant and susceptible cells of pearl millet. Treatment of cultured cells of pearl millet with partially purified elicitor protein resulted in a rapid loss of cell viability in the resistant cells and the percentage of cell death was higher in the resistant than in the susceptible cells. Cultures of resistant cells showed a sharp increase in the extra cellular pH compared with susceptible cells when treated with the crude elicitor. Increased oxidative burst was also recorded in the cells treated with the crude elicitor. The purified elicitor showed unique properties. The purified protein was acidic with a pI of 5.6 as revealed by isoelectric focusing (IEF) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI) analysis showed that the elicitor had a molecular mass of 7040 daltons. The primary structure determined by N-terminal Edman degradation and searches with BLAST did not reveal similarities to any known plant pathogenic or oomycete elicitor. Higher activities of the important defence-related enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase ( PAL) and peroxidase in the resistant cell cultures than in the susceptible cell cultures treated with the purified elicitor were clearly evident. Studies of gene expression by northern blotting with heterologus peroxidase. PAL and oxalate oxidase probes showed that the mRNA transcripts were strongly up-regulated in resistant cell cultures within 30 min of elicitor treatment. The purified elicitor also demonstrated a very strong concentration-dependent sterol binding. The purified elicitor protein belongs to a class of low molecular weight oomycete elicitors with sterol carrier properties. The identified low molecular weight protein elicitor displays unique properties that can be exploited for synthesis of novel molecules for eco-friendly crop protection....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Immunology
99,Whereas significant advances have been made in understanding how exposure to early adversity gets under the skin of children to result in long term changes in developmental outcomes. the processes by which positive social relationships become biologically embedded remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to understand the pathways by which maternal and infant social environments become biologically embedded in infant cortisol reactivity. Two hundred seventy-two pregnant women and their infants were prospectively assessed during pregnancy and at 6 months postpartum. In serial mediation analyses. higher perceived social support from partners during pregnancy was associated with lower infant cortisol reactivity or larger decreases in cortisol in response to a stressor at 6 months of age via lower self-reported prenatal maternal depression and higher mother-infant interaction quality. The findings add to our understanding of how perinatal social relationships become biologically embedded in child development....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Prenatal development
0,The fast growth of the human population forces us to produce more food. but higher crop production also leads to the fast spread of diseases. Plant pathology deploys a wide range of methods that do not provide an adequate solution to all disease losses. In the case of viroids. therapeutic means of control are not available; therefore control strategies are more focused on the development of reliable detection methods to quickly exclude the infected plant material. Although viroids are the smallest and simplest plant pathogens. their identification and detection is not straightforward. Each viroid-host combination is specific. and for reliable identification. all steps from sampling to final detection must be performed accurately. In this review. several methods for viroid detection in various host plants are discussed. including their advantages and disadvantages. Even though relatively new molecular methods enable fast and sensitive detection of viroids. a combination of different methods gives the most reliable identification. Techniques based on nucleic acids may be the future for viroid detection but they still cannot replace biological indexing. which is usually essential in epidemiological and aetiological studies....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Polymerase chain reaction
1,The definition of biological individuality is one of the most discussed topics in philosophy of biology. but current debate has focused almost exclusively on evolution-based accounts. Moreover. several participants in this debate consider the notions of a biological individual and an organism as equivalent. In this paper. I show that the debates would be considerably enriched and clarified if philosophers took into account two elements. First. physiological fields are crucial for the understanding of biological individuality. Second. the category of biological individuals should be divided into two subcategories: physiological individuals and evolutionary individuals. which suggests that the notions of organism and biological individual should not be used interchangeably. I suggest that the combination of an evolutionary and a physiological perspective will enable biologists and philosophers to supply an account of biological individuality that will be both more comprehensive and more in accordance with scientific practices....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Immunology,Cell biology
2,Salivary biomarkers could be helpful to characterize breast cancer. Therefore. this review was performed to evaluate the capability of salivary biological markers in the diagnosis and monitoring of breast cancer. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed the potential diagnostic value or other discriminatory properties of biological markers in saliva of patients with breast cancer. The search was performed in six electronic databases (Cochrane. LILACS. PubMed. Science Direct. Scopus. Web of Science). In addition the biomarkers were classified according to their potential clinical application. We identified 567 pertinent studies. of which 13 met the inclusion criteria. Combined biomarker approaches demonstrated better ability to predict breast cancer patients than individual biomarkers. As single biomarlcer. namely proline. reported great capacity in both early and late stage breast cancer diagnosis. Taurine showed interesting capability to identify early breast cancer individuals. Furthermore. valine also demonstrated excellent diagnostic test accuracy for advanced stages of breast cancer. Only seven studies reported sensitivity and specificity (Zhang et al.. 2010; Streckfus et al.. 2000a; Brooks et al.. 2008; Cheng et al.. 2015; Bigler et al.. 2002; Zhong et al.. 2016; Streckfus. 2009). which varied considerably from 50% to 100%. and from 51% to 97%. respectively. In general. salivary biomarkers identified advanced stages of breast cancer better than early stages. There is currently limited evidence to confirm the putative implementation of salivary biomarkers as diagnostic tools for breast cancer. However. current review provides new research directions.

3,Background and Aim: In our previous study. we demonstrated that four microRNAs (miRNAs) (miR-26a. miR-142-3p. miR-148a. and miR-195) that were downregulated in both plasma and tumor tissues were confirmed to be promising non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for gastric cancer (GC). Methods: We used the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to assess the expression levels of the four miRNAs from paraffin-embedded surgical specimens of GC patients. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test were applied to predict the correlation between miRNAs and cumulative overall survival (OS) of patients with GC. Besides. we performed in vitro assays including cell proliferation. migration. invasion and colony formation. and apoptosis. Results: The median of miRNA expression in paraffin-embedded tissues were used as the cutoff value to classify patients into high or low expression groups. Down-regulation of miR-26a and miR-148a was significantly associated with shorter OS of GC patients either in the test set (miR-26a: P=0.009; miR-148a: P=0.005) or the validation set (miR-26a: P=0.011; miR-148a: P=0.024). When two sets were combined. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that both of miR-26a and miR-148a were independent prognostic factors for predicting OS of patients with GC (miR-26a: HR=0.76. 95% CI=0.61-0.94; miR-148a: HR=0.73. 95% CI=0.58-0.91). Furthermore. elevated expression of miR-26 significantly suppressed cell proliferation. migration. invasion and colony formation. and induced apoptosis of MGC-803 cells compared with negative control groups (P<0.05). Conclusion: These findings supported miR-26a and miR-148a could serve as potential prognostic biomarkers for GC....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
4,Power to gas (P2G) may be used to store curtailed electricity whilst converting the energy vector to gas. To be economically viable these systems require cheap electricity and a cheap concentrated source of CO2. Biogas produced from anaerobic digestion typically comprises of 60% methane and 40% CO2. The P2G system substitutes for the conventional upgrading system by using hydrogen (derived from surplus wind electricity) to react with CO2 and increases the methane output. The potential CO2 production from biogas in Ireland associated with typical wet substrates is assessed as more than 4 times greater than that required by the potential level of H-2 from curtailed electricity. Wind energy curtailment in 2020 in Ireland is assessed conservatively at 2175GW(e)h/a. Thus P2G is limited by levels of curtailment of electricity rather than biogas systems. It is shown that 1 GW(e)h of electricity used to produce H-2 for upgrading biogas in a P2G system can affect a savings of 97 tonnes CO2. The cost of hydrogen is assessed at (sic)0.96/m(3) renewable methane when the price of electricity is (sic)c5/kW(e)h. This leads to a cost of compressed renewable gas from grass of (sic)1.8/m(3). This drops to (sic)1.1/m(3) when electricity is purchased at (sic)c0.2/1cW(e)h. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved....,ECE,MAE,Electricity,Fluid mechanics
5,The beamline BL19U2 is located in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) and is its first beamline dedicated to biological material small-angle X-ray scattering (BioSAXS). The electrons come from an undulator which can provide high brilliance for the BL19U2 end stations. A double flat silicon crystal (111) monochromator is used in BL19U2. with a tunable monochromatic photon energy ranging from 7 to 15 keV. To meet the rapidly growing demands of crystallographers. biochemists and structural biologists. the BioSAXS beamline allows manual and automatic sample loading/unloading. A Pilatus 1M detector (Dectris) is employed for data collection. characterized by a high dynamic range and a short readout time. The highly automated data processing pipeline SASFLOW was integrated into BL19U2. with help from the BioSAXS group of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL. Hamburg). which provides a user-friendly interface for data processing. The BL19U2 beamline was officially opened to users in March 2015. To date. feedback from users has been positive and the number of experimental proposals at BL19U2 is increasing. A description of the new BioSAXS beamline and the setup characteristics is given. together with examples of data obtained....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,DNA/RNA sequencing

7,Background: Distinguishing recipient cells from donor ligament cells is difficult in the early graft-healing phase after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The ability to track the distribution and differentiation of recipient cells using genetically engineered transgenic (Tg) animals would have significant clinical and research effects on graft healing after ACL reconstruction. Hypothesis: Kusabira-Orange Tg pigs may allow the tracking of recipient cells infiltrating the graft after ACL reconstruction. The repopulation of recipient cells within the graft would be apparent even in the early graft-healing phase when necrotic donor cells are still present. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: In 17 genetically engineered Tg pigs. which carried the red fluorescent protein Kusabira-Orange. ACL reconstruction was performed on the right knee using a digital flexor tendon harvested from wild-type pigs. Tissue samples harvested at different time points were subjected to histological. immunohistochemical. and electron microscopic analyses. Results: At 3 weeks postoperatively. recipient cells expressing red fluorescence embraced the graft and were infiltrating the central part of the graft. These cells with oval nuclei gradually infiltrated the gap of collagen fibers. losing their regular orientation. At 6 weeks. cellularity within the graft had doubled to match that of the native ACL. while acellular necrotic regions still existed centrally. Ubiquitous cellular distributions resembling the native ACL were observed at 24 weeks. Electron microscopic analysis showed that the mean collagen fibril diameter and density gradually decreased over 24 weeks. Conclusion: Genetically engineered pigs carrying the Kusabira-Orange gene were useful animal models for analyzing intrinsic and extrinsic cellular dynamics during the course of graft healing after ACL reconstruction. Cellular repopulation by recipient cells occurred in the very early stage. and the cellular distribution within the graft resembled that in the native ACL by 24 weeks. but the reconstructed graft had not restored the ultrastructure of the native ACL by that stage. Clinical Relevance: In allograft ACL reconstruction in a pig model. cellular repopulation was completed by 24 weeks after surgery. but the collagen matrix had not resumed the ultrastructure of the native ACL. Surgeons should be aware that risks may remain with returning to sports activities at 24 weeks after surgery....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Sports Injuries
8,Food poisoning by Staphylococcus aureus is a result of ingestion of Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) produced by this bacterium and is a major source of foodborne illness. Staphylococcal enterotoxin D (SED) is one of the predominant enterotoxins recovered in Staphylococcal food poisoning incidences. including a recent outbreak in Guam affecting 300 children. Current immunology methods for SED detection cannot distinguish between the biologically active form of the toxin. which poses a threat. from the inactive form. which poses no threat. In vivo bioassays that measure emetic activity in kitten and monkeys have been used. but these methods rely upon expensive procedures using live animals and raising ethical concerns. A rapid (5 h) quantitative bioluminescence assay. using a genetically engineered T-cell Jurkat cell line expressing luciferase under regulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells response elements. in combination with the lymphoblastoid B-cell line Raji for antigen presentation. was developed. In this assay. the detection limit of biologically active SED is 100 ng/mL. which is 10 times more sensitive than the splenocyte proliferation assay. and 105 times more sensitive than monkey or kitten bioassay. Pasteurization or repeated freeze-thaw cycles had no effect on SED activity. but reduction in SED activity was shown with heat treatment at 100 degrees C for 5 min. It was also shown that milk exhibits a protective effect on SED. This bioluminescence assay may also be used to rapidly evaluate antibodies to SED for potential therapeutic application as a measurement of neutralizing biological effects of SED....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Digestive Health
9,Background: Disease surveillance in patients with bladder cancer is important for early diagnosis of progression and metastasis and for optimised treatment. Objective: To develop urine and plasma assays for disease surveillance for patients with FGFR3 and PIK3CA tumour mutations. Design. setting. and participants: Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) assays were developed and tumour DNA from two patient cohorts was screened for FGFR3 and PIK3CA hotspot mutations. One cohort included 363 patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). The other cohort included 468 patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy (Cx). Urine supernatants (NMIBC n = 216. Cx n = 27) and plasma samples (NMIBC n = 39. Cx n = 27) from patients harbouring mutations were subsequently screened using ddPCR assays. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Progression-free survival. recurrence-free survival. and overall survival were measured. Fisher's exact test. the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Cox regression analysis were applied. Results and limitations: In total. 36% of the NMIBC patients (129/363) and 11% of the Cx patients (44/403) harboured at least one FGFR3 or PIK3CA mutation. Screening of DNA from serial urine supernatants from the NMIBC cohort revealed that high levels of tumour DNA (tDNA) were associated with later disease progression in NMIBC (p = 0.003). Furthermore. high levels of tDNA in plasma samples were associated with recurrence in the Cx cohort (p = 0.016). A positive correlation between tDNA levels in urine and plasma was observed (correlation coefficient 0.6). The retrospective study design and low volumes of plasma available for analysis were limitations of the study. Conclusions: Increased levels of FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutated DNA in urine and plasma are indicative of later progression and metastasis in bladder cancer. Patient summary: Urine and plasma from patients with bladder cancer may be monitored for diagnosis of progression and metastasis using mutation assays. (C) 2016 European Association of Urology.

10,OBJECTIVE The incidence of posttraumatic ventriculomegaly (PTV) and shunt-dependent hydrocephalus after nonaccidental head trauma (NAHT) is unknown. In the present study. the authors assessed the timing of PTV development. the relationship between PTV and decompressive craniectomy (DC). and whether PTV necessitated placement of a permanent shunt. Also. NAHT/PTV cases were categorized into a temporal profile of delay in admission and evaluated for association with outcomes at discharge. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed the cases of patients diagnosed with NAHT throughout a 10-year period. Cases in which sequential CT scans had been obtained (n = 28) were evaluated for Evans' index to determine the earliest time ventricular dilation was observed. Discharge outcomes were assessed using the King's Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury score. RESULTS Thirty-nine percent (11 of 28) of the patients developed PTV. A low admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score predicted early PTV presentation (within1 week). A majority of PTV/NAHT patients presented with a subdural hematoma (both convexity and interhemispheric) and ischemic stroke. but subarachnoid hemorrhage was significantly associated with PTV/NAHT (p = 0.011). Of 6 patients undergoing a DC for intractable intracranial pressure. 4 (67%) developed PTV (p = 0.0366). These patients tended to present with lower GCS scores and develop ventriculomegaly early. Only 2 patients developed hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement. CONCLUSIONS PTV presents early after NAHT. particularly after a DC has been performed. However. the authors found that only a few PTV/NAHT patients developed shunt-dependent hydrocephalus....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health

12,Introduction: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Recently. two chemotherapy regimens have proven to improve median overall survival in comparison with gemcitabine. Based on better understanding of tumor molecular biology and of the role of tumor microenvironment. monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could be an interesting and new type of targeted treatment of PDAC. Areas covered: Preclinical and clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of several mAbs in pancreatic cancer treatment. This review will underline the most important targeted pathways by mAbs involved in this disease. including EGFR. HER-2. IGF-1 R. VEGF/VEGFR. NOTCH. WNT and immune checkpoints. Expert opinion: Despite the promising results of preclinical and phase I trials. the addition of mAbs to standard chemotherapy or in association with other target agents seems not to confirm these results in the following phase II and III trials in pancreatic cancer patients. However. an improved patient selection before treatment based on molecular characteristics in association with reliable predictive biomarkers can identified more efficacious treatment approaches. minimizing toxicity profile of these drugs....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
13,Flexible multi-generation systems (FMGs) consist of integrated and flexibly operated facilities that provide multiple links between the different sectors of the energy system. The present study treated the design optimization of a conceptual FMG which integrated a methanol-producing biorefinery with an existing combined heat and power (CHP) unit and industrial energy utility supply in the Danish city of Horsens. The objective was to optimize economic performance and minimize total CO2 emission of the FMG while it was required to meet the local district heating demand plus the thermal utility demand of the butchery. The design optimization considered: Selection. dimensioning. location and integration of processes; operation optimization with respect to both hourly variations in Operating conditions over the year as well as expected long term energy system development; and uncertainty analysis considering both investment costs and operating conditions. Applying a previously developed FMG design methodology. scalable models of the considered processes were developed and the system design was optimized with respect to hourly operation over the period 2015-2035. The optimal design with respect to both economic and environmental performance involved a maximum-sized biorefinery located next to local industry rather than in connection with the existing CHP unit. As the local industry energy demands were limited when compared to the biorefinery dimensions considered. process integration synergies were found to be marginal when compared to the economic and environmental impact of the biorefinery for the present case. Assessing the impact of uncertainties on the estimated FMG performances. the net present value (NPV) of the optimal design was estimated to vary within the range 252.5-1471.6 ME in response to changes of 25% in investment costs and methanol price. and considering two different electricity price scenarios. In addition. a change in the interest rate from 5% to 20% was found to reduce the lower bound of the NPV to 181.3 ME for reference operating conditions. The results suggest that the applied interest rate and operating conditions. in particular the methanol price. would have a much higher impact on the economic performance of the designs than corresponding uncertainties in investment costs. In addition. the study outcomes emphasize the importance of including systematic uncertainty analysis in the design optimization of FMG concepts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

14,This paper first reviews the potential causality from biomass energy to CO2 emissions and economic development within relevant literature. Later. the paper examines statistically the impacts of biomass energy consumption on CO2 emissions and GDP in the US. To this end. paper observes environmental and economic implications of biomass fuel usage throughout energy literature and launches asymmetric causality test to confirm/disconfirm the literature output. The findings of the tests indicate that biomass energy consumption per capita mitigates CO2 emissions per capita and increases GDP per capita. Eventually. upon its output. this research asserts that biomass energy consumption can be an efficient policy tool for environmentally sustainable development in the US. and. that. hence. biomass production technologies and biomass consumption need to be promoted in other countries as well as in the US. On the other hand. analyses underline the fact that policy makers should consider as well some potential constraints of biomass energy usage such as land use constraints and carbon leakage from biomass production. Therefore. although this paper explores the remedial impact of biomass on environment and growth. one may suggest also that further possible works consider the effects of biomass sources in detail to minimize the some worsening influence of biomass usage on climate change....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electric motor
15,The quality and composition of biomass as used in Portugal's thermal power plants is highly variable. The biomass consists mainly of residual forest biomass derived from forestry operations and wood waste from industrial processes. in particular paper and pulp industry. Its quality and composition is influenced by the presence of moisture and inert fragments. the latter being incorporated during collection or as a consequence of adherence to the biomass prior to collection. This variability presents difficulties for the thermal power plants; besides being an additional operational cost. the presence of large amounts of water and inerts in biomass used as a fuel. can result in problems related to the instability of the combustion and the accumulation of ash or rock that have to be removed and discarded. The objective of this paper is to review the main parameters that influence the quality of biomass. while analysing the current state-of-the-art power generation from the biomass sector in Portugal. as a new contribution to earlier studies....,ECE,biochemistry,Electricity,Northern blotting
16,Biomass is the most widely used renewable energy source in the world today. It is used mostly in solid form and. to a lesser extent. in the form of liquid fuels and gas. The utilization of biomass for energy production has increased at only a modest rate in modern times. Biomass is the major source of energy in rural Turkey. Biomass is used to meet a variety of energy needs. including generating electricity. heating homes. fueling vehicles and providing process heat for industrial facilities. Biomass potential includes wood. animal and plant wastes. Among the biomass energy sources. fuel wood seems to be the most interesting because its share of the total energy production of Turkey is high at 14%. The total biomass energy potential of Turkey is about 33 million tons of oil equivalents (Mtoe). The amount of usable biomass potential of Turkey is approximately 17 Mtoe. The electrical production potential from usable bioenergy sources are 73 MW in 2010 and corporate income and represent more than 280.000 jobs. This study shows that there is important biomass energy potential for climate change mitigation and energy sustainability in Turkey. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

17,Three-dimensional (3D) carbon materials derived from waste biomass have been attracted increasing attention in catalysis and materials science because of their great potential of catalyst supports with respect to multi-functionality. unique structures. high surface area. and low cost. Here. we present a facile and efficient way for preparing 3D heterogeneous catalysts based on vertical MnO2 wires deposited on hemp-derived 3D porous carbon. The 3D porous carbon materials are fabricated by carbonization and activation processes using hemp (Cannabis Sttiva L). These 3D porous carbon materials are employed as catalyst supports for direct deposition of vertical MnO2 wires using a one-step hydrothermal method. The XRD and XPS results reveal the crystalline structure of alpha-MnO2 wires. The resultant composites are further employed as a catalyst for glycolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) with high conversion yield of 98%. which is expected to be expressly profitable for plastics recycling industry.

18,Greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector can significantly be reduced by replacing fossil based fuels with green alternatives. Various alternative fuel concepts have been developed differing in used sustainable feedstock. synthesis technology and final fuel characteristics. Whether these fuels can succeed in the market will depend on the fuel net production costs. the expected cost reduction potentials and the political intention to mitigate climate change. Results of previous studies for the techno-economic assessment of alternative fuels are difficult to compare due to significant differences in the applied methodology. level of detail and key assumptions in terms of economic factors and market prices. In this work. a standardized methodology for techno-economic analysis of fuel production processes is presented and exemplarily applied on sustainable fuels from Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. The methodology was adapted from a best practice approach from chemical industry and consists of three main steps: (A) literature survey on feasible production designs. (B) flowsheet simulation and (C) techno-economic assessment with the in-house software tool TEPET (Techno-Economic Process Evaluation Tool). It is shown that the standardized approach enables qualitative and quantitative statements regarding the technical and economic feasibility of fuel synthesis concepts including the identification of the appropriate fuel production concept due to predefined framework conditions. Results from the case study on green FT fuels reveal that Biomass-to-Liquid (BtL) concepts have lowest production costs at high electricity costs. whereas the Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and Power and Biomass-to-Liquid (PBtL) concepts are superior at low electricity prices. Fuel production costs in the range of 1.2 and 2.8 (sic)(2014)/1 were estimated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Digital control
19,Controversy exists regardingwhether violent shaking is harmful to infants in the absence of impact. In this study. our objective was to characterize the biomechanical response of the infant head during shaking through use of an instrumented anthropomorphic test device (commonly referred to as a "crash test dummy'' or surrogate) representing a human infant and having improved biofidelity. A series of tests were conducted to simulate violent shaking of an infant surrogate. The Aprica 2.5 infant surrogate represented a 5th percentile Japanese newborn. A 50th percentile Japanese adult male was recruited to shake the infant surrogate in the sagittal plane. Triaxial linear accelerometers positioned at the center of mass and apex of the head recorded accelerations during shaking. Five shaking test series. each 3-4 sec in duration. were conducted. Outcome measures derived from accelerometer recordings were examined for trends. Head/neck kinematics were characterized during shaking events; mean peak neck flexion was 1.98 radians (113 degrees) and mean peak neck extension was 2.16 radians (123 degrees). The maximum angular acceleration across all test series was 13.260 radians/sec 2 (during chin-to-chest contact). Peak angular velocity was 105.7 radians/sec (during chin-to-chest contact). Acceleration pulse durations ranged from 72.1 to 168.2ms. Using an infant surrogate with improved biofidelity. we found higher angular acceleration and higher angular velocity than previously reported during infant surrogate shaking experiments. Findings highlight the importance of surrogate biofidelity when investigating shaking....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health
20,This brief presents a submicrowatt. offset-free. and implantable system for a biomedical capacitive sensor. The system is powered by a 13.56-MHz radio frequency signal and performs sensor signal amplification. analog-to-digital conversion. and load-shift keying uplink data transmission within 640 mu s. An ultralow-power capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC) is designed by replacing a power-hungry operational amplifier with a subthreshold inverter in a switched-capacitor amplifier (SC-amp). A fast-response-gain compensation method is employed to reduce the gain error of the SC-amp while achieving high energy efficiency for the CDC. To eliminate the offset. a two-step autocalibration is applied. The application-specific integrated circuit is implemented in the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 90-nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. and the whole system achieves an 8.02 effective number of bits with 9-bit linearity while consuming only 5.5 mu W....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
21,Background: The Drug Ontology (DrOn) is an OWL2-based representation of drug products and their ingredients. mechanisms of action. strengths. and dose forms. We originally created DrOn for use cases in comparative effectiveness research. primarily to identify historically complete sets of United States National Drug Codes (NDCs) that represent packaged drug products. by the ingredient(s). mechanism(s) of action. and so on contained in those products. Although we had designed DrOn from the outset to carefully distinguish those entities that have a therapeutic indication from those entities that have a molecular mechanism of action. we had not previously represented in DrOn any particular therapeutic indication. Results: In this work. we add therapeutic indications for three research use cases: resistant hypertension. malaria. and opioid abuse research. We also added mechanisms of action for opioid analgesics and added 108 classes representing drug products in response to a large term request from the Program for Resistance. Immunology. Surveillance and Modeling of Malaria in Uganda (PRISM) project. The net result is a new version of DrOn. current to May 2016. that represents three major therapeutic classes of drugs and six new mechanisms of action. Conclusions: A therapeutic indication of a drug product is represented as a therapeutic function in DrOn. Adverse effects of drug products. as well as other therapeutic uses for which the drug product was not designed are dispositions. Our work provides a framework for representing additional therapeutic indications. adverse effects. and uses of drug products beyond their design. Our work also validated our past modeling decisions for specific types of mechanisms of action. namely effects mediated via receptor and/or enzyme binding.

23,Finger vein recognition has drawn increasing attention from biometrics community due to its security and convenience. In this paper. a novel discriminative binary codes (DBC) learning method is proposed for finger vein recognition. First of all. subject relation graph is built to capture correlations among subjects. Based on the relation graph. binary templates are transformed to describe vein characteristics of subjects. To ensure that templates are discriminative and representative. graph transform is formulated into an optimization problem. in which the distance between templates from different subjects is maximized and templates provide maximum information about subjects. At last. supervised information for training instances is provided by the obtained binary templates. and SVMs are trained as the code learner for each bit. Compared with existing binary codes for finger vein recognition. DBC are more discriminative and shorter. In addition. they are generated with considering the relationships among subjects which may be useful to improve performance. Experimental results on PolyU database and MLA database demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DBC for finger vein recognition and retrieval....,Psychology,CS,Attention,Machine learning
24,Calcium carbonate skeletal tissues in metazoans comprise a small quantity of occluded organic macromolecules. mostly proteins and polysaccharides that constitute the skeletal matrix. Because its functions in modulating the biomineralization process are well known. the skeletal matrix has been extensively studied. successively via classical biochemical approaches. via molecular biology and. in recent years. via transcriptomics and proteomics. The optimistic view that the deposition of calcium carbonate minerals requires a limited number of macromolecules has been challenged. in the last decade. by high throughput approaches. Such approaches have made possible the rapid identification of large sets of mineral-associated proteins. i.e.. 'skeletal repertoires' or 'skeletomes'. in several calcifying animal models. ranging from sponges to echinoderms. One of the consequences of this expanding set of data is that a simple definition of the skeletal matrix is no longer possible. This increase in available data. however. makes it easier to compare skeletal repertoires. shedding light on the fundamental evolutionary mechanisms affecting matrix components.

27,Sialic acid sugars that terminate cell-surface glycans form the ligands for the sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) family. which are immunomodulatory receptors expressed by immune cells. Interactions between sialic acid and Siglecs regulate the immune system. and aberrations contribute to pathologies like autoimmunity and cancer. Sialic acid/Siglec interactions between living cells are difficult to study owing to a lack of specific tools. Here. we report a glycoengineering approach to remodel the sialic acids of living cells and their binding to Siglecs. Using bioorthogonal chemistry. a library of cells with more than sixty different sialic acid modifications was generated that showed dramatically increased binding toward the different Siglec family members. Rational design reduced cross-reactivity and led to the discovery of three selective Siglec-5/14 ligands. Furthermore. glyco-engineered cells carrying sialic acid ligands for Siglec-3 dampened the activation of Siglec-3(+) monocytic cells through the NF-kappa B and IRF pathways....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Immunology,Immunology
28,AimsThe aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a real-time PCR technology for microbiological control methods to examine individualized cell therapeutics. an emerging class of pharmaceutical formulations. Methods and ResultsOligonucleotide primers and hybridization probe for bacterial detection targeting the 16SrRNA gene were adapted based on Nadkarni etal. [Microbiology148 (2002) 257]. For detection of yeast and moulds. primers and probe were designed from conserved sequences of the 18SrRNA gene in this study. The real-time PCR assays were tested on genomic DNA of Escherichia coli and Candida albicans to assess efficiency and linear dynamic range. After successful establishment of robust real-time PCRs. applicability of the assays was evaluated by extracting microbial target DNA from cell-based preparations. Different commercial DNA extraction methods were compared identifying the MagNA Pure DNA Isolation Kit III as the method of choice. Sensitivity was examined for different strains and a detection limit of 10(2)-10(3) CFU per ml in a sample containing similar to 10(6) mammalian cells per ml was achieved. ConclusionsThis study reports the successful establishment of two qualitative real-time PCR assays. enabling in general the broad-range detection of microbial contaminants in a cell-based sample matrix. Significance and Impact of the StudyIndividualized cell therapeutics tend to have a short shelf life. Due to lengthy incubation periods. compendial testing according to current pharmacopoeial guidelines may not be applicable. We report a suitable alternative method upon which future microbiological quality control methods for such products could be based on. However. to implement valid rapid microbiological testing methods using real-time PCR technology. further challenges need to be addressed....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Parkinson's Disease
29,During embryogenesis. the spherical inner cell mass (ICM) proliferates in the confined environment of a blastocyst. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from the ICM. and mimicking embryogenesis in vitro. mouse ESCs (mESCs) are often cultured in hanging droplets. This promotes the formation of a spheroid as the cells sediment and aggregate owing to increased physical confinement and cell-cell interactions. In contrast. mESCs form two-dimensional monolayers on flat substrates and it remains unclear if the difference in organization is owing to a lack of physical confinement or increased cell-substrate versus cell-cell interactions. Employing microfabricated substrates. we demonstrate that a single geometric degree of physical confinement on a surface can also initiate spherogenesis. Experiment and computation reveal that a balance between cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions finely controls the morphology and organization of mESC aggregates. Physical confinement is thus an important regulatory cue in the three-dimensional organization and morphogenesis of developing cells....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Alzheimer's Disease
30,Context: Hypericum perforatum L.. commonly known as St. John's wort. is practised as an alternative medicine against depression. Conversely. its remedial efficacy is indulged by various adverse effects that are recuperated in formulating nanoscaled commercial capsules encased by the biopolymer chitosan. A potential application of nanoencapsulation with regards to polymer enhances a slow controlled release of the targeted drug to achieve the desired delay until the right stimulus is obtained. Aims: To value synthesizing biopolymeric nanocomposites encapsulating St. John's wort commercial capsules substantiating it with a study of animal model of depression to endorse the effect of nanocapsulated drug as an effective brain drug. Methods The nanoparticulated suspension was prepared by ionic gelation technique and characterized to attest its antidepressant activity by in vivo studies. Results: The drug binding efficiency was endorsed by FT-IR studies and the nanoparticles were characterized by an average particle size of 211.4 nm with a positive zeta potential of 45.9 mV. The animal despair studies on depression induced mice models displayed a significant difference in the immobility time during force swimming and tail suspension test. The commercial capsules were administed orally (p.o.. 50 and 100 mg/kg). The animal despair studies were substantiated with affirmative biochemical assessments like SOD. CAT. GP(x). GSH and LPO and compared with control groups. Conclusions: The outcomes of this work manifest the calibre of St. John's wort nanocomposites in a lower dosage that can alleviate depression and reduce side effects....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Depression
31,Building blocks made from renewable sources attract increasing attention for the design of new polymer systems. Recently. in this particular context. cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) have gained great interest in both academic research and industry. mainly on account of their ability to reinforce range of polymer matrices and afford nanocomposites with attractive mechanical properties. The limited thermal stability of conventionally produced cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) has. however. so far limited the range of polymers that could be used as basis for melt-processed CNC nanocomposites. We herein show that a commercially accessible nanocrystal source. a particular grade of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). can easily be converted into thermally stable CNCs by ultrasonication in phosphoric acid. A scalable melt-mixing process was used to produce nanocomposites of these CNCs with a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) elastomer. A significant improvement of the room temperature storage modulus from 40 MPa (neat polymer) to 120 MPa (10% w/w CNC) was observed. The introduction of CNCs not only increased the stiffness of the polymer matrix. but also improved the shape memory properties of the nanocomposite. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals. Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

32,In this paper. a new low power. low noise operational amplifier dedicated to implantable biomedical applications is introduced. The amplifier is designed to minimize input referred noise and power consnmption. To rednce inpnt thermal noise. we use the EKV Model to set the bias currents of the transistors. To rednce the flicker noise. PMOS inpnt transistors with large gate areas and operating in weak inversion are used. The noise rednction techniqne of switched biasing is then applied. which involves switching the transistor periodically between accnmnlation (cntoff) and inversion region. This helps to fnrther reduce the flicker noise of the transistors. The use of switched biasing allows ns to rednce the inpnt noise. withont having to increase the current and thus allows us to avoid the problem of trading power with noise. Using this techniqne. we are able to achieve an extremely low input noise of 2.89/mu V-rms in the desired bandwidth. at a small snpply cnrrent of 4.8/mu A. The additional circuitry required for switched biasing consumes minimal power. and the average power consnmption of the amplifier is 15.174/mu W. which makes it ideal for implantable applications. The gain of the amplifier is 76.2dB in the required frequency range. with a phase margin of 74 degrees and a CMRR greater than 120dB at all frequencies. The circuit is designed using the TSMC 0.18/mu m process. in the Analog Design Environment of Cadence Virtuoso. The performance of the circuit is studied at all process corners. namely TT. FF. SS. SF and FS. The simulations are carried out at 36.9 degrees C. the normal human body temperature....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Operational amplifier
33,Industrialization of mammalian cell culture has been achieved by integrating knowledge from several applying core concepts of chemical engineering. cellular and molecular biology. and biochemistry.

34,Recombinant consensus interferon (CIFN) is a therapeutic protein with molecular weight of 19.5kDa having broad spectrum antiviral activity. Recombinant human CIFN (rhCIFN) has previously been expressed in Escherichia coli using isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). a non-metabolizable and expensive compound. as inducer. For economical and commercial-scale recombinant protein production. it is greatly needed to increase the product yield in a limited time frame to reduce the processing cost. To reduce the cost of production of rhCIFN in E. coli. induction was accomplished by using lactose instead of IPTG. Lactose induction (14g/L) in shake flask experiment resulted in higher yield as compared with 1mM IPTG. Finally. with single-step purification on DEAE sepharose. 150mg/L of >98% pure rhCIFN was achieved. In the present study. an attempt was made to develop a low cost process for producing quality product with high purity. Methods devised may be helpful for pilot-scale production of recombinant proteins at low cost. (C) 2015 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

35,We analyzed 115 iliac crest bone marrow biopsy specimens from 101 patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. divided into a test (n = 57) and a validation (n = 58) set. We developed a score based on computed tomography Hounsfield units and lactate dehydrogenase levels. which were associated with a positive biopsy result. The score can be used to select patients for whom a bone marrow biopsy will provide tissue for molecular characterization. Background: The urgent need for castration-resistant prostate cancer molecular characterization to guide treatment has been constrained by the disease's predilection to metastasize primarily to bone. We hypothesized that the use of clinical and imaging criteria could maximize tissue acquisition from bone marrow biopsies (BMBs). We aimed to develop a score for the selection of patients undergoing BMB. Materials and Methods: A total of 115 BMBs were performed in 101 patients: 57 were included in a derivation set and 58 were used as the validation set. The clinical and laboratory data and prebiopsy computed tomography parameters (Hounsfield units [HUs]) were determined. A score for the prediction of biopsy positivity was developed from logistic regression analysis of the derivation set and tested in the validation set. Results: Of the 115 biopsy specimens. 75 (62.5%) were positive; 35 (61.4%) in the test set and 40 (69%) in the validation set. On univariable analysis. hemoglobin (P = .019). lactate dehydrogenase (P = .003). prostate specific antigen (P = .005). and mean HUs (P = .004) were selected. A score based on the LDH level (>= 225 IU/L) and mean HUs (>= 125) was developed in multivariate analysis and was associated with BMB positivity in the validation set (odds ratio. 5.1; 95% confidence interval. 1.9%-13.4%; P = .001). The area under the curve of the score was 0.79 in the test set and 0.77 in the validation set. Conclusion: BMB of the iliac crest is a feasible technique for obtaining tumor tissue for genomic analysis in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer metastatic to the bone. A signature based on the mean HUs and LDH level can predict a positive yield with acceptable internal validity. Prospective studies of independent cohorts are needed to establish the external validity of the score. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

36,Background: Driven by a range of sustainability challenges. e.g. climate change. resource depletion and expanding populations. a circular bioeconomy is emerging and expected to evolve progressively in the coming decades. South Africa along with other BRICS countries (Brazil. Russia. India and China) represents the emerging bioeconomy and contributes significantly to global sugar market. In our research. South Africa is used as a case study to demonstrate the sustainable design for the future biorefineries annexed to existing sugar industry. Detailed techno-economic evaluation and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) were applied to model alternative routes for converting sugarcane residues (bagasse and trash) to selected biofuel and/or biochemicals (ethanol. ethanol and lactic acid. ethanol and furfural. butanol. methanol and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. with co-production of surplus electricity) in an energy self-sufficient biorefinery system. Results: Economic assessment indicated that methanol synthesis with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 16.7% and ethanol-lactic acid co-production (20.5%) met the minimum investment criteria of 15%. while the latter had the lowest sensitivity to market price amongst all the scenarios. LCA results demonstrated that sugarcane cultivation was the most significant contributor to environmental impacts in all of the scenarios. other than the furfural production scenario in which a key step. a biphasic process with tetrahydrofuran solvent. had the most significant contribution. Conclusion: Overall. the thermochemical routes presented environmental advantages over biochemical pathways on most of the impact categories. except for acidification and eutrophication. Of the investigated scenarios. furfural production delivered the inferior environmental performance. while methanol production performed best due to its low reagent consumption. The combined techno-economic and environmental assessments identified the performance- limiting steps in the 2G biorefinery design for sugarcane industry and highlighted the technology development opportunities under circular bioeconomy context....,ECE,biochemistry,Electricity,Enzymology
37,Bioremediation plays an important role in oil spill management and bio-electrochemical treatment systems are supposed to represent a new technology for both effective remediation and energy recovery. Diesel removal rate increased by four times in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) since the electrode served as an electron acceptor. and high power density (29.05 W m(-3)) at current density 72.38 A m(-3) was achieved using diesel (v/v 1%) as the sole substrate. As revealed by Scanning electron microscope images. carbon fibres in the anode electrode were covered with biofilm and the bacterial colloids which build the link between carbon fibres and enhance electron transmission. Trace metabolites produced during the anaerobic biodegradation were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These metabolites may act as emulsifying agents that benefit oil dispersion and play a vital role in bioremediation of oil spills in field applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

38,Here. we aimed our attention at the synthesis of carbon dots (C-dots) with the ability to interact with DNA to suggest an approach for the detection of DNA damage. Primarily. C-dots modified with amine moieties were synthesized using the one-step microwave pyrolysis of citric acid in the presence of diethylenetriamine. The C-dots showed strong photoluminescence with a quantum yield of 4%. In addition. the C-dots (2.8 +/- 0.8 nm) possessed a good colloidal stability and exhibited a positive surface charge (zeta=36 mV) at a neutral pH. An interaction study of the C-dots and the DNA fragment of lambda bacteriophage was performed. and the DNA binding resulted in changes to the photoluminescent and absorption properties of the C-dots. A binding of the C-dots to DNA was also observed as a change to DNA electrophoretic mobility and a decreased ability to intercalate ethidium bromide (EtBr). Moreover. the Forster (or fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the C-dots and EtBr was studied. in which the C-dots serve as an excitation energy donor and the EtBr serves as an acceptor. When DNA was damaged using ultraviolet (UV) radiation (lambda=254 nm) and hydroxyl radicals. the intensity of the emitted photoluminescence at 612 nm significantly decreased. The concept was proved on analysis of the genomic DNA from PC-3 cells and DNA isolated from melanoma tissues....,Psychology,biochemistry,Attention,DNA/RNA sequencing
39,This paper presents a low-power. low-noise CMOS instrumentation amplifier intended for use in wireless bio-potential monitoring system. It employs a capacitively-coupled topology to achieve high power efficiency. In order to depress the noise. chopper-stabilized technique is used and a transconductance-boost technique is introduced in low-noise amplifier (LNA). All MOS transistors implemented in LNA are biased in subthreshold region with a supply voltage of 0.5 V to reduce the power consumption. Moreover. a DC-servo loop (DSL) is implemented to realize a high-pass corner for electrode offset cancellation. Implemented in a 0.18 mu m CMOS process. the front-end circuit occupies 0.48 mm(2) and draws 1.5 mu A. The capacitively-coupled chopper-stabilized instrumentation amplifier (CCIA) draws 800 nA and its input-referred noise is 3.5 mu V-rms integrated from 0.5 to 1 kHz. which results in a NEF of 3.8 and a PEF of 7.2 respectively. The whole circuit achieves 98 dB CMRR and 73 dB PSRR. The total input-referred noise of the front-end instrumentation amplifier including the DSL is 4.3 mu V-rms integrated from 0.5 to 1 kHz.

40,Foodborne pathogens have been a cause of a large number of diseases worldwide and more so in developing countries. This has a major economic impact. It is important to contain them. and to do so. early detection is very crucial. Detection and diagnostics relied on culture-based methods to begin with and have developed in the recent past parallel to the developments towards immunological methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and molecular biology-based methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The aim has always been to find a rapid. sensitive. specific and costeffective method. Ranging from culturing of microbes to the futuristic biosensor technology. the methods have had this common goal.

41,Unwanted immune responses to therapeutic proteins can severely impact their safety and efficacy. Studies show that the presence of trace amounts of host cells and process-related impurities that stimulate pattern recognition receptors (PRR) can cause local inflammation and enhance product immunogenicity. Here we used purified PRR agonists as model impurities to assess the minimal level of individual innate immune response modulating impurities (IIRMIs) that could activate a local immune response. We show that levels of endotoxin as low as 10 pg (0.01 EU). 1 ng for polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (PolyI: C). 100 ng for synthetic diacylated liopprotein. thiazoloquinolone compound. or muramyl dipeptide. 1 mg for flagellin or b-glucan. or 5 mg for CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide increased expression of genes linked to innate immune activation and inflammatory processes in the skin of rhesusmacaques. Furthermore. spiking studies using rasburicase as a model therapeutic showed that the levels of PRR agonists that induced detectable gene upregulation in the skin were associated with increased immunogenicity for rasburicase. This study underscores the need for testing multiple IIRMIs in biologics. strengthening the connection between the local mRNA induction in skin. innate immune activation. and antibody development in primates. and provides an indication of the levels of IIRMI in therapeutic products that could impact product immunogenicity.

42,In the nearly 20 years since Rabinow's 1996 "Artificiality and Enlightenment: From Sociobiology to Biosociality." scholarly attention to biosociality and related concepts such as biological citizenship have expanded Foucault's theories of biopolitics. updating them-as it were-for the 21st century. In this commentary. I explicate these "new biopolitical theories" and propose a schema for operationalizing them for deductive analyses in ethnographic research. I illustrate the way this schema may be applied with examples from an ethnographic study on autism in Italy. In doing so. I provide a model of new biopolitical theory that can be used in future projects in a variety of research settings and put scholarship on biosocialities and biological citizenships in more explicit conversation with each other. Such robust conversation will further scholarly understanding of biopolitics in general and of the local particularity of biologies. biomedicines. and politics that affect them....,Psychology,Medical,Attention,Autism

44,Biocatalysis is a fundamental concept in biotechnology. The topic integrates knowledge of several disciplines; therefore. it was included in the course " design and optimization of biological systems" which is offered in the biochemistry curricula. We selected the ciliate tetrahymena as an example of a eukaryotic system with potential for the biotransformation of sterol metabolites of industrial interest; in particular. we focused on the conversion of cholesterol to provitamin D-3. The students work with wild type and recombinant strains and learn how sterol pathways could be modified to obtain diverse sterol moieties. During the course the students identify and measure the concentration of sterols. They also search for related genes by bioinformatic analysis. Additionally. the students compare biotransformation rates. growing the ciliate in plate and in a bioreactor. Finally. they use fluorescence microscopy to localize an enzyme involved in biotransformation. The last day each team makes an oral presentation. explaining the results obtained and responds to a series of key questions posed by the teachers. which determine the final mark. In our experience. this course enables undergraduate students to become acquainted with the principles of biocatalysis as well as with standard and modern techniques. through a simple and robust laboratory exercise. using a biological system for the conversion of valuable pharmaceutical moieties.

46,This study evaluated the effect of an aluminosilicate mineral additive-Biotite V (BV) on growth performance. the immunological and adrenal responses in weaned pigs after Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Thirty-two crossbred weaned pigs were used in this 2x2 factorial experiment. with dietary treatment (basal diet with or without 0.45% BV supplementation) and LPS challenge (challenged or not challenged) as two main factors. On day 14 and 21. pigs were injected intraperitoneally with either 100 mu g/kg body weight of LPS or an equivalent amount of sterile saline. Blood samples were collected 3 h after the first challenge followed by total and differential leukocyte counts and analysis of plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)). cortisol. insulin. and biochemical parameters. Body weight and feed intake were measured weekly throughout the 4-week experiment. The results showed that both LPS challenges reduced average daily gain (ADG) (P < 0.05) and increased feed/gain (P < 0.001). and BV decreased feed/gain (P < 0.05) of immunology challenged pigs. The LPS challengexdiet interactions were observed for ADG (P < 0.05) and feed/gain (P < 0.05) during both challenge. LPS challenge reduced the number of white blood cells. lymphocytes. monocytes. and neutrophils (P < 0.05). LPS challengexdiet interaction was observed for plasma TNF-alpha (P < 0.05) concentration. showing decreased plasma TNF-alpha response to LPS challenged in pigs receiving BV. But no LPS challenge x diet interaction was observed for plasma cortisol or PGE(2). There was a diet effect for plasma insulin (P < 0.05) and glucose (P < 0.05). showing increased plasma insulin and decreased glucose with BV supplementation. but no LPS challengexdiet interaction was observed. We conclude that BV improved the weight gain and feed efficiency of weaned pigs during an immunological challenge by suppressing the proinflammatory cytokine release....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Immunology,Immunology

49,The propagation of Analog Single Event Transients (ASETs) to multiple outputs of Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJTs) Integrated Circuits (ICs) is reported for the first time. The results demonstrate that ASETs can appear at several outputs of a BJT amplifier or comparator as a result of a single ion or single laser pulse strike at a single physical location on the chip of a large-scale integrated BJT analog circuit. This is independent of interconnect cross-talk or charge-sharing effects. Laser experiments. together with SPICE simulations and analysis of the ASET's propagation in the s-domain are used to explain how multiple-output transients (MOTs) are generated and propagate in the device. This study demonstrates that both the charge collection associated with an ASET and the ASET's shape. commonly used to characterize the propagation of SETs in devices and systems. are unable to explain quantitatively how MOTs propagate through an integrated analog circuit. The analysis methodology adopted here involves combining the Fourier transform of the propagating signal and the current-source transfer function in the s-domain. This approach reveals the mechanisms involved in the transient signal propagation from its point of generation to one or more outputs without the signal following a continuous interconnect path....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
50,Objective: To examine emotion processing in euthymic bipolar patients (EBP) compared to healthy controls. In addition. to determine whether or not there is an association between emotion processing and psychosocial functioning. Material and methods: A sample of 60 EBP and 60 healthy controls matched for age. gender. education level. and premorbid intelligence were studied. All subjects were assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and two additional executive function measures: the Trail Making Test-Part B and the Stroop Test. Emotion processing was examined using the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). Psychosocial functioning was assessed using the Functional Assessment Short Test (FAST). Results: Euthymic bipolar patients obtained lower scores than controls in all MSCEIT measures except for the using emotions branch. Likewise. EBP obtained a worse performance than healthy controls in all neurocognitive domains. Correlation between MSCEIT strategic area measures and FAST total score was found (r = -0.311; P < 0.016). Regression analysis showed that residual depressive symptomatology explains a 9.1% of the variance in functional outcome. MSCEIT strategic area score explained an additional 8.6%. Neurocognition did not increase the percentage of the variance explained by emotion processing. Conclusions: Euthymic bipolar patients exhibit deficits in emotion processing. Emotion processing is associated with social functioning in these patients....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Schizophrenia
51,Background: Up to 60% of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) have a history of traumatic events. which is associated with greater episode severity. higher risk of comorbidity and higher relapse rates. Trauma-focused treatment strategies for BD are thus necessary but studies are currently scarce. The aim of this study is to examine whether Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy focusing on adherence. insight. de-idealisation of manic symptoms. prodromal symptoms and mood stabilization can reduce episode severity and relapse rates and increase cognitive performance and functioning in patients with BD. Methods/ design: This is a single-blind. randomized controlled. multicentre trial in which 82 patients with BD and a history of traumatic events will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of two treatment arms: EMDR therapy or supportive therapy. Patients in both groups will receive 20 psychotherapeutic sessions. 60 min each. during 6 months. The primary outcome is a reduction of affective episodes after 12 and 24 months in favour of the EMDR group. As secondary outcome we postulate a greater reduction in affective symptoms in the EMDR group (as measured by the Bipolar Depression Rating Scale. the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression Scale modified for BD). and a better performance in cognitive state. social cognition and functioning (as measured by the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry. The Mayer-SaloveyCaruso Emotional Intelligence Test and the Functioning Assessment Short Test. respectively). Traumatic events will be evaluated by The Holmes-Rahe Life Stress Inventory. the Clinician-administered PTSD Scale and the Impact of Event Scale. Discussion: The results of this study will provide evidence whether a specific EMDR protocol for patients with BD is effective in reducing affective episodes. affective symptoms and functional. cognitive and trauma...,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Bipolar Disorder
52,Objectives: Emotional processing abnormalities have been implicated in bipolar disorder (BD) but studies are typically small and uncontrolled. Here. facial expression recognition was explored in a large and naturalistically recruited cohort of BD patients. Methods: 271 patients with BD completed the facial expression recognition task. The effects of current medication together with the influence of current mood state and diagnostic subtype were assessed whilst controlling for the effects of demographic variables. Results: Patients who were currently receiving treatment with lithium demonstrated significantly poorer accuracy in recognising angry faces. an effect that held in a monotherapy sub-analysis comparing those participants on lithium only and those who were medication-free. Accuracy in recognising angry faces was also lower amongst participants currently taking dopamine antagonists (antipsychotics). Higher levels of current depressive symptoms were linked to poorer accuracy at identifying happy faces. Conclusion: Use of lithium and possibly dopamine antagonists may be associated with reduced processing of anger cues in BD. Findings support the existence of mood-congruent negative biases associated with depressive symptoms in BD. Observational cohort studies provide opportunities to explore the substantial effects of demographic. psychometric and clinical variables on cognitive performance and emotional processing....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Schizophrenia
53,In patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. abnormalities in excitatory and/or inhibitory neurotransmission and neuronal plasticity may lead to aberrant functional connectivity patterns within large brain networks. Network dysfunction in association with altered brain levels of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid have been identified in both animal and human studies of depression. In addition. evidence of an antidepressant response to subanesthetic-dose ketamine has led to a collection of studies that have examined neurochemical (e.g.. glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acidergic) and functional imaging correlates associated with such an effect. Results from these studies suggest that an antidepressant response in association with ketamine occurs. in part. by reversing these neurochemical/physiological disturbances. Future studies in depression will require a combination of neuroimaging approaches from which more biologically homogeneous subgroups can be identified. particularly with respect to treatment response biomarkers of glutamatergic modulation....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Depression
54,Most theoretical frameworks regarding the role of life stress in bipolar disorders (BD) do not incorporate the possibility of a changing relationship between psychosocial context and episode initiation across the course of the disorder. The kindling hypothesis theorizes that over the longitudinal course of recurrent affective disorders. the relationship between major life stressors and episode initiation declines (Post. 1992). The present study aimed to test an extension of the kindling hypothesis in BD by examining the effect of early life adversity on the relationship between proximal life events and prospectively assessed mood episodes. Data from 145 bipolar participants (59.3% female. 75.2% Caucasian. and mean age of 20.19 years; SD = 1.75 years) were collected as part of the Temple-Wisconsin Longitudinal Investigation of Bipolar Spectrum Project (112 Bipolar II; 33 Cyclothymic disorder). Participants completed a self-report measure of early adversity at baseline and interview-assessed mood episodes and life events at regular 4-month follow-ups. Results indicate that early childhood adversity sensitized bipolar participants to the effects of recent stressors only for depressive episodes and not hypomanic episodes within BD. This was particularly the case with minor negative events. The current study extends prior research examining the kindling model in BD using a methodologically rigorous assessment of life stressors and mood episode occurrence.

55,Background: Bipolar disorder is a common chronic illness characterized by high levels of morbidity and all-cause mortality. Lithium is one of the gold standard mood stabilizer treatments. but the identification of good. partial and non-responders in clinical settings is inconsistent. Methods: We used an established rating scale (the Alda scale) to classify the degree of lithium response (good response. partial response. non-response) in a large. multicentre clinically representative sample of well-characterized cases of bipolar disorders I and II. Next. we examined previously reported clinical predictors of response to determine which factors significantly differentiated between the three response groups. Results: Of 754 cases. 300 received lithium. for at least 6months. as a treatment for bipolar disorder (40%). Of these cases. 17% were classified as good response. 52% as partial response and 31% as non-response. Lifetime history of mixed episodes (p=0.017) and alcohol use disorders (p=0.015) both occurred in >20% of partial response and non-response groups but <10% of good response cases. Family history of bipolar disorder I was of borderline statistical significance. being more frequent in the good response group (38%) compared with the non-response group (18%). There was a trend (p=0.06) for bipolar disorder II to be associated with non-response. Conclusions: Only three factors previously identified as predictors of lithium response significantly differentiated the response groups identified in our sample. Interestingly. these factors have all been found to co-occur more often than expected by chance. and it can be hypothesized that they may represent a shared underlying factor or dimension. Further prospective studies of predictors and the performance of the Alda scale are recommended....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Bipolar Disorder
56,Background: The relationship between Toxoplasma gondii infection and the development of bipolar disorder (BD) has long been investigated. yet to date it is still poorly understood and documented. The aim of this review is to derive a summary estimate of the strength of the association between infection with T. gondii and BD from the available published studies. Methods: A systematic review was performed using PubMed. LILACS. PsycINFO. and Embase databases. Studies which included a proportion of seropositive BD patients and controls were further examined in a meta analysis. Results: One hundred eighteen citations were initially retrieved. Thirteen studies were included in our systematic review. Eight out of these thirteen studies were included in our meta-analysis. Statistical analyses showed that T. gondii infection is associated with with BD (OR=1.26). Limitations: Small sample size was the major limitation among the studies that carried out serological analyses. In addition. the available studies did not have enough information on disease status/severity or type of bipolar disorder. Also. it was not possible to analyze pregnancy status or perinatal infection. Future studies addressing the aforementioned topics are clearly needed. Conclusions: Despite heterogeneous results. patients with BD are more likely to be infected by T. gondii than controls. Early T. gondii infection might predispose the development of BD. T.gondii infection is becoming clinically relevant in psychiatric disorders and future mechanistic studies are required to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Bipolar Disorder
57,Sleep disruptions represent a core feature of bipolar disorders and have been widely studied through the use of actigraphy. which is an objective measure of motor activity and sleep. Finding objective outcomes. which reliably measure sleep in bipolar disorders. is essential in developing better therapies and improving follow-up monitoring strategies. Our aim is to understand the role of actigraphy as an objective measure of sleep in bipolar disorder. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis on studies using actigraphy to detect changes in activity and sleep patterns in bipolar patients versus healthy controls. The primary outcome measures were the analyses of 'activity mean' and 'sleep duration'. As secondary outcomes we analysed 'sleep onset latency'. 'sleep efficiency'. and 'time awake after sleep onset'. Thirteen studies comprising 821 subjects met quality criteria for inclusion. The results show a decrease in activity mean and an altered pattern of sleep in bipolar patients. Further analyses suggest that the results might be generalized to a bipolar condition which underlies manic and depressed episodes as well as euthymic phases. This study highlights the role of actigraphy as an important objective tool for the ambulatory monitoring of sleep and activity in bipolar disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

58,Background. The different patterns of Emotional Intelligence (EI) deficits in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are are not yet well understood. This study compares EI levels among these groups and highlights the potential impact of non-social cognition on EI. Method. Fifty-eight schizophrenia and 60 bipolar outpatients were investigated using the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) and the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS). Analyses of covariance were performed with adjustment for the BACS composite score. Results. Compared to bipolar subjects. schizophrenia patients showed significantly lower levels in both EI and nonsocial cognition. After adjustment for the BACS composite score. the difference in EI was lost. The mediation analysis revealed that differences between schizophrenia and bipolar patients in strategic EI are almost fully attributable to the mediating effect of non-social cognition. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that in both schizophrenia and bipolar patients EI is strongly influenced by nonsocial cognitive functioning. This has to be taken into account when interpreting MSCEIT data in comparative studies in serious mental illness and emphasizes the importance of cognitive remediation....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Schizophrenia
59,The degradation of LM124J operational amplifier under the gamma-irradiation is studied for different dose rates and temperatures during irradiation. The results show that degradation of studied devices due to total ionizing dose effects continues to increase significantly. if the dose rate decreases below 0.01 rad(Si)/s. that is not typical for the most of bipolar devices. It can complicate the use of criteria of enhanced low dose rate sensitivity (ELDRS). which are defined by existing standards for radiation tests. The paper shows how to take into account such effects during radiation testing considering ELDRS....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Operational amplifier
60,Objective: Bipolar disorder (BD) is highly heritable. Neuroimaging studies comparing unaffected youth at high familial risk for BD (i.e.. those with a first-degree relative with the disorder; termed "high-risk" [HR]) to "low-risk" (LR) youth (i.e.. those without a first-degree relative with BD) and to patients with BD may help identify potential brain-based markers associated with risk (i.e.. regions where BR+BD not equal LR). resilience (HR not equal BD+LR). or illness (BD not equal HR+LR). Method: During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 99 youths (i.e.. adolescents and young adults) aged 9.8 to 24.8 years (36 BD. 22 HR. 41 LR) performed a task probing face emotion labeling. previously shown to be impaired behaviorally in youth with BD and HR youth. Results: We found three patterns of results. Candidate risk endophenotypes (i.e.. where BD and HR shared deficits) included dysfunction in higher-order face processing regions (e.g.. middle temporal gyrus. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Candidate resilience markers and disorder sequelae (where HR and BD. respectively. show unique alterations relative to the other two groups) included different patterns of neural responses across other regions mediating face processing (e.g.. fusiform). executive function (e.g.. inferior frontal gyrus). and social cognition (e.g.. default network. superior temporal sulcus. temporoparietal junction). Conclusion: If replicated in longitudinal studies and with additional populations. neural patterns suggesting risk endophenotypes could be used to identify individuals at risk for BD who may benefit from prevention measures. Moreover. information about risk and resilience markers could be used to develop novel treatments that recruit neural markers of resilience and attenuate neural patterns associated with risk....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Bipolar Disorder
61,Urban habitats are described as having an overall negative influence on many fitness-related traits in several bird species. but a vital function such as immunity remains poorly studied. The immune response is strongly linked to individual condition. which partly depends on resource availability and the parasitic context that often differ between urban and natural habitats. A difference between the immunity of populations dwelling in urban areas and populations from more natural habitats can. therefore. be hypothesized. We conducted a 2-year experimental study on great tits (Parus major) in urban and forest areas. We stimulated the constitutive immunity of nestlings and assessed both the inflammatory response by measuring the plasma levels of haptoglobin. an inflammatory marker. and its activation cost through the loss of body mass. In addition. we checked the nestlings for ectoparasites and assessed haemosporidian prevalence in adults. Nestlings from urban sites produced relatively less haptoglobin and lost more body mass than those from forest sites. which suggests that the activation of constitutive immunity is more costly for birds living in urban sites than for those living in the forest. We detected no ectoparasite in birds in both habitats. However. urban adults showed lower haemosporidian prevalence than forest ones. suggesting a reduced exposure to these parasites and their vectors in towns. Overall. our study provides evidence for an immune difference between urban and forest populations. Because immunity is crucial for organism fitness. it is of prime interest to identify causes and processes at the origin of this difference....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Outdoor Health
62,Introducing an animal into a new location could be hazardous in the form of disease transmission. especially with respect to infections that are often overlooked. Such introduced infectious agents. including parasitic ones. then pose potential danger to the native animal population. Within the conservation program. the European bison was introduced into many European countries. However. this largest European herbivore was recognized as a new host for an invasive parasitic nematode. Ashworthius sidemi. in Poland in 1998. Since then. the prevalence of this non-native parasite in Poland has increased not only in bison but also in other wild ruminants. In 2011 five European bison individuals were transported from Poland to the Czech Republic. In the current study. we examined the gastrointestinal tracts of two European bison and two red deer culled in the Z. idlov game reserve. A. sidemi was identified in all investigated animals using both morphological and molecular methods; infection intensity was higher in bison than in deer. Our findings represent the first record of this invasive parasite in European bison at the Czech territory. The results of this study indicate changes in epidemiological patterns of Ashworthius infections in the climatic condition of Central Europe as well as the need to verify the reliability of ashworthiosis intravital diagnostics. One can expect A. sidemi to spread gradually in the Czech Republic and colonize other native ruminant hosts....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Fungal Infection
63,In the present study. sediment was spiked with bisphenol A (BPA) solution to explore the interaction between indigenous bacterial communities and BPA biodegradation in sediment. Results showed that BPA could be adsorbed to the sediment and then biodegraded rapidly. Biodegradation efficiency of BPA in treatments with 10 and 50 mg/L BPA reached 64.3 and 61.8% on the first day. respectively. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that BPA affected the densities. species. and diversities of bacteria significantly. The response of bacterial community to BPA favored BPA biodegradation by promoting the growth of BPA-reducing bacteria and inhibiting other competitors. According to the results of sequencing. Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas played vital roles in the degradation of BPA. They presented over 73% of the original bacterial community. and both of them were promoted by BPA comparing with controls. Laccase and polyphenol oxidase contributed to the degradation of BPA and metabolic intermediates. respectively. This paper illustrates the rapid biodegradation of BPA induced by the response of indigenous bacterial communities to the BPA stress. which will improve the understandings of BPA degradation in sediment....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Enzymology
64,Aberrant expression of EPH receptors and their ligands. ephrins. has been reported in a large variety of human cancers. including epithelial cancers from the colon and ovary. Due to the recently reported decrease or loss of EPHBs expression in colorectal carcinomas and the abundance of CpG sites in their promoters. we analyzed the promoter methylation status of three members of the EPHB family. EPHB2. EPHB3 and EPHB4. in a series of 22 colon cancer cell lines. as well as in four ovarian cancer cell lines and 56 ovarian tumor samples. The promoters of the three receptor genes were unmethylated in the vast majority of samples as assessed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). These results were confirmed by direct bisulphite sequencing. Furthermore. from RT-PCR analyzes and Northern blotting. EPHB2 showed only small variation in RNA expression across ovarian cancer cell lines and clinical samples. We conclude that promoter hypermethylation of EPHB2. EPHB3 and EPHB4 is not a common event in colon and ovarian cancers and therefore plays no major role in these tumors....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Cancer
65,Children represent a population at risk. because of their short size. their naivety and their attraction to animals. The face and hands are the most specific locations in young children. Wounds are often multiple. In more than half the cases. the child knows the animal. which are dogs and cats by frequency argument. The bite episode occurs mostly when the child is alone with the pet without direct supervision. while playing or stroking the animal. As in all bites. pediatric lesions are infectious. functional and aesthetic emergencies. but the goal of this work was primarily to make a point on principles of surgical management of animal bites in children. highlighting pediatric specificities. Animal bites require psychological. anesthetic and surgical treatment. adapted to the child. in a specialized structure. Hospitalization and general anesthesia are more frequent in children. Any suspicion of mistreatment (and/or abuse) should lead to the child's hospitalization. even if wounds do not justify monitoring in a surgical environment. Emergency surgery is essential to limit functional and aesthetic consequences. The healing capacities of the child and the frequent lack of co-morbidity allow a conservative surgical treatment with suture. repositioning skin flaps and controlled healing in the first place. Immobilization. drainage. and antibiotics will complete the surgery. The healing process. however. leads to a specific management during scar remodeling phase and growth. Psychological care of the child and parents should not be forgotten. and has to start at the same time as surgical treatment at in acute phase. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

66,BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) was isolated in 1971 from the urine of a kidney transplant patient. Soon after its identification. BKPyV was characterized as a kidney-tropic virus. which is responsible of a significant fraction of the rejection of transplant kidney in the host. Moreover. in experimental conditions. BKPyV is able to transform different types of animal and human cells and to induce tumors of different histotypes in experimental animals. BKPyV DNA sequences have been detected in healthy individuals and cancer patients using polymerase chain reaction/Shouthern blot hybridization methods. Serum antibodies against this polyomavirus were revealed using immunological techniques. which. however. cross-react with other polyomaviruses such as JC (JCPyV) and Simian Virus 40. These non-specific data indicate the need of novel immunological methods and new investigations to check in a specific manner. BKPyV spread in humans. To this aim. mimotopes from BKPyV structural capsid protein 1 (VP1) were employed for specific immunological reactions to IgG antibodies of human serum samples. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with synthetic peptides mimicking immunogenic epitopes of BKPyV VP1 was set up and employed to test sera of healthy adult subjects. Data from this innovative immunological assay indicate that serum antibodies against BKPyV VP1 mimotopes are detectable in healthy subjects ranging from 18 to 90 years old. The overall prevalence of serum samples that reacted to BKPyV VP1 mimotopes was 72%. The strong points from this investigation are the novelty of the immunological method. its simplicity of the approach. and the specificity of BKPyV antibody reaction to VP1 mimotopes....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Kidney Health
67,Infections and malignancies are the expected complications of immunosuppressive therapy. which non-specifically impairs cellular and humoral immune responses in renal transplant recipients. Infections were usually frequent and severe during the early post-transplant period (first year). Recent diagnostic methods (molecular biology) and availability of new antivirals. antifungal and. antibiotic drugs made rapid diagnosis and systematic preventive strategies much easier and this resulted in a significant reduction of infections and infectious death in this population. However. new infectious agents like BK polyomavirus. hepatitis E virus. parvovirus (as well as Chigunkunya. West Nile and others in particular areas) were recently recognized as responsible of aggressive infections in the immunocompromised host. Malignancies are also common after transplantation. due to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression. Skin cancers and lymphoproliferative disorders are the most common and are undoubtedly caused by viral infections. but incidence of non-skin cancers is also increased. After reduction of immunosuppression. treatment is similar to non-transplant patients: Results are usually poor and cancer is now the third cause of death in transplant recipients. Due to their anti-proliferative and anti-tumoral properties. incidence of de novo cancer significantly decreased in patients receiving mTor inhibitors as maintenance immunosuppression; furthermore. in patients already diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma or recurrent skin cancers. introduction of mTor was associated with stabilisation and/or regression of malignant lesions.

68,Objective: The purpose of the present. prospective. cohort study was to monitor urine cytology samples from recipients of renal transplants to search for the occurrence of decoy cells and degenerated inclusion-bearing cells with an aim to correlate the existence of these cells with molecular detection of polyomavirus BK (BKV) DNA in urine. Material and methods: This study included patients who underwent renal transplantation. Patients had their urine tested quarterly. during the first year post-transplantation. for the presence of decoy cells and degenerated cells. as well as by quantitative determination of BKV load in the urine and plasma. Results: Three hundred and sixty-one examinations were performed on 101 patients within 12 months of attendance. Urine cytology results were: 198 (54.9%) negative and 60 (16.6%) positive for the presence of viral cytopathic effects depending on the presence of BKV infection. 72 (19.9%) positive for the manifestation of degenerated cells and 31 (8.6%) unsatisfactory for analysis. There was a subtle tendency towards the presence of degenerated inclusion-bearing cells in cases in which the virus was detected in voided urine. However. the presence of degenerated cells exhibited a tendency to BKV positivity in months 3. 6 and 9 and. exclusively in month 12. this trend was statistically significant. Conclusions: There were not enough strong morphological and staining elements to state the origin of the degenerated cells or to describe the nature of the infection (viral or bacterial). given that these cells were undergoing an apoptotic process in post renal transplant patients....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Kidney Health
69,Background. Although trichinellosis is known to cause thrombotic disease. serious thrombotic events are rare and have not been previously associated with Trichinella nativa infection. Methods. Patient interviews and medical chart reviews were conducted on 10 men who became ill following consumption of a common source of black bear meat. Trichinella serology on patient sera as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and larval identification of the meat samples was conducted. Results. All 10 exposed individuals developed an acute illness clinically compatible with trichinellosis. characterized by fever. abdominal pain. and diarrhea. along with eosinophilia ranging from 0.9 x 10(9)/L to 6.1 x 10(9)/L. Within 2 weeks of the diarrheal illness. systemic symptoms developed in all exposed individuals characterized by fever. myalgia. periorbital edema. and fatigue. ST-elevation myocardial infarction and sinus venous tract thrombosis occurred as a complication of trichinellosis in 2 patients. Acute serology was nonreactive in all patients. though convalescent serology was reactive in 6 of 8 (75%) patients for whom sera was available. Multiplex PCR identified T. nativa from the bear meat. and was corroborated by microscopic larval identification. Conclusions. We report a 100% attack rate of T. nativa from bear meat among those who were exposed. and demonstrate that this species can cause serious thrombotic complications of trichinellosis in humans.

70,Black rot. caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Pammel) Dowson (Xcc). is one of the most damaging diseases of cauliflower and other crucifers. In order to investigate the molecular resistance mechanisms and to find the genes related to black rot resistance in cauliflower. a suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA library was constructed using resistant line C712 and its susceptible near-isogenic line C731 as tester and driver. respectively. A total of 280 clones were obtained from the library by reverse northern blotting. Sequencing analysis and homology searching showed that these clones represent 202 unique sequences. The library included many defense/disease-resistant related genes. such as plant defensin gene PDF1.2. lipid transfer protein. thioredoxin h. Gene expression profiles of 12 genes corresponding to different functional categories were monitored by real-time RT-PCR. The results showed that the expression induction of these genes in the susceptible line C712 in response to Xcc was quicker and more intense. while in C731 the reaction was delayed and limited. Our results imply that these up-regulated genes might be involved in cauliflower responses against Xcc infection. Information obtained from this study could be used to understand the molecular mechanisms of disease response in cauliflower under Xcc stress....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
71,Instrumental test of black tea samples instead of human panel test is attracting massive attention recently. This study focused on an investigation of the feasibility for estimation of the color sensory quality of black tea samples using the VIS-NIR spectroscopy technique. comparing the performances of models based on the spectra and color information. In model calibration. the variables were first selected by genetic algorithm (GA); then the nonlinear back propagation-artificial neural network (BPANN) models were established based on the optimal variables. In comparison with the other models. GA-BPANN models from spectra data information showed the best performance. with the correlation coefficient of 0.8935. and the root mean square error of 0392 in the prediction set. In addition. models based on the spectra information provided better performance than that based on the color parameters. Therefore. the VIS-NIR spectroscopy technique is a promising tool for rapid and accurate evaluation of the sensory quality of black tea samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

72,Possible altered gene expression patterns in bladder tumour carcinogenesis in rat bladder cancers induced by BBN [N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine] was examined by cDNA microarray analysis of gene expression profiles. Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were given drinking water containing 0.05% BBN ad libitum for 24 to 28 weeks. Equal numbers of control rats were given tap water without BBN. After treatment. the rat bladders were excised for RNA extraction and histopathological examinations. Total RNAs were extracted from rat transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) tissues and micro-dissected normal rat bladder epithelia. The atlas glass rat microarray was used. which included oligonucleotides of 1081 rat genes. Some of the up-regulated genes in rat bladder TCCs were further confirmed by Northern blotting. Our results showed that the transcriptions of 30 genes were significantly elevated in the rat bladder TCCs. and these included fly proto-oncogene. Lipocortin 2. COX IV. COX V a. and cathepsin D. Also. 15 genes were significantly down-regulated in the rat bladder TCCs and they included B7.1. TNFr1. APOA1 and VHL. The results of cDNA microarray analysis demonstrated that normal rat bladder epithelia and bladder TCC exhibited different and specific gene statement profiles. The increased expressions of the identified genes may play an important role in the chemically induced bladder carcinogenesis....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Cancer
73,To date. molecular evidence studies for bladder cancer. using the microarray technology. are focusing on the transitional cell carcinoma. however. similar fingerprinting studies have rarely been performed on the other molecular phenotypes of bladder cancer. squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This study was conducted to monitor the gene expression profiles for bilharzial-related SCC of the bladder to be able to compare its data with transitional cell carcinoma microarray data. A total of 17 paired bilharzial urinary bladder SCC specimens and their corresponding normal urothelium were analyzed using the complementary deoxyribonucleic acid microarray hybridization approach to study the molecular basis of the development of SCC of the urinary bladder. Validation of the microarray results was performed using the Northern blotting technique. After supervised analysis of the microarray data. there was at least a 3-fold difference in the expression between SCC of the bladder and normal urothelium in 82 genes. A total of 38 genes were up-regulated in SCC of the bladder. including matrix degradation-related genes. growth factors. different oncogenes. and immunology related genes. Conversely. 44 genes were down-regulated in SCC of the bladder. including integrins. laminins. cadherins. nonmetastatic cell 1 (NM23) and apoptosis-related genes. Our findings can explain the aggressive behavior of SCC of the bladder. Such gene profiling studies will add to our understanding of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis. and may also improve our ability to diagnose and treat bladder cancer. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

75,Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B is a type 1 transmembrane protein that has been recently found to play a role in cancer cell proliferation. angiogenesis. and invasion. Due to its potential responsibility in cancer aggressiveness. the main objective of this work was to investigate its expression in bladder cancer and the biological functions in bladder cancer cells. Using immunohistochemistry. western blot. and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. we analyzed the expression of glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B in bladder cancer tissues and bladder cancer cell lines. The effects of glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B on proliferation. migration. and invasion were tested after knocking down the glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B in bladder cancer cells with small interfering RNAs by CCK-8. Transwell. and Matrigel assays. Our results showed that glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B protein was highly expressed in the bladder cancer tissues and cell lines. Downregulating glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B could suppress the proliferation. migration. and invasion in bladder cancer cells. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B expression was related to the poor differentiation and recurrence by immunohistochemistry analysis. The survival analysis also showed that glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B was related to the patient prognosis. In conclusion. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B protein was highly expressed in the bladder cancer. which was related to the poor prognosis in bladder cancer patients. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B promoted the proliferation. migration. and invasion in bladder cancer cells....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
76,We sought to identify and validate a novel urinary autophagy transcript signature in patients with bladder cancer and evaluate its clinical utility. We performed an initial screening for seven autophagy transcript-based panel (autophagy-related protein 12 (ATG12); WD repeat domain. phosphoinositide interacting 2 (WIPI2); FYVE and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 1 (FYCO1); microtubule-associated protein light chain (MAPLC3); RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1 (RB1CC1); tachylectin-II-like beta-propeller domain 1 (TECPR1); and Unc-51-like kinase (ULK1)) that was identified based on bioinformatics analysis followed by SYBR Green-based polymerase chain reaction array validation in paired tissue and urine samples. Afterward. we evaluated the expression of differentially expressed autophagy transcripts in an independent validation set with reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in urine sediments of 140 patients with bladder cancer. 68 patients with benign urological lesions. and 74 healthy controls (age and sex matched). The expression levels of ATG12. FYCO1. TECPR1. and ULK1 in paired bladder tissue and urine samples were significantly lower in bladder cancer than in control group (p < 0.001). In the validation set. the receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated that each urinary autophagy transcripts showed high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing bladder cancer from non-bladder cancer patients (ATG12. 75.4% and 86.1%; FYCO1. 87% and 75.7%; ULK1. 85.5% and 75.6%; and TECPR1. 90% and 81.9%).

77,Background: Bladder cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite recent advances in understanding its molecular biology. the 5-year survival for muscle-invasive disease (muscle-invasive bladder cancer [MIBC]) remains approximately 50%. Although neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) offers an established 5% absolute survival benefit at 5 years. only the 40% of patients with a major tumor response appear to benefit. There remains. therefore. a critical unmet need for predictive markers to determine which patients are best managed with NAC. as well as for novel targeted therapies to overcome resistance to NAC. Methods: The NAC paradigm offers the optimal clinical context for developing precision therapy for MIBC. Abundant tissue is available for analysis before NAC in all patients and after NAC in patients with residual MIBC. Technologic advances have enabled next-generation sequencing and gene expression microarray analysis of routinely collected and even archived tissue specimens. These technologies provide a foundation for the identification of markers of chemoresistance and for the development of rational cotargeting strategies. Results: Modern computational methods allow for some measure of target validation. which can be enhanced by the use of patient-derived primary xenografts (PDX). These PDX can be established at the time of radical cystectomy after NAC if there is residual MIBC. By the time a patient recurs clinically. candidate drugs targeting specific molecular changes in the patient tumor and corresponding PDX would have been tested in the PDX model. and only the most efficacious drug(s) would be administered to the patient. Liquid biopsies in the form of circulating tumor DNA and circulating tumor cells allow noninvasive longitudinal monitoring of the molecular landscape of an advanced tumor as it is being treated with successive courses of systemic therapy. Conclusions: These tools combined form the foundation of an evidence-based precision oncology strategy for MIBC. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

78,Objective: This study examined symptom reporting related to the 10th Edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) criteria for postconcussional syndrome (PCS) in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) Veterans. Our aims were to: (a) examine relationships among PCS symptoms by identifying potential subscales of the British Columbia Postconcussion Symptom Inventory (BC-PSI); and (b) examine group differences in BC-PSI items and subscales in Veterans with and without blast exposure. mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method: Our sample included Veterans with blast-related mTBI history (n=47). with blast exposure but no mTBI history (n=20). and without blast exposure (n=23). Overall. 37 Veterans had PTSD. and 53 did not. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the BC-PSI followed by multivariate analysis of variance to examine differences in BC-PSI subscale scores by blast exposure. mTBI history. and PTSD. Results: BC-PSI factors were interpreted as cognitive. vestibular. affective. anger. and somatic. Items and factor scores were highest for Veterans with blast exposure plus mTBI. and lowest for controls. Vestibular. affective. and somatic factors were significantly higher for Veterans with blast exposure plus mTBI than for controls. but not significantly different for those with blast exposure but no mTBI. These results remained significant when PTSD symptom severity was included as a covariate. Cognitive. anger. and somatic subscales were significantly higher for Veterans with PTSD. though there was no interaction effect of PTSD and mTBI or blast history. Conclusions: EFA-derived subscales of the BC-PSI differentiated Veterans based on blast exposure. mTBI history. and PTSD....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Mental Health
79,The extraction of molten iron and slag in the liquid phase from the lower part of a blast furnace (hearth) is usually accomplished according to operational experience and involves a high degree of uncertainty. mainly because the liquid level cannot be directly measured. This study presents a methodology for obtaining multistep models to forecast the hearth liquid level by measuring a voltage generated on the blast furnace shell. which is strongly correlated with the hearth liquid level. The results show that this electrical signal is a nonstationary and nonlinear time-series that. after appropriate treatment. can be represented by a time-delay neural network (TDNN) model. Some comparisons are made with linear time-series models represented by an autoregressive moving average model and a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model. and the results indicate that the TDNN model provides better forecasting performance up to one hour ahead. Note to Practitioners-This work was motivated by the need for better knowledge regarding the liquid level in a blast furnace hearth because this information affects the strategy of the opening and closing of tapholes in the blast furnace and. consequently. the production control and operational quality. Due to the difficulties of measuring the liquid level in the hearth directly. a system was installed that uses a voltage generated in the hearth shell as a liquid-level sensor in the hearth. In this study. the analysis and treatment of this signal is performed by achieving a stationary. nonlinear signal strongly correlated with the level of molten iron and slag inside the blast furnace hearth. A mathematical model that represents this signal was developed and implemented online in the blast furnace digital control system to enable forecasting of the liquid level up to one hour ahead. This computational tool aids operators and engineers in deciding in advance the instants to open or close the tapholes. thereby increasing safety and financial gains....,ECE,CS,Digital control,Machine learning
80,The aims of this study were to observe the effects of vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) with three different negative pressures on the wound healing rate. macrophage count and the expression of hyaluronic acid (HA) as well as its receptor CD44 in seawater-immersed blast-injury wounds (SIBIW) and to determine the optimal negative pressure value. In a minipig SIBIW model. different suction pressures and routine dressing were applied. Histological and immunohistochemical comparisons as well as molecular biology methods were performed to compare the wound healing conditions. macrophage count and the levels of HA and CD44. The wound healing rate of the VSD group was significantly higher than that of the control group. with the -120 mmHg group exhibiting the best effects. The macrophage count of the VSD group was higher than that of the control group. The HA level fluctuation was higher in the VSD group. with the -120 mmHg and the -180 mmHg groups showing the most significant fluctuation (P < 005). CD44 was expressed in the full-thickness wound-limbic tissues and was higher in the treatment group than that in the control group. with the -120 mmHg group having the most obvious expression. VSD significantly improved the healing ability and increased the macrophage count and the HA content. It also promoted CD44 expression. -120 mmHg is the optimal negative pressure value....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Skin Care
81,Blastocystis. a genetically diverse intestinal parasite with controversial pathogenic potential. has increasingly been incriminated for diarrheal illness in immunocompromised individuals including colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The aim of the current study was to assess the possible association between Blastocystis infection and CRC condition in Makkah. Saudi Arabia (KSA). Methods: Stool samples were collected from 80 non-cancer (NC) and 138 cancer subjects including 74 CRC patients and 64 patients with other cancers outside gastrointestinal tract (COGT). Molecularly confirmed Blastocystis isolates were genetically grouped and subtyped using multiplex polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and sequence-tagged site primers-based PCR (PCR-STS). respectively. Results: Blastocystis hominis were confirmed in 29.7. 25 and 15% among CRC. COGT and NC patients. respectively. Obtained Blastocystis isolates were initially categorized into 2 groups (A and C). which were subsequently subtyped into 3 different subtypes; subtype-I (38%). subtype-II (44%) and subtype-V (22%). Interestingly. subtype-I was the most predominantly detected subtype (54.5%) among CRC patients with a significant association risk (COR 7.548; 95% CI: 1.629-34.987; P = 0.004). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge. the current study is the first to provide genetic insights on the prevalence of Blastocystis hominis among CRC patients in Makkah. KSA. Moreover. the study suggests for a possible association between subtype-I of Blastocystis hominis and CRC. which could indicate a potential influence of Blastocystis on CRC condition. Further studies are required to confirm this association risk and to investigate the possible underlying mechanism of postulated carcinogenic influence of Blastocystis hominis subtype-I....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
82,Purpose of review In the last nine decades. large advances have been made toward the characterization of the pathogenic basis and clinical management of von Willebrand disease (VWD). the most prevalent inherited bleeding disorder. Pathological variations at the von Willebrand factor (VWF) locus present as a range of both quantitative and qualitative abnormalities that make up the complex clinical spectrum of VWD. This review describes the current understanding of the pathobiological basis of VWD. Recent findings The molecular basis of type 2 (qualitative abnormalities) and type 3 VWD (total quantitative deficiency) have been well characterized in recent decades. However. knowledge of type 1 VWD (partial quantitative deficiency) remains incomplete because of the allelic and locus heterogeneity of this trait. and is complicated by genetic variability at the VWF gene. interactions between the VWF gene and the environment. and the involvement of external modifying loci. Recent genome wide association studies and linkage analyses have sought to identify additional genes that modify the type 1 VWD phenotype. Summary Understanding the pathogenic basis of VWD will facilitate the development of novel treatment regimens for this disorder. and improve the ability to provide complementary molecular diagnostics for type 1 VWD....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Hereditary Angioedema
83,The objective was to investigate a family from Argentina. The proposita was a 51-year-old woman who had a moderate bleeding tendency. Some of her children showed a mild bleeding tendency. Her mother and the husband were asymptomatic. Clotting. immunological and molecular biology techniques were used. Partial thromboplastin. prothrombin. Russell Viper venom-clotting times were moderately prolonged in the proposita. whereas they were slightly prolonged in the children and in her mother. Factor X (FX) activity was about 2-3% of normal in all assay systems. FX antigen was less than 5%. Other clotting factors and platelet were normal. Genetic analysis showed a compound heterozygosis: combination of a 'new' mutation (Gln138Arg) with an already known mutation (Glu350Lys). The children had intermediate FX levels (35-63% of normal) and were carriers of one of the two mutations present in the proposita. This is the first observation of a FX deficiency in Argentina.

85,Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. michiganensis (Cmm) causes substantial economic losses in tomato production worldwide. The disease symptoms observed in plants infected systemically by Cmm are wilting and canker on the stem. whereas blister-like spots develop in locally infected leaves. A wide repertoire of serine proteases and cell wall-degrading enzymes has been implicated in the development of wilt and canker symptoms. However. virulence factors involved in the formation of blister-like spots. which play an important role in Cmm secondary spread in tomato nurseries. are largely unknown. Here. we demonstrate that Cmm virulence factors play different roles during blister formation relative to wilting. Inoculation with a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labelled Cmm382 indicates that penetration occurs mainly through trichomes. When spray inoculated on tomato leaves. the wild-type Cmm382 and Cmm100 (lacking plasmids pCM1 and pCM2) strains form blister-like spots on leaves. whereas Cmm27 (lacking the chp/tomA pathogenicity island) is non-pathogenic. indicating that plasmid-borne genes. which have a crucial role in wilting. are not required for blister formation. Conversely. mutations in chromosomal genes encoding serine proteases (chpC and sbtA). cell wall-degrading enzymes (pgaA and endX/Y). a transcriptional regulator (vatr2). a putative perforin (perF) and a putative sortase (srtA) significantly affect disease incidence and the severity of blister formation. The transcript levels of these genes. as measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. showed that. during blister formation. they are expressed early at 8-16 h after inoculation. whereas. during wilting. they are expressed after 24-72 h or expressed at low levels. Plant gene expression studies suggest that chpC is involved in the suppression of host defence....,biochemistry,CS,Polymerase chain reaction,Computer vision
86,DNA nanotechnology enables the synthesis of nanometer-sized objects that can be site-specifically functionalized with a large variety of materials. For these reasons. DNA-based devices such as DNA origami are being considered for applications in molecular biology and nanomedicine. However. many DNA structures need a higher ionic strength than that of common cell culture buffers or bodily fluids to maintain their integrity and can be degraded quickly by nucleases. To overcome these deficiencies. we coated several different DNA origami structures with a cationic poly(ethylene glycol)-polylysine block copolymer. which electrostatically covered the DNA nanostructures to form DNA origami polyplex micelles (DOPMs). This straightforward. cost-effective. and robust route to protect DNA-based structures could therefore enable applications in biology and nanomedicine where unprotected DNA origami would be degraded....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Molecular biology
87,Canine brucellosis caused by Brucella canis is a neglected zoonosis worldwide and is a leading cause of reproductive failure in dogs. often causing substantial economic losses in breeding kennels. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of B.canis infection in dogs of commercial breeding kennels located in SAo Paulo State. Brazil. A total of 753 dogs (183 males and 570 females) from 38 commercial kennels were clinically examined. and blood samples were collected for brucellosis diagnosis through blood culture. The association between clinical manifestations suggestive of brucellosis and positive results through blood culture was determined. Of the 753 dogs tested. 166 (22.0%) had at least one clinical sign suggestive of brucellosis and 158 (20.9%) had positive blood cultures. Seventy-two dogs had positive blood culture and had at least one clinical sign suggestive of brucellosis. while 91 dogs showed at least one clinical manifestation suggestive of brucellosis although blood culture was negative. Of the 38 kennels. 16 (42.1%) had at least one positive dog. The prevalence of infection in each kennel varied from 3.8% to 62.6%. Abortion/stillbirth. failure to conceive and enlargement of lymph nodes were significantly associated with brucellosis in female. No association of clinical signs and positive results in blood culture was observed in males. None of the kennels has been carrying out programmes to control brucellosis. and the sale of infected dogs was considered a common practice yielding risks to the public health. in view of the zoonotic potential of the infection....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,HIV/AIDS

89,Eccentric exercise training is effective for increasing muscle mass and strength. and improving insulin sensitivity and blood lipid profiles. However. potential muscle damage symptoms such as prolonged loss of muscle function and delayed onset of muscle soreness may restrict the use of eccentric exercise. especially in clinical populations. Therefore. strategies to reduce eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) are necessary. and an extensive number of scientific studies have tried to identify potential intervention modalities to perform eccentric exercises without adverse effects. The present paper is based on a narrative review of current literature. and provides a novel hypothesis by which an ischemic preconditioning (IPC) of the extremities may reduce EIMD. IPC consists of an intermittent application of short time non-lethal ischemia to an extremity (e.g. using a tourniquet) followed by reperfusion and was discovered in clinical settings in an attempt to minimize inflammatory responses induced by ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion-injury (I/R-Injury) during surgery. The present hypothesis is based on morphological and biochemical similarities in the pathophysiology of skeletal muscle damage during clinical surgery and EIMD. Even though the primary origin of stress differs between I/R-Injury and EIMD. subsequent cellular alterations characterized by an intracellular accumulation of Ca2+. an increased production of reactive oxygen species or increased apoptotic signaling are essential elements for both. Moreover. the incipient immune response appears to be similar in I/R-Injury and EIMD. which is indicated by an infiltration of leukocytes into the damaged soft-tissue. Thus far. IPC is considered as a potential intervention strategy in the area of cardiovascular or orthopedic surgery and provides significant impact on soft-tissue protection and downregulation of undesired excessive inflammation induced by I/R-Injury. Based on the known major impact of IPC on skeletal muscle physiology and immunology. the present paper aims to illustrate the potential protective effects of IPC on EIMD by discussing possible underlying mechanisms.

90,Objective-Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with the premature development of cardiovascular disease. The platelet-endothelium interaction is important in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. In this study. we investigated the platelet phenotype from patients with SLE and matched controls. and their effect on endothelial cells. Approach and Results-Platelet aggregability was measured in 54 SLE subjects off antiplatelet therapy (mean age 40.112.8 years; 82% female; 37% white) with age- and sex-matched controls. Platelets were coincubated with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and changes to gene expression assessed by an RNA array and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. SLE disease activity index ranged from 0 to 22 (mean 5.1 +/- 3.9). Compared with controls. patients with SLE had significantly increased monocyte and leukocyte-platelet aggregation and platelet aggregation in response to submaximal agonist stimulation. An agnostic microarray of HUVECs cocultured with SLE platelets found a platelet-mediated effect on endothelial gene pathways involved in cell activation. Sera from SLE versus control subjects significantly increased (1) activation of control platelets; (2) platelet adhesion to HUVECs; (3) platelet-induced HUVEC gene expression of interleukin-8. and intercellular adhesion molecule 1; and (4) proinflammatory gene expression in HUVECs. mediated by interleukin-1-dependent pathway. Incubation of SLE-activated platelets with an interleukin-1-neutralizing antibody or HUVECs pretreated with interleukin-1 receptor antibodies attenuated the platelet-mediated activation of endothelial cells. Conclusions-Platelet activity measurements and subsequent interleukin-1-dependent activation of the endothelium are increased in subjects with SLE. Platelet-endothelial interactions may play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in patients with SLE....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Heart Disease
91,We previously reported the secretion of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) from vascular endothelial cells and proposed the existence of a vascular natriuretic peptide system composed of endothelial CNP and smooth muscle guanylyl cyclase-B (GC-B). the CNP receptor. and involved in the regulation of vascular tone. remodeling. and regeneration. In this study. we assessed the functional significance of this system in the regulation of blood pressure in vivo using vascular endothelial cell-specific CNP knockout and vascular smooth muscle cell-specific GC-B knockout mice. These mice showed neither the skeletal abnormality nor the early mortality observed in systemic CNP or GC-B knockout mice. Endothelial cell-specific CNP knockout mice exhibited significantly increased blood pressures and an enhanced acute hypertensive response to nitric oxide synthetase inhibition. Acetylcholine-induced. endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was impaired in rings of mesenteric artery isolated from endothelial cell-specific CNP knockout mice. In addition. endothelin-1 gene expression was enhanced in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells from endothelial cell-specific CNP knockout mice. which also showed significantly higher plasma endothelin-1 concentrations and a greater reduction in blood pressure in response to an endothelin receptor antagonist than their control littermates. By contrast. vascular smooth muscle cell-specific GC-B knockout mice exhibited blood pressures similar to control mice. and acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation was preserved in their isolated mesenteric arteries. Nonetheless. CNP-induced acute vasorelaxation was nearly completely abolished in mesenteric arteries from vascular smooth muscle cell-specific GC-B knockout mice. These results demonstrate that endothelium-derived CNP contributes to the chronic regulation of vascular tone and systemic blood pressure by maintaining endothelial function independently of vascular smooth muscle GC-B.

93,The social isolation rearing of young adult rats is a model of psychosocial stress and provides a nonpharmacological tool to study alterations reminiscent of symptoms seen in psychosis. We have previously demonstrated that social isolation in rats leads to increased oxidative stress and to cerebral NOX2 elevations. Here. we investigated early alterations in mRNA expression leading to increased NOX2 in the brain. Rats were exposed to a short period of social isolation (1 week) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for mRNA expression of genes involved in blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation and integrity (ORLs. Vof 21 and Vof 16. Leng8. Vnr1. and Trank 1 genes) was performed. Real-time PCR experiments. immunohistochemistry. and Western blotting analysis showed an increased expression of these genes and related proteins in isolated rats with respect to control animals. The expression of specific markers of BBB integrity. such as matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). occludin 1. and plasmalemmal vesicle associated protein-1 (PV-1). was also significantly altered after 1 week of social isolation. BBB permeability. evaluated by quantification of Evans blue dye extravasation. as well as interstitial fluid. was significantly increased in rats isolated for 1 week with respect to controls. Isolation-induced BBB disruption was also accompanied by a significant increase of Interleukin 6 (IL-6) expression. Conversely. no differences in NOX2 levels were detected at this time point. Our study demonstrates that BBB disruption precedes NOX2 elevations in the brain. These results provide new insights in the interplay of mechanisms linking psychosocial stress to early oxidative stress in the brain. disruption of the BBB. and the development of mental disorders....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Schizophrenia
94,Since the lacZ alpha-based blue/white screening system was introduced to molecular biology. several different visual reporter systems were developed and used for various purposes in Escherichia coli. A common limit to the existent visual reporter systems is that an extracellular chromogenic substrate has to be added for the visible pigment production. In this study. we developed a new blue/white screening system based on a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase encoded by idgS from Streptomyces and a phosphopantetheinyl transferase encoded by sfp from Bacillus. When IdgS is activated from an apo-form to a holo-form via a posttranslational modification catalyzed by Sfp. it can synthesize a blue pigment indigoidine using L-glutamine. the amino acid abundant in cells. as a substrate. The new blue/white screening system contains a recipient E. coli strain with an optimized idgS gene cassette and a cloning vector harboring an sfp gene with an in-frame insertion of a multiple cloning site close to its N-terminal. We demonstrated that the IdgS/Sfp-based blue/white screening system is a powerful alternative to the lacZ alpha-based screening system. which does not require any external substrate addition....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Genetics
95,Bluetongue is a non-contagious. haemorrhagic. Culicoides-borne disease of ruminants. The causative agent. bluetongue virus (BTV). is a member of the Orbivirus genus of the Reoviridae family. So far. 26 BTV serotypes have been identified worldwide. The global distribution of bluetongue has been expanding. and rapid detection of BTV. preferably in the field. is critical for timely implementation of animal movement restrictions and vector control measures. To date. many laboratory-based. molecular assays for detection of BTV have been developed. These methods require the samples to be shipped to a central laboratory with sophisticated instruments and highly skilled technicians to perform the assays. conduct analyses and interpret the results. Here. we report the development and evaluation of a rapid. portable. user-friendly. pan-BTV reverse transcription-insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction (RT-iiPCR) assay that can potentially be used in low-resource field conditions. The total length of the assay was < 60 min. and at the end of the assay. the results were automatically displayed as `+' or '_' without the need for data interpretation. The RT-iiPCR assay detected 36 BTV isolates and two in vitro transcribed RNA samples representing all 26 BTV serotypes. The assay did not cross-react with other animal viruses tested. including two closely related orbiviruses. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was as low as nine copies of in vitro transcribed double-stranded BTV RNA. Analysis of BTVinfected whole blood samples showed that the BTV RT-iiPCR assay was as sensitive as real-time RT-PCR. The assay can potentially be used for rapid screening of animals for BTV in routine diagnostics and for monitoring bluetongue outbreaks both in ruminants and in Culicoides vectors in the field and in the laboratory....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Alzheimer's Disease
96,Small intestinal injury is seldom described in the context of child abuse. Signs and symptoms are subtle. often leading to delays in diagnosis. We describe a 3-year-old boy initially admitted with severe blunt abdominal trauma from physical child abuse. He was successfully managed nonoperatively. The child was then hospitalized several times for nonspecific abdominal symptoms until diagnostic laparoscopy discovered a jejunal stricture with a proximal jejuno-jejunal fistula. Symptoms fully resolved after resection. Delayed presentation of small intestinal injury should remain on the differential diagnosis in the evaluation of persistent abdominal symptoms in a child with a prior history of physical abuse. even if imaging studies do not reveal specific abnormalities....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health
97,Background. Blunted facial affect is a common negative symptom of schizophrenia. Additionally. assessing the trustworthiness of faces is a social cognitive ability that is impaired in schizophrenia. Currently available pharmacological agents are ineffective at improving either of these symptoms. despite their clinical significance. The hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin has multiple prosocial effects when administered intranasally to healthy individuals and shows promise in decreasing negative symptoms and enhancing social cognition in schizophrenia. Although two small studies have investigated oxytocin's effects on ratings of facial trustworthiness in schizophrenia. its effects on facial expressivity have not been investigated in any population. Method. We investigated the effects of oxytocin on facial emotional expressivity while participants performed a facial trustworthiness rating task in 33 individuals with schizophrenia and 35 age-matched healthy controls using a double-blind. placebo-controlled. cross-over design. Participants rated the trustworthiness of presented faces interspersed with emotionally evocative photographs while being video-recorded. Participants' facial expressivity in these videos was quantified by blind raters using a well-validated manualized approach (i.e. the Facial Expression Coding System; FACES). Results. While oxytocin administration did not affect ratings of facial trustworthiness. it significantly increased facial expressivity in individuals with schizophrenia (Z=-2.33. p=0.02) and at trend level in healthy controls (Z=-1.87. p=0.06). Conclusions. These results demonstrate that oxytocin administration can increase facial expressivity in response to emotional stimuli and suggest that oxytocin may have the potential to serve as a treatment for blunted facial affect in schizophrenia....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Schizophrenia
98,We previously reported that higher education protects against executive dysfunction related to higher body mass index (BMI) in younger. but not older. adults. We now extend the previous analyses to verbal and nonverbal memory. Fifty-nine healthy. dementia-free community-dwelling adults ranging in age from 18 to 81years completed the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-R) and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised (BVMT-R). Self-reported years of education served as a proxy for cognitive reserve. We found that more highly educated individuals maintained their BVMT-R immediate recall performance across the range of BMI. but in less educated individuals. higher BMI was associated with worse performance. Our findings suggest that education may play a protective role against BMI-related nonverbal learning deficits. similar to previous reports for verbal memory and executive functioning. Results highlight the importance of considering educational background when determining the risk for BMI-related cognitive impairment in clinical settings....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Dementia
99,NS3 protease plays a vital role in the replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). BMS-605339 is a novel linear tetra-peptide alpha-ketoamide inhibitor of NS3 protease and shows specificity for HCV NS3 protease genotype 1a and genotype 1b. Mutation at the key site 168 of the HCV NS3 protease can induce resistance to BMS-605339. which greatly affects the antiviral therapy efficacy to hepatitis C. In the present study. we employed molecular dynamics simulations. free energy calculations. and free energy decomposition to explore the drug resistance mechanism of BMS-605339 due to the three representative mutations D168C/Y/V. The free energy decomposition analysis indicates that the decrease in the binding affinity is mainly attributed to the decrease in both van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. After detailed analysis of our calculated results. we observed that the break of the salt bridge between residues 155 and 168 caused by the mutations D168C/Y/V is the original reason for the decrease in the binding ability between BMS-605339 and the mutant NS3 proteases. The obtained results will reveal the drug resistance mechanism between BMS-605339 and the mutant NS3 proteases. and provide valuable clue for designing novel and more potent drugs to HCV NS3 protease.

0,The Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)-containing zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) comprise the largest family of zinc finger transcription factors that function as transcriptional repressors. In the study of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-RET signaling. we have identified bone marrow zinc finger 3 (BMZF3). encoding a KRAB-ZFP. as a GDNF-inducible gene by differential display analysis. The expression of BMZF3 transcripts in the human neuroblastoma cell line TGW increased I h after GDNF stimulation. as determined by Northern blotting and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The BMZF3 possesses transcriptional repressor activity in the KRAB domain. BMZF3 interacts with a co-repressor protein. KRAB-associated protein I (KAP-1). through the KRAB domain and siRNA-mediated knockdown of KAP-1 abolished the transcriptional repressor activity of BMZF3. indicating that KAP-1 is necessary for BMZF3 function. Furthermore. siRNA-mediated silencing of BMZF3 inhibited cell proliferation. These findings suggest that BMZF3 is a transcriptional repressor induced by GDNF that plays a role in cell proliferation.

1,We present a generalization of the Bode integral formula for discrete-time linear periodic systems. It is shown that similar to the classical Bode integral formula. the sensitivity integral for a discrete-time linear periodic system depends only on the open-loop dynamics of the system; in particular. on the open-loop characteristic multipliers outside the unit circle in the complex plane. The integral is derived by using an asymptotic eigenvalue distribution theorem for block Toeplitz matrices. which does not require the open loop system to be stable or the disturbance to be Gaussian. The result is demonstrated through application to a class of multi-rate sampled data systems with commensurate rates....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,State space representation
2,Bodily knowledge has attracted significant attention within the humanities and other related fields over the last two decades. Although theoretical discussion on bodily knowledge in the context of physical education has been active over the past 10 years. these discussions lack clear conceptual analyses of bodily knowledge. Using a phenomenological approach. the purpose of this paper is to clarify the notion of bodily knowledge. furthering epistemological discussions of the topic within reflective. embodied practices. Instead of seeing bodily knowledge inherently connected to the acquisition of motor skills or improving physical fitness. we will discuss physical training as a reflective. embodied process that can turn sensuous information about the moving body into knowledge. Using outdoor running as an example. we describe the process of forming bodily knowledge. which includes: (1) the exploring and identifying of movement qualities. (2) developing capabilities of registering changes in the body and (3) directing and modifying one's own training processes based on bodily findings. Contextualizing this epistemological discussion with adults' recreational physical activity. this paper argues that bodily knowledge can cultivate individuals to trust their own body awareness and embodied responses to take more responsibility for their own physical exercise. When biomedical knowledge of the body in sport sciences tends to shrink the body to physiological attributes. such as muscle mass and fat percentage. our analysis stresses the agency of the lived body as a source of knowledge in physical activity....,Psychology,Psychology,Attention,Social cognition
3,The prevalence of weight problems is increasing worldwide. There is growing evidence that high body mass index (BMI) is associated with frontal lobe dysfunction and cognitive deficits concerning mental flexibility and inhibitory control efficiency. The present study aims at replicating and extending these observations. We compared cognitive control performance of normal weight (BMI= 25) university students on a task tapping either inhibitory control (Experiment 1) or interference control (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 replicated previous findings that found less efficient inhibitory control in overweight individuals. Experiment 2 complemented these findings by showing that cognitive control impairments associated with high BMI also extend to the ability to resolve stimulus-induced response conflict and to engage in conflict-driven control adaptation. The present results are consistent with and extend previous literature showing that high BMI in young. otherwise healthy individuals is associated with less efficient cognitive control functioning.

4,This study investigated the association between child maltreatment and body mass index (BMI) using data from four waves (wave 2 in 2011 through 5 in 2014) of the Korean Children & Youth PanelSurvey collected by the South Korean National Youth Policy Institute. We employed a latent growth curve modeling approach to estimate an unobserved latent trajectory and to test the longitudinal effects of child abuse and neglect on BMI. Our results indicate that child abuse is significantly associated with BMI and children who report higher levels of abuse tend to have higher rates of increase in their BMI. This study addresses a gap in the literature by demonstrating that a parent's maltreatment of their child has a long-term effect on the rate of change in their BMI over time....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health
5,The aim of this study was to explore the significant predictors associated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) outcome for patients with major depressive disorder. Major depressive disorder inpatients (N=130) requiring ECT were recruited from a major psychiatric center in South Taiwan. ECT was generally performed for a maximum of 12 sessions. Symptom severity was assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) before ECT. after every three ECT sessions. and after the last ECT. The generalized estimating equations method was used to analyze the influence of potential variables over time on the HAMD-17 and CGI-S. respectively. Fourteen patients not completing the first three sessions of ECT were excluded. The remaining 116 patients were included in the analysis. Patients with treatment-resistant depression. longer duration of the current depressive episode. and higher levels of pain were more likely to have less symptom reduction after acute treatment with ECT. irrespective of how the depressive symptoms were rated using HAMD-17 or CGI-S. To improve efficacy. earlier application of ECT and pain control should be considered during an acute course of ECT. Other clinical predictors related to ECT outcome require further investigation in future studies....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Depression
6,The majority of human neuroscience research has focussed on understanding functional organisation within segregated patches of cortex. The ventral visual stream has been associated with the detection of physical features such as faces and body parts. whereas the theory-of-mind network has been associated with making inferences about mental states and underlying character. such as whether someone is friendly. selfish. or generous. To date. however. it is largely unknown how such distinct processing components integrate neural signals. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and connectivity analyses. we investigated the contribution of functional integration to social perception. During scanning. participants observed bodies that had previously been associated with trait-based or neutral information. Additionally. we independently localised the body perception and theory-of-mind networks. We demonstrate that when observing someone who cues the recall of stored social knowledge compared to non-social knowledge. a node in the ventral visual stream (extrastriate body area) shows greater coupling with part of the theory-of-mind network (temporal pole). These results show that functional connections provide an interface between perceptual and inferential processing components. thus providing neurobiological evidence that supports the view that understanding the visual environment involves interplay between conceptual knowledge and perceptual processing....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
7,For young birds in a nest. body size may have implications for other aspects of development such as telomere length and immune function. However. it is possible to predict associations in either direction. On the one hand. there may be trade-offs between growth and telomere maintenance. and growth and investment in immune function. suggesting there will be negative correlations. On the other hand. relatively larger individuals might be advantaged in competition with their nest-mates. allowing them to garner more resources overall. leading to positive correlations. We studied development over the nestling period in 34 nests of wild European starlings. Sturnus vulgaris. Intrabrood competition is typically more intense in larger broods. Hence. we predicted that body size should become an increasingly positive predictor of telomere length and immune functioning as brood size increases. In partial support of our prediction. there were significant interactions between brood size and body size in predicting both erythrocyte telomere length change and plasma levels of the cytokine interleukin-6. The associations between body size and these outcomes went from negative in the smallest broods to positive in the largest. A further immune marker. high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. showed no systematic patterning with body size or brood size. Our results confirm that the size to which a nestling grows is important for telomere dynamics and the development of the immune system. but the phenotypic associations are moderated by the competitive context....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Children's Health
8,Background: Small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes. Previously. only microRNAs (miRNAs) and piRNAs have been identified in the silkworm. Bombyx mori. Furthermore. only ncRNAs (50-500nt) of intermediate size have been systematically identified in the silkworm. Results: Here. we performed a systematic identification and analysis of small RNAs (18-50nt) associated with the Bombyx mori argonaute2 (BmAgo2) protein. Using RIP-seq. we identified various types of small ncRNAs associated with BmAGO2. These ncRNAs showed a multimodal length distribution. with three peaks at similar to 20nt. similar to 27nt and similar to 33nt. which included tRNA-. transposable element (TE)-. rRNA-. snoRNA-and snRNA-derived small RNAs as well as miRNAs and piRNAs. The tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) were found at an extremely high abundance and accounted for 69.90% of the BmAgo2-associated small RNAs. Northern blotting confirmed that many tRFs were expressed or up-regulated only in the BmNPV-infected cells. implying that the tRFs play a prominent role by binding to BmAgo2 during BmNPV infection. Additional evidence suggested that there are potential cleavage sites on the D. anti-codon and T psi C loops of the tRNAs. TE-derived small RNAs and piRNAs also accounted for a significant proportion of the BmAgo2-associated small RNAs. suggesting that BmAgo2 could be involved in the maintenance of genome stability by suppressing the activities of transposons guided by these small RNAs. Finally. Northern blotting was also used to confirm the Bombyx 5.8 s rRNA-derived small RNAs. demonstrating that various novel small RNAs exist in the silkworm. Conclusions: Using an RIP-seq method in combination with Northern blotting. we identified various types of small RNAs associated with the BmAgo2 protein. including tRNA-. TE-. rRNA-. snoRNA-and snRNA-derived small RNAs as well as miRNAs and piRNAs. Our findings provide new clues for future functional studies of the role of small RNAs in insect development and evolution....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,DNA/RNA sequencing
9,The larval pigment pattern in the silkworm. Bombyx mori. is formed by melanin. ommochromes and pteridines. During development all these pigments are synthesized autonomously. and possibly also with mutual interaction between them. to yield unique pigment patterns. In order to find the key trigger for such pigment pattern formation. developmental changes in pteridine biosynthesis were studied using the quail mutant (q/q). which has darker larval marks formed by melanin and an abundance of ommochromes in the integument. In the current study. emphasis has been placed on the analysis of GTP-cyclohydrolase I (GTP-CH I). which is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of pteridines. during the development of the silkworm. Results of Northern blotting showed that in the quail mutant strong signals of GTP-CH I mRNA appeared around each period of ecdysis. while no such signals appeared in the background strain (+q/q) used. Also. both GTP-CH I activities and pteridine content were higher in the quail mutant compared with the background strain. These results strongly suggest that pteridine biosynthesis is closely linked to the formation of melanin and ommochromes. It is also suggested here that in the silkworm a recessive gene (q) may be involved in the regulation of its pigment pattern formation....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
10,Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta are strongly associated with osteoblast differentiation. Mechanical stress including compressive force (CF) also involve in osteoblast differentiation via the alteration of the expression of bone-specific transcription factors. namely Runx2 and Osterix. However. the role of TGF-beta s in mediating the effects of CF on osteoblasts remains unclear. In the present study. we examined the effects of CF on the expression of TGF-beta 1. TGF-beta 2. TGF-beta type 1 and 2 receptor (T beta r1 and T beta r2). and Runx2 and Osterix in osteoblasts: We also investigated the effects of CF on the phosphorylation of Smad2. Smad3 and p38; which were located on the downstream of T beta rs. Effect of T beta r inhibitor (LY2109761) on expression of Runx2 and Osterix. and phosphorylation of Smad2. Smad3 and p38 were additionally examined Cultured MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells were subjected. or not. to continuous CF (1.0 g/ cm(2) or 2.0 g/cm(2)) for 1-9 h. TGF-beta 1. TGF-beta 2. T beta r1. T beta r2. Runx2 and Osterix expression were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Phosphorylation levels of Smad2. Smad3 and p38 were determined by Western blot analysis. The mRNA and protein expression of TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 were significantly increased by 1.0 g/cm(2). but not 2.0 g/cm(2). CF for 3-6 h. relative to control cells; T beta r1 and T beta r2 expression were unaffected by either CF condition. The 1.0 g/cm(2) CF also increased the phosphorylation of Smad2. Smad3 and p38 and the expression of Runx2 and Osterix. and these increases were attenuated by pretreatment with LY2109761. The present findings indicate that 1.0 g/cm(2) CF can induce bone-specific transcription factors via autocrine action of CF-induced TGF-beta signaling in osteoblasts....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Osteoporosis
11,Chimerism associated with placental sharing in marmosets has been traditionally analysed using conventional chromosome staining on metaphase spreads or polymerase chain reaction. However. the former technique requires the presence of proliferating cells. whereas the latter may be associated with possible blood cell contamination. Therefore. we aimed to develop a single-cell analysis technique for sexing marmoset cells. We applied fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) to cell nuclei using differentially labelled X and Y chromosome-specific probes. Herein we present the validation of this method in metaphase cells from a marmoset lymphoblastoid cell line. as well as application of the method for evaluation of cross-sex chimerism in interphase blood lymphocytes and haematopoietic bone marrow cells from marmosets of same- and mixed-sex litters. The results show conclusively that haematopoietic cells of bone marrow and leucocytes from blood are cross-sex chimeric when the litter is mixed sex. In addition. single samples of liver and spleen cell suspensions from one individual were tested. Cross-sex chimerism was observed in the spleen but not in liver cells. We conclude that FISH is the method of choice to identify cross-sex chimerism. especially when combined with morphological identification of nuclei of different cell types. which will allow a targeted tissue-specific analysis....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Alzheimer's Disease
12,Background Diamond-Blackfan anemia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome are inherited bone marrow failure syndromes linked to defects in ribosome synthesis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether yeast models for Diamond-Blackfan anemia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome differed in the mechanism by which ribosome synthesis was affected. Design and Methods Northern blotting. pulse-chase analysis. and polysome profiling were used to study ribosome synthesis in yeast models. Localization of 60S ribosomal subunits was assessed using RPL25eGFP. Results Relative to wild-type controls. each disease model showed defects in 60S subunit maturation. but with distinct underlying mechanisms. In the model of Diamond-Blackfan anemia. 60S subunit maturation was disrupted at a relatively early stage with abortive complexes subject to rapid degradation. 5S ribosomal RNA. unlike other large subunit ribosomal RNA in this model. accumulated as an extra-ribosomal species. In contrast. subunit maturation in the Shwachman-Diamond syndrome model was affected at a later step. giving rise to relatively stable pre-60S particles with associated 5S ribosomal RNA retained in the nucleus. Conclusions These differences between the yeast Diamond-Blackfan anemia and Shwactiman-Diamond syndrome models have implications for signaling mechanisms linking abortive ribosome. assembly to cell fate decisions and may contribute to the divergent clinical presentations of Diamond-Blackfan anemia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Myelofibrosis
13,Background: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells with a high constitutive level of autophagy and low expression of CD99. Under certain conditions. MSCs may develop tumorigenic properties. However. these transformation-induced conditions are largely unknown. Recently. we have identified an association between Hsp70. a main participant in cellular stress response and tumorigenesis. and CD99. Preliminary observations had revealed upregulation of both proteins in stressed long-term cultured MSCs. And so we hypothesized that CD99 is implicated in stress-induced mechanisms of cellular transformation in MSCs. Hence. we investigated the effects of prolonged stress on MSCs and the role of CD99 and autophagy in their survival. Methods: Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) overexpressing immortalized MSCs and primary bone marrow stromal cells were used to investigate the influence of long-term serum deprivation and hypoxia on growth and differentiation of MSCs. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated using flow cytometry. differentiation capabilities of MSCs were assessed by immunohistochemical staining followed by microscopic examination. CD99. Hsp70 expression were analyzed using flow cytometry. western blotting. and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Autophagy was explored with specific inhibitors using cell morphology examination and western blotting. Results: Chronic stress factors are able to change the morphology of MSCs and to inhibit spontaneous differentiation into adipocyte lineage. Furthermore. CD99 elevation and downregulation of p53 and p21 accompanied defective autophagy. which is usually associated with tumor formation. We found that inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine promoted cell detachment and modulated CD99 expression level whereas incorporation of CD99 recombinant protein into the cells suppressed autophagy. Conclusions: Obtained results provide a model for chronic stress-induced transformation of MSCs via CD99 and may therefore be highly relevant to mesenchymal tumorigenesis....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
14,Immunodeficient mice play a critical role in hematology research as in vivo models of hematopoiesis and immunology. Multiple strains have been developed. but hematopoietic stem cell engraftment and immune reconstitution have not been methodically compared among them. Four mouse strains were transplanted with human fetal bone marrow or adult peripheral blood CD34(+) cells: NSG. NSG-3GS. hSCF-Tg-NSG. and hSIRP alpha-DKO. Hematopoietic engraftment in the bone marrow. blood. spleen. and liver was evaluated by flow cytometry 12 weeks after transplant. The highest levels of human engraftment were observed in the liver. spleen. and bone marrow. whereas peripheral blood cell chimerism was notably less. The highest levels of tissue engraftment were in hSCF-Tg-NSG mice. but NSG mice exhibited the highest blood leukocyte engraftment. hSCF-Tg-NSG mice also exhibited the highest levels of CD133(+)CD34(++) stem cells. hSIRPa-DKO engrafted poorly and exhibited poor breeding. Myelopoiesis was greatest in NSG-3GS mice. followed by hSCF-Tg-NSG and NSG mice. whereas B cell engraftment exhibited the opposite pattern. Engraftment of CD3(+) T cells. CD3(+)CD161(+)T cells. and CD3(-)CD56(+) NK cells was greatest in NSG-3GS mice. Mast cell engraftment was highest in hSCF-Tg-NSG mice. but was also elevated in spleen and livers of NSG-3GS mice. Basophils were most abundant in NSG-3GS mice. Overall. hSCF-Tg-NSG mice are the best recipient mice for studies requiring high levels of human hematopoiesis. stem cell engraftment. and an intermediate level of myelopoiesis. whereas NSG and NSG-3GS mice offer select advantages in the engraftment of certain blood cell lineages....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Lymphoma
15,Aim: To test the hypothesis that genistein stimulates the osteoblastic differentiation through the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-core-binding factor 1 (Cbfa1) pathway. Methods: The activation of p38 MAPK was detected by Western blotting. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium deposition were assessed for osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) cultures. The expression of Cbfa1 was analyzed at both the mRNA and protein levels. The activity of Cbfa1 was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Bone sialoprotein (BSP). ALP. osteocalcin (OC). and osteopontin (OPN) gene transcription were also evaluated by either RT-PCR or Northern blotting. Results: Genistein (0.01-1 mu mol/L) dose dependently led to the rapid and sustained activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in mouse BMSC cultures. Treatment with genistein (1 mu mol/L) resulted in increased ALP activity and calcium deposition of BMSC cultures as a function of time. Genistein also enhanced Cbfa1 DNA binding activity and promoted the expressions of Cbfa1 itself as well as several Cbfa1-regulated genes. including ALP. BSP. OC. and OPN. Concurrent treatment with p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) diminished the genistein-induced osteoblastic maturation and p38 MAPK-Cbfa1 activation in mouse BMSC cultures. Conclusion: These results indicated that genistein could stimulate the osteoblastic differentiation of BMSC cultures through the p38 MAPK-Cbfa1 pathway....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Enzymology
16,Background: Novel therapies for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are needed. particularly for cancers not driven by androgen receptor (AR) activation. Objectives: To identify molecular subgroups of PC bone metastases of relevance for therapy. Design. setting. and participants: Fresh-frozen bone metastasis samples from men with CRPC (n = 40). treatment-nai " ve PC (n = 8). or other malignancies (n = 12) were characterized using whole-genome expression profiling. multivariate principal component analysis (PCA). and functional enrichment analysis. Expression profiles were verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in an extended set of bone metastases (n = 77) and compared to levels in malignant and adjacent benign prostate tissue from patients with localized disease (n = 12). Selected proteins were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. A cohort of PC patients (n = 284) diagnosed at transurethral resection with long follow-up was used for prognostic evaluation. Results and limitations: The majority of CRPC bone metastases (80%) was defined as AR driven based on PCA analysis and high expression of the AR. AR co-regulators (FOXA1. HOXB13). and AR-regulated genes (KLK2. KLK3. NKX3.1. STEAP2. TMPRSS2); 20% were non-AR-driven. Functional enrichment analysis indicated high metabolic activity and low immune responses in AR-driven metastases. Accordingly. infiltration of CD3+ and CD68+ cells was lower in AR-driven than in non-AR-driven metastases. and tumor cell HLA class I ABC immunoreactivity was inversely correlated with nuclear AR immunoreactivity. RT-PCR analysis showed low MHC class I expression (HLA-A. TAP1. and PSMB9 mRNA) in PC bone metastases compared to benign and malignant prostate tissue and bone metastases of other origins. In primary PC. low HLA class I ABC immunoreactivity was associated with high Gleason score. bone metastasis. and short cancer-specific survival. Limitations include the limited number of patients studied and the single metastasis sample studied per patient. Conclusions: Most CRPC bone metastases show high AR and metabolic activities and low immune responses. A subgroup instead shows low AR and metabolic activities. but high immune responses. Targeted therapy for these groups should be explored. Patient summary: We studied heterogeneities at a molecular level in bone metastasis samples obtained from men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. We found differences of possible importance for therapy selection in individual patients. (C) 2016 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.

17,Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) participates significantly in vascular development and pathophysiological processes. Angiotensin II (AngII) has been demonstrated to be critical in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. However. the effects of AngII on BMP-2 expression and of probucol on the AngII-induced BMP-2 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are unknown. The aim of our study was to investigate these effects. HUVECs were cultured and stimulated with various agents. The total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and BMP-2 were measured by standard methods. Northern blotting was used to detect the expression of BMP-2 mRNA. The activation of NF-kappa B in the HUVECs was also determined. The AngII treatment significantly increased BMP-2 expression levels and activated NF-kappa B. These effects were suppressed by treatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) or probucol. Furthermore. the increased levels of MDA in the conditioned medium and the decrease in the total SOD activity caused by the AngII treatment were reversed by treatment with probucol or PDTC. Probucol downregulated the AngII-nduced BMP-2 expression. These effects of probucol may be mediated by the inhibition of NF-kappa B activation....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Heart Disease
18,Alveolar bone resorption caused by trauma or periodontal diseases has represented a challenge for both dental clinicians and researchers. In this study. we evaluate the osteogenic potential of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) through a direct transdifferentiation from HGFs to functional osteoblasts via epigenetic modification and osteogenic signaling with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) in vitro and in vivo. HGF treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) induced demethylation in the hypermethylated CpG islands of the osteogenic lineage marker genes RUNX2 and ALP. and subsequent BMP2 treatment successfully drove the fibroblasts to the osteoblasts' lineage. Cell morphological changes viewed under microscopy and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alizarin red S (ARS) staining confirmed the osteoblastic change mediated by epigenetic modification as did real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). methylation-specific PCR (MSP). and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. which demonstrated the altered methylation patterns in the RUNX2 and ALP promoter regions and their effect on gene expression. Furthermore. micro-computed tomography (CT) analysis of in vivo mouse cell transplantation experiments showed high-density signal in the epigenetically modified HGF group; in addition. a significant amount of bone formation was observed in the transplanted material using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as well. Collectively. our results indicate that epigenetic modification permits the direct programming of HGFs into functional osteoblasts. suggesting that this approach might open a novel therapeutic avenue in alveolar bone regeneration....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Osteoporosis
19,Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of lymphatic tissue to heterotopic ossification (HO). Background: HO is the pathologic development of ectopic bone within soft tissues often following severe trauma. Characterization of the tissue niche supporting HO is critical to identifying therapies directed against this condition. Lymphangiogenesis is upregulated during incidents of trauma. thereby coincident with the niche supportive of HO. We hypothesized that lymphatic tissues play a critical role in HO formation. Methods: Mice underwent hindlimb Achilles' tendon transection and dorsal burn injury (burn/tenotomy) to induce HO. The popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes were excised ipsilateral to the tenotomy site. Flow cytometry and immunostaining were used to quantify and localize lymphoendothelium. MicroCT was used to quantify HO. Results: Enrichment of mature lymphatic tissues was noted 2 weeks after injury at the tendon transection sites when compared with the contralateral. intact tendon based on LYVE1+ tubules (10.9% vs 0.8%. P < 0.05). Excision of the inguinal and popliteal nodes with draining popliteal lymphatic vessel significantly decreased the presence of mature lymphoendothelium 2 weeks after injury (10.9% vs 3.3%. P < 0.05). Bone-cartilage-stromal progenitor cells (CD105+/AlphaV+/Tie2-/CD45-/CD90-/BP1-) were also significantly decreased after lymph node excision (10.2% vs 0.5%. P < 0.05). A significant decrease was noted in the volume of de novo HOpresent within the soft tissues (0.12 mm(3) vs 0.02 mm(3)). Conclusion: These findings suggest that lymphatic vessels are intimately linked with the de novo formation bone within soft tissues following trauma. and their presence may facilitate bone formation....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Osteoarthritis
20,Growth recovery lines. also known as growth arrest lines. are transverse radiodense metaphyseal bands that develop due to a temporary arrest of endochondral ossification caused by local or systemic insults. To determine if growth recovery lines are more common in infants at high risk versus low risk for abuse. Reports of American College of Radiology compliant skeletal surveys (1999-2013) were reviewed with clinical records. Infants at low risk for abuse had a skull fracture without significant intracranial injury. history of a fall and clinical determination of low risk (child protection team/social work assessment). Infants at high risk had significant intracranial injury. retinal hemorrhages. other skeletal injuries and clinical determination of high risk. There were 52 low-risk infants (mean: 4.7 months. range: 0.4-12 months) and 21 high-risk infants (mean: 4.2 months. range: 0.8-9.1 months). Two blinded radiologists independently evaluated the skeletal survey radiographs of the knees/lower legs for the presence of at least one growth recovery line. When growth recovery lines are scored as probably present or definitely present. their prevalence in the low-risk group was 38% (standard deviation [SD] = 8%; reader 1 = 17/52. reader 2 = 23/52) vs. 71% (SD = 7%; reader 1 = 16/21. reader 2 = 14/21) in the high-risk group (P < 0.001; odds ratio 4.0. 95% CI: 1.7-9.5). Growth recovery lines are encountered at a significantly higher rate in infants at high risk vs. low risk for abuse. This suggests that abused infants are prone to a temporary disturbance in endochondral ossification as a result of episodic physiological stresses....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health
21,Determining individual health status is of great importance for a better understanding of life history trade-offs between growth. reproduction. and maintenance. However. existing immunological methods are invasive and therefore not suitable for investigating health status in wild populations. Thus. there is an urgent need for non-invasive methods to assess the immune status of animals. Neopterin is involved in the cell-mediated pathway of the immune response (Th1-type). secreted during the activation of monocytes and macrophages. We investigated if urinary neopterin could serve as a biomarker of health status in bonobos and chimpanzees. First. we performed a chemical validation of a commercial neopterin enzyme immune assay (EIA) for bonobo and chimpanzee urine. We then examined if urinary neopterin levels in bonobos increase during the acute period of respiratory infections. We found that neopterin levels can be reliably measured in urine of the two species with a commercial EIA. Stability experiments revealed considerable changes in urinary neopterin levels in relation to multiple freezethaw cycles and extended exposure to room temperature. Exposure to sunlight led to a degradation of urinary neopterin. whereas sample storage up to two years did not affect urinary neopterin levels. There was no detectable diurnal variation in neopterin levels. and levels remained very stable across several days in healthy individuals. While urinary neopterin levels were independent of sex. nonadult individuals had higher urinary neopterin levels than adults. Most importantly. there was a significant increase in urinary neopterin levels during a period of respiratory infection. Our results demonstrate that regular urine sample collection would allow for the monitoring of individual health status and disease progression with minimal disturbance of the subjects. In combination with behavioral. life history. and endocrinological parameters. the method can be used to investigate questions related to immunocompetence handicaps or life history trade-offs....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Kidney Health
22,Conventionally. a high accuracy operational amplifier (OPA)-based current sensor is used for sensing current message under a full load range. which increases the cost characteristic. Instead of a high accuracy OPA-based current sensor. this paper describes using a switching inductor quasi-V-2 hysteretic control boost dc-dc regulator with a proposed current-sensing technique named emulated-ramp feedback (ERF). which can improve transfer efficiency under a full load range. Two control systems are presented in this paper. The first system. a hysteretic voltage control switching boost converter with ERF. achieves the hysteretic voltage control in a boost regulator and lowers the cost characteristic without using compensator. The second system. a quasi-V-2 hysteretic voltage control switching boost converter with ERF. demonstrates the compatibility of ERF technique in rippled-based control boost converters. The regulator was implemented with TSMC 0.25-mu m HV CMOS process. Experimental results show the second system can work under the specification of 5-12V with a 0 to 300-mA load range. Additionally. this system attained a recovery time is 27/95 mu s for step-up/step-down in a 100 to 300-mA continuous conduction mode load current. and a peak efficiency of 92.1% with a chip area of only 1.014mm(2).

23,Monte Carlo (MC) techniques are widely applied to check a design on its robustness and for estimating the production yield of integrated circuits. Using standard random MC and the sample yield for estimation. a very large number of samples is required for accurate verification. especially if a high yield is desired. This can make MC extremely time consuming. but if the data follows a normal Gaussian distribution a much faster yield prediction is possible by using the well-known C-PK method. We extended this specification-distance-based scheme for the far more difficult general non-normal case by three different means. ending up in a new generalized process capability index named C-GPK. First. we apply parametric modeling only to the specification-sided distribution part. This way any difficulties in distribution parts that actually have little yield impact do not degrade the model fit anymore. Second. to improve the parametric model we introduce a new tail parameter t. Third. to allow modeling of difficult asymmetrical. multimodal or flat distributions we also introduce a new reference location parameter instead of using the mean. An advantage of improving MC this way is that-in opposite to many other MC enhancements (like importance sampling)-the performance of the C-GPK is not negatively impacted by design complexity. We described the formulation of the C-GPK and derived confidence intervals using an advanced bootstrap scheme. We verified the performance against the sample yield and C-PK for a representative set of distributions. including real production data and MC data from the design of a CMOS operational amplifier and other circuits....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
24,ObjectivesBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by emotional instability. interpersonal dysfunction. and other features that typically develop before a background of insecure attachment and traumatic experiences. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has proven highly effective in reducing self-harm and improving emotion regulation. whereby problems concerning social cognition. which are also characteristic of BPD. may need additional approaches such as mentalization-based treatment (MBT). MethodsHere. we examined. in a pilot study. the effectiveness of MBT given adjunct to DBT. compared to DBT alone. in an inpatient sample with BPD. whereby mentalization was measured using a novel cartoon-based task. ResultsBoth treatments were highly effective in reducing symptom severity. The combination of DBT and MBT was superior in reducing fearful attachment and in improving affective mentalizing. ConclusionsMentalization-based treatment in combination with DBT may improve certain aspects of social cognitive skills and attachment security. as compared to DBT alone. although the exact mechanisms that led to these changes need to be studied further. Practitioner points Clinical implications Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) can usefully be combined with mentalization-based treatment (MBT). The combination of DBT and MBT reduces self-harm more than DBT alone. DBT plus MBT may lead to a reduction in fearful attachment and improvement of affective mentalizing. Short-term combinations of evidence-based borderline treatments may enrich psychiatric inpatient care. Therefore. such approaches deserve further research. Limitations The treatment condition was therapeutically more intense than the control condition. The study lacked a follow-up assessment. The impact of comorbid conditions on treatment response was not taken into account. Adherence to the manualized approach was not measured....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Borderline personality disorder
25,Borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been shown to be a valid and reliable diagnosis in adolescents and associated with a decrease in both general and social functioning. With evidence linking BPD in adolescents to poor prognosis. it is important to develop a better understanding of factors and mechanisms contributing to the development of BPD. This could potentially enhance our knowledge and facilitate the design of novel treatment programs and interventions for this group. In this paper. we outline a theoretical model of BPD in adolescents linking the original mentalization-based theory of BPD. with recent extensions of the theory that focuses on hypermentalizing and epistemic trust. We then provide clinical case vignettes to illustrate this extended theoretical model of BPD. Furthermore. we suggest a treatment approach to BPD in adolescents that focuses on the reduction of hypermentalizing and epistemic mistrust. We conclude with an integration of theory and practice in the final section of the paper and make recommendations for future work in this area....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Borderline personality disorder
26,Impairments in interpersonal relationships are a core feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Social cognition dysfunction. like false recognition of others' emotions and intentions. may lead to emotional disturbances. self-injury. and impulsive aggression behaviors in patients with BPD. This study explored the extent to which social cognition. including emotional recognition and theory of mind (ToM). can predict the ability of social awareness in patients with BPD. Emotion recognition tasks (matching emotional facial expressions to prosody). verbal and nonverbal theory of mind tasks. and the awareness of social inference test were assessed. Results of a stepwise multiple regression showed that the quality of the early parent-child relationship. anger prosody recognition. and ToM were significantly related to the ability to be aware of social interactions in the patients with BPD....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
27,Canine respiratory diseases are commonly seen in dogs along with co -infections with multiple respiratory pathogens. including viruses and bacteria. Virus infections in even vaccinated dogs were also reported. The clinical signs caused by different respiratory etiological agents are similar. which makes differential diagnosis imperative. An oligonucleotide microarray system was developed in this study. The wild type and vaccine strains of canine distemper virus (CDV). influenza virus. canine herpesvirus (CHV). Bordetella bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma cynos were detected and differentiated simultaneously on a microarray chip. The detection limit is 10. 10. 100. 50 and 50 copy numbers for CDV. influenza virus. CHV. B. bronchiseptica and M. cynos. respectively. The clinical test results of nasal swab samples showed that the microarray had remarkably better efficacy than the multiplex PCR-agarose gel method. The positive detection rate of microarray and agarose gel was 59.0% (n=33) and 41.1% (n =23) among the 56 samples. respectively. CDV vaccine strain and pathogen co -infections were further demonstrated by the microarray but not by the multiplex PCR-agarose gel. The oligonucleotide microarray provides a highly efficient diagnosis alternative that could be applied to clinical usage. greatly assisting in disease therapy and control. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

28,Obesity is a major global public health concern. Immune responses implicated in obesity also control certain infections. We investigated the effects of high-fat diet-induced obesity (DIO) on infection with the Lyme disease bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi in mice. DIO was associated with systemic suppression of neutrophil- and macrophage-based innate immune responses. These included bacterial uptake and cytokine production. and systemic. progressive impairment of bacterial clearance. and increased carditis severity. B.burgdorferi-infected mice fed normal diet also gained weight at the same rate as uninfected mice fed high-fat diet. toll-like receptor 4 deficiency rescued bacterial clearance defects. which greater in female than male mice. and killing of an unrelated bacterium (Escherichia coli) by bone marrow-derived macrophages from obese. B.burgdorferi-infected mice was also affected. Importantly. innate immune suppression increased with infection duration and depended on cooperative and synergistic interactions between DIO and B.burgdorferi infection. Thus. obesity and B.burgdorferi infection cooperatively and progressively suppressed innate immunity in mice....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Rheumatoid Arthritis
29,Tick-borne borreliae include Lyme disease and relapsing fever agents. and they are transmitted primarily by ixodid (hard) and argasid (soft) tick vectors. respectively. Tick-host interactions during feeding are complex. with host immune responses influenced by biological differences in tick feeding and individual differences within and between host species. One of the first encounters for spirochetes entering vertebrate host skin is with local antigen-presenting cells. regardless of whether the tick-associated Borrelia sp. is pathogenic. In this study. we performed a basic comparison of cytokine responses in THP-1-derived macrophages after exposure to selected borreliae. including a nonpathogen. By using THP-1 cells. differentiated to macrophages. we eliminated variations in host response and reduced the system to an in vitro model to evaluate the extent to which the Borrelia spp. influence cytokine production. Differentiated THP-1 cells were exposed to four Borrelia spp.. Borrelia hermsii (DAH). Borrelia burgdorferi (B31). B. burgdorferi (NC-2). or Borrelia lonestari (LS-1). or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (activated) or media (no treatment) controls. Intracellular and secreted interferon (IFN)-gamma. interleukin (IL)-1 beta. IL-6. and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were measured using flow cytometric and Luminex-based assays. respectively. at 6. 24. and 48 h postexposure time points. Using a general linear model ANOVA for each cytokine. treatment (all Borrelia spp. and LPS compared to no treatment) had a significant effect on secreted TNF-alpha only. Time point had a significant effect on intracellular IFN-gamma. TNF-alpha and IL-6. However. we did not see significant differences in selected cytokines among Borrelia spp. treatments. Thus. in this model. we were unable to distinguish pathogenic from nonpathogenic borreliae using the limited array of selected cytokines. While unique immune profiles may be detectable in an in vitro model and may reveal predictors for pathogenicity in borreliae of unknown pathogenicity. a larger panel of cytokines would be desirable to test....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Fungal Infection
30,The translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is an important component of the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway. the major regulator of cell growth in animals and fungi. Despite its relevance. knowledge on plant TCTP homologs is still limited. In the present study. the full-length BoTCTP cDNA was isolated from a cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) cDNA library. The BoTCTP cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 168 amino acids and shared the highly conserved GTPase binding surface in all of the species analyzed. Northern blotting analysis showed that BoTCTP was specifically expressed in the root and stem. Furthermore. the expression of BoTCTP could be obviously enhanced by stress stimuli. including high temperature and salt stresses. while no significant changes in the BoTCTP expression were observed under ABA stress. Functional analysis of BoTCTP was performed by the silencing of BoTCTP using RNA interference (RNAi) and the BoTCTP RNAi plants exhibited reduced vegetative growth rate and decreased tolerance of the cold. high temperature. and salt stresses. The reported results clearly suggest that the BoTCTP gene is involved in the regulation of both growth and stress response in cabbage....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Cell biology
31,Introduction: Botulinum toxin (BT) is used in many medical specialties to treat muscle hyperactivity. exocrine gland hyperactivity and pain disorders. BT drugs consist of botulinum neurotoxin (BNT). complexing proteins (CP) and excipients. Antibodies can be formed against BNT and CP. When they are formed against BNT (BTAB) they can block BT's therapeutic efficacy thus producing antibody induced therapy failure (ABTF).Areas covered: BT applied and BTAB are in a functional balance within the body. ABTF is rare. but influences the treatment algorithms of BT therapy considerably. ABTF risk factors include BT doses given. interinjection intervals. booster injections and immunological quality of the BT drug. Testing for BTAB and interpretation of ABTF is complicated. As management of ABTF is frustrating. prevention of ABTF is of major importance. Improved antigenicity of new BT drugs may improve treatment algorithms of BT therapy. substandard antigenicity may very likely be their end.Expert commentary: Concern about ABTF has influenced the treatment algorithms of BT therapy considerably. Better understanding of ABTF may improve them and. thus. the outcome of BT therapy. New BT drugs may have further improved antigenicity. especially when their CP are removed. They may. however. fail because of antigenicity problems....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Overactive Bladder
32,Conventional phase leading input current (PLIC) compensation techniques have focused on a continuous conduction mode (CCM) boost power factor corrector (PFC). In precedent studies. the causes of the PLIC have been investigated by analyzing the current control loop and the input impedance of a boost PFC. However. in a boundary conduction mode (BCM) boost PFC. the current flowing through the input filter capacitor becomes a main cause due to its large ripple current. Despite that. there has not been any effort to compensate the current in the input filter capacitor (IFC) in a BCM boost PFC. In this paper. a new digital control method is proposed to compensate PLIC in a BCM boost PFC. by minimizing the effect of the IFC. The proposed method uses only the derivative of the input voltage. without any additional component. Also. the proposed method improves the displacement factor. but does not affect the distortion factor. resulting in a high power quality in the entire input and output conditions. The derivation of the proposed method is presented based on time-domain analysis. and the effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally verified with a 60-Hz. 90-230 V-rms input and 395-V/0.5-A output prototype....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
33,This paper presents a novel predictive digital control method for boundary conduction mode PFC converters without the need for detecting the inductor current. In the proposed method. the inductor current is predicted by analytical equations instead of being detected by a sensing-resistor. The predicted zero-crossing point of the inductor current is determined by the values of the input voltage. output voltage and predicted inductor current. Importantly. the prediction of zero-crossing point is achieved in just a single switching cycle. Therefore. the errors in predictive calculation caused by parameter variations can be compensated. The prediction of the zero-crossing point with the proposed method has been shown to have good accuracy. The proposed method also shows high stability towards variations in both the inductance and output power. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed predictive digital control method for PFC converters....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
34,In boost converters and other indirect energy transfer topologies. transient-oriented controllers are designed to facilitate a dynamic response that may range from minimum time up to minimum output voltage deviation. Since analytical definitions for these control laws can become quite complex. a large-signal stability verification is not immediate. This paper explores the existence of stability of indirect energy transfer converters that are controlled by either boundary or hybrid controllers and introduces a new simplified procedure for examination of large-signal stability of a given converter and load type using a graphical-analytical approach. The stability analysis and examination method are demonstrated on a boost converter loaded by resistive load and constant current load. The stability conditions are verified using a 30 W 3.3-to-12 V boost converter prototype. controlled by a programmable-deviation controller and time-optimal controller. verifying their large-signal stability....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Control engineering
35,This article explores socially withdrawn young Finnish people on an Internet forum who identify with the Japanese hikikomori phenomenon. We aim to overcome the dualism between sociology and psychology found in earlier research by referring to Pierre Bourdieu. who provides insights into how individual choices are constructed in accordance with wider social settings. We focus on the individual level and everyday choices. but we suggest that psychological factors (anxiety. depression) can be seen as properties of social relations rather than as individual states of mind. as young adults have unequal access to valued resources. We scrutinise young people's specific reasoning related to the social and psychological factors and contingent life events that influence their choice to withdraw. An experience of inadequacy. a feeling of failure and a lack of self-efficacy are common experiences in the data. This indicates that young adults who identify with the hikikomori phenomenon find external society demanding and consider themselves lacking resources such as education. social networks or the personality type that they see as valued in society and as essential to survival'. They also feel that they cannot control their life events. which may mean that they receive little help in their everyday lives....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Depression
36,We have previously shown that there is high Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange (NCX) activity in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. In this study. by monitoring the [Ca(2+)](i) change in single cells and in a population of chromaffin cells. when the reverse mode of exchanger activity has been initiated. we have shown that the NCX activity is enhanced by K(+). The K(+)-enhanced activity accounted for a significant proportion of the Na(+)-dependent Ca(2+) uptake activity in the chromaffin cells. The results support the hypothesis that both NCX and Na(+)/Ca(2+)-K(+) exchanger (NCKX) are co-present in chromaffin cells. The expression of NCKX in chromaffin cells was further confirmed using PCR and northern blotting. In addition to the plasma membrane. the exchanger activity. measured by Na(+)-dependent (45)Ca(2+) uptake. was also present in membrane isolated from the chromaffin granules enriched fraction and the mitochondria enriched fraction. The results support that both NCX and NCKX are present in bovine chromaffin cells and that the regulation of [Ca(2+)](i) is probably more efficient with the participation of NCKX....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Cell biology
37,Background: In this study we evaluated the RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR for the detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of Mycoplasma (M.) dispar. M. bovis and M. bovirhinis. all three associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Primers and probes of the RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR are based on the V3/V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene of the three Mycoplasma species. Results: The analytical sensitivity of the RespoCheck triplex real-time PCR was. as determined by spiking experiments of the Mycoplasma strains in Phosphate Buffered Saline. 300 colony forming units (cfu)/mL for M. dispar. and 30 cfu/mL for M. bovis or M. bovirhinis. The analytical sensitivity of the RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCRwas. as determined on purified DNA. 10 fg DNA per assay for M. dispar and 100 fg fo rM. bovis and M. bovirhinis. The analytical specificity of the RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR was. as determined by testing Mycoplasmas strains (n = 17) and other bacterial strains (n = 107). 100. 98.2 and 99.1% for M. bovis. M. dispar and M. bovirhinis respectively. The RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR was compared with the PCR/DGGE analysis for M. bovis. M. dispar and M. bovirhinis respectively by testing 44 BALF samples from calves. Conclusion: In conclusion. the RespoCheck PCR assay can be a valuable tool for timely and accurate detection of three Mycoplasma species associated with in bovine respiratory disease....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Parkinson's Disease
38,Background: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is caused by growth of single or multiple species of pathogenic bacteria in lung tissue following stress and/or viral infection. Next generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR amplicons (NGS 16S amplicon analysis) is a powerful culture-independent open reference method that has recently been used to increase understanding of BRD-associated bacteria in the upper respiratory tract of BRD cattle. However. it has not yet been used to examine the microbiome of the bovine lower respiratory tract. The objective of this study was to use NGS 16S amplicon analysis to identify bacteria in post-mortem lung and lymph node tissue samples harvested from fatal BRD cases and clinically healthy animals. Cranial lobe and corresponding mediastinal lymph node post-mortem tissue samples were collected from calves diagnosed as BRD cases by veterinary laboratory pathologists and from clinically healthy calves. NGS 16S amplicon libraries. targeting the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Quantitative insights into microbial ecology (QIIME) was used to determine operational taxonomic units (OTUs) which corresponded to the 16S rRNA gene sequences. Results: Leptotrichiaceae. Mycoplasma. Pasteurellaceae. and Fusobacterium were the most abundant OTUs identified in the lungs and lymph nodes of the calves which died from BRD. Leptotrichiaceae. Fusobacterium. Mycoplasma. Trueperella and Bacteroides had greater relative abundances in post-mortem lung samples collected from fatal cases of BRD in dairy calves. compared with clinically healthy calves without lung lesions. Leptotrichiaceae. Mycoplasma and Pasteurellaceae showed higher relative abundances in post-mortem lymph node samples collected from fatal cases of BRD in dairy calves. compared with clinically healthy calves without lung lesions. Two Leptotrichiaceae sequence contigs were subsequently assembled from bacterial DNA-enriched shotgun sequences. Conclusions: The microbiomes of the cranial lung lobe and mediastinal lymph node from calves which died from BRD and from clinically healthy H-F calves have been characterised. Contigs corresponding to the abundant Leptotrichiaceae OTU were sequenced and found not to be identical to any known bacterial genus. This suggests that we have identified a novel bacterial species associated with BRD....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
39,Extrafetal tissues are a noncontroversial and inexhaustible source of mesenchymal stem cells that can be harvested noninvasively at low cost. In the veterinary field. as in man. stem cells derived from extrafetal tissues express plasticity. reduced immunogenicity. and have high anti-inflammatory potential making them promising candidates for treatment of many diseases. Umbilical cord mesenchymal cells have been isolated and characterized in different species and have recently been investigated as potential candidates in regenerative medicine. In this study. cells derived from bovine Wharton jelly (WJ) were isolated for the first time by enzymatic methods. frozen/thawed. cultivated for at least 10 passages. and characterized. Wharton jelly-derived cells readily attached to plastic culture dishes displaying typical fibroblast-like morphology and. although their proliferative capacity decreased to the seventh passage. these cells showed a mean doubling time of 34.55 +/- 6.33 hours and a mean frequency of one colony-forming unit fibroblast like for every 221.68 plated cells. The results of molecular biology studies and flow cytometry analyses revealed that WJ-derived cells showed the typical antigen profile of mesenchymal stem cells and were positive for CD29. CD44. CD105. CD166. Oct-4. and c-Myc. They were negative for CD34 and CD14. Remarkably. WJ-derived cells showed differentiation ability. After culture in induced media. WJ-derived cells were able to differentiate into osteogenic. adipogenic. chondrogenic. and neurogenic lines as shown by positive staining and expression of specific markers. On polymerase chain reaction analysis. these cells were negative for MHC-II and positive for MHC-I. thus reinforcing the role of extrafetal tissue as an allogenic source for bovine cell-based therapies. These results provide evidence that bovine WJ-derived cells may have the potential to differentiate to repair damaged tissues and reinforce the importance of extrafetal tissues as stem cell sources in veterinary regenerative medicine. A more detailed evaluation of their immunologic properties is necessary to better understand their potential role in cellular therapy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

40,Objective: Skeletal dysplasia with bowing long bones is a rare group of multiple characterized congenital anomalies. Materials and Methods: We introduce a simple. practical diagnostic flowchart that may be helpful in identifying the appropriate pathway of obstetrical management. Results: Herein. we describe four fetal cases of bent bony dysplasia that focus on ultrasound findings. phenotype. molecular tests. distinctive X-ray features. and chondral growth plate histology. The first case was a typical campomelic dysplasia resulting from a de novo mutation in the SOX9 gene. The second fetus was affected by osteogenesis imperfecta Type II carrying a mutation in the COLA1 gene. The third case was a rare presentation of campomelic dysplasia. Cumming type. in which SOX9 examination was normal. Subsequently. a femoral hypoplasia unusual fades syndrome is also discussed.

41,OBJECTIVE: To define the increased mRNA expression of Bpifb1. a member of the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein family. in parotid acinar cells from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. an animal model for Sjogren's syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Parotid acinar cells were prepared from female NOD (NOD/ShiJcl) mice with or without diabetes. as well as from control (C57BL/6JJcl) mice. Total RNA and homogenate were prepared from the parotid acinar cells. Embryonic cDNA from a Mouse MTC (TM) Panel I kit was used. The expression of Bpifb1 was determined by cDNA microarray analysis. RT-PCR. real-time PCR. northern blotting and in situ hybridization. RESULTS: The expression of Bpifb1 mRNA was high in parotid acinar cells from diabetic and non-diabetic NOD mice at 5-50 weeks of age. Acinar cells in the C57BL/6 mice had a low expression of Bpifb1 mRNA at an age >8 weeks. but had a relatively high expression in the foetus and infantile stages. CONCLUSIONS: Bpifb1 mRNA is upregulated in parotid acinar cells in NOD mice. but its expression is not related to the onset of diabetes. These findings suggest that high expression levels of Bpifb1 might predict disease traits before the onset of autoimmunity....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Diabetes
42,Previous studies have demonstrated that targeting bradykinin receptors is a promising strategy to counteract the cognitive impairment related with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampus is critical for cognition. and abnormalities in this brain region are linked to the decline in mental ability. Nevertheless. the impact of bradykinin signaling on hippocampal function is unknown. Therefore. we sought to determine the role of hippocampal bradykinin receptors B1R and B2R on the cognitive decline of middle-aged rats. Twelve-month-old rats exhibited impaired ability to acquire and retrieve spatial information in the Morris water maze task. A single intra-hippocampal injection of the selective B1R antagonist des-Arg(9)-[Leu(8)]-bradykinin (DALBK. 3 nmol). but not the selective B2R antagonist D-Arg-[Hyp(3).Thi(5).D-Tic(7).Oic(8)]-BK (Hoe 140. 3 nmol). reversed the spatial learning and memory deficits on these animals. However. both drugs did not affect the cognitive function in 3-month-old rats. suggesting absence of nootropic properties. Molecular biology analysis revealed an up-regulation of B1R expression in the hippocampal CA1 sub-region and in the pre-frontal cortex of 12-month-old rats. whereas no changes in the B2R expression were observed in middle-aged rats. These findings provide new evidence that inappropriate hippocampal B1R expression and activation exert a critical role on the spatial learning and memory deficits in middle-aged rats. Therefore. selective B1R antagonists. especially orally active non-peptide antagonists. may represent drugs of potential interest to counteract the age-related cognitive decline.

43,OBJECTIVE Recent advancements in molecular biology have identified the BRAF mutation as a common mutation in melanoma. The wide use of BRAF kinase inhibitor (BRAFi) in patients with metastatic melanoma has been established. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of BRAF mutation status and use of BRAFi in conjunction with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS This was a single-center retrospective study. Patient's charts and electronic records were reviewed for date of diagnosis of primary malignancy. BRAF mutation status. chemotherapies used. date of the diagnosis of CNS metastases. date of SRS. survival. local tumor control after SRS. and adverse events. Patients were divided into 3 groups: Group A. those with mutant BRAF without BRAFi treatment (13 patients); Group B. those with mutant BRAF with BRAFi treatment (17 patients); and Group C. those with wild-type BRAF (35 patients). Within a cohort of 65 patients with the known BRAF mutation status and treated with SRS between 2010 and 2014. 436 individual brain metastases (BMs) were identified. Kaplan-Meier methodology was then used to compare survival based on each binary parameter. RESULTS Median survival times after the diagnosis of melanoma BM and after SRS were favorable in patients with a BRAF mutation and treated with SRS in conjunction with BRAFi (Group B) compared with the patients with wild-type BRAF (Group C. 23 vs 8 months and 13 vs 5 months. respectively; p < 0.01. log-rank test). SRS provided a local tumor control rate of 89.4% in the entire cohort of patients. Furthermore. the local control rate was improved in the patients treated with SRS in conjunction with BRAFi (Group B) compared with patients with wild-type (Group C) or with BRAF mutation but no BRAFi (Group A) as an adjunct treatment for BMs. CONCLUSIONS BRAF mutation status appears to play an important role as a potent prognostic factor in patients harboring melanoma BM. BRAFi in conjunction with SRS may benefit this group of patients in terms of BM survival and SRS with an acceptable safety profile....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
44,Aim: Little is known about molecular biology of brain metastasis (BM) from colorectal cancer and its concordance with matched primary tumors. Materials & methods: We identified 56 consecutive colorectal cancer patients who underwent neurosurgical resection of BM. Tumor samples were tested for KRAS. NRAS. BRAF and PIK3CA. The molecular profile of the brain lesion was compared with the corresponding primary tumor. Results: The molecular profile concordance rate was 95.1%. Median survival after neurosurgery was 5.5 months (95% CI: 4.7-6.3); median overall survival was 24.0 months (95% CI: 15.6-32.4). Conclusion: In this cohort. we report a high frequency of KRAS mutations and a very high concordance rate between the molecular status of BM and that of matched primary tumors....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
45,BackgroundThe role of BRAF mutations in cancerogenesis has been demonstrated in several solid tumor types. However. in salivary gland tumors. this genetic alteration is very uncommon. and its role still remains unclear. Thus. the aim of this study was to analyze BRAF V600E (VE1) protein expression with BRAF mutation status in codon 600. in malignant and benign salivary gland tumors. MethodsStudies were performed on archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections derived from 95 patients who underwent surgery for tumors of the salivary gland. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) on tissue microarray slides was performed for evaluation of BRAF V600E (VE1) protein expression. and the automatic molecular diagnostics platform was used for the evaluation of mutations in codon 600 of BRAF gene. ResultsIHC cytoplasmic expression of BRAF V600E (VE1) protein was found in two of 95 cases: one case of adenocarcinoma NOS (one of three; 33%) and one case of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (one of five; 20%). Although. in IHC studies. nuclear BRAF V600E (VE1) protein expression was found in 14 (15%) of the analyzed cases: nine of 28 (32%) cases of pleomorphic adenoma. three of five (60%) cases of ductal carcinoma. one of nine (11%) case of mucoepidermoid carcinoma. and in one of five (20%) case of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. All cases were negative for polymerase chain reaction PCR-based analyses of BRAF mutations in codon 600. ConclusionsIn studied salivary gland cancers. no PCR-based prove mutations of BRAF V600 were detected. Further molecular analyses are necessary to rapid molecular arrays for the identification of specific mutations. optimal for individualized targeted therapies....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
46,To examine molecular events in hippocampus associated with aging and acupuncture effect. we employed cDNA arrays providing data of 588 genes to define transcriptional patterns. Male 8-month-old SAMP 10 and its homologous SAMR1 were selected and randomly divided into four groups: RI control group (Rc). P10 control group (PC). P10 acupuncture group (Pa) and PIO non-acupoint group (Pn). The points consisted Shanzhong (CV17). Zhongwan (CV12). Qihai (CV6). Zusanli (ST36) and Xuehai (SPIO). In Pa. we found that points stimuli could completely or partly reverse some genes expression profiles in hippocampus with aging. Simultaneously. some genes not related with brain aging were affected by acupuncture as well. Meanwhile. non-acupoint had some effect on aging-unrelated genes expression and little or negative effect on aging-related genes. We verified array results with RT-PCR and Northern blotting for three genes which are related to oxidative damage closely. including Hsp84. Hsp86 and YB-1. In conclusion. acupuncture Could be a potential intervention to retard molecular events with aging in mammals. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

47,As the most fascinating. complex. and dynamic part of our organism. the human brain is shaped by many interacting factors that not only are of neurobiological (including sex hormones) and environmental origin but are also sociocultural in their very nature (such as social roles). Gender is one of these factors. Most neurological. neurodevelopmental. neuropsychiatric. and psychosomatic disorders are characterized by impairments in visual social cognition (primarily body language reading and face perception) and a skewed sex ratio: females and males are affected differently in terms of clinical picture. prevalence. and severity. Is the social brain sex specific? This is still an open question. For a long time and for many reasons. sex differences have been overlooked or entirely ignored in neuroscience and biomedical research: there is a paucity of neuroimaging work examining sex differences in the social brain. However. the pattern of experimental behavioral data in both healthy. typically developing individuals and patients with deficient social cognition is beyond simple interpretation: contrary to popular wisdom. females are not always more proficient in understanding social signals. and their social abilities may be particularly affected by disease. Clarification of how neurobiological sex and sociocultural gender affect the social brain would provide novel insights into understanding gender-specific vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. This interaction is far beyond simplicity. Although sex differences represent a rather delicate topic. underestimation or exaggeration of possible effects retards progress in the field.

48,Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can help patients who have lost control over most muscles but are still conscious and able to communicate or interact with the environment. One of the most popular types of BCI is the P300-based BCI. With this BCI. users are asked to count the number of appearances of target stimuli in an experiment. To date. the majority of visual P300-based BCI systems developed have used the same character or picture as the target for every stimulus presentation. which can bore users. Consequently. users attention may decrease or be negatively affected by adjacent stimuli. Approach. In this study. a new stimulus is presented to increase user concentration. Honeycomb-shaped figures with 1-3 red dots were used as stimuli. The number and the positions of the red dots in the honeycomb-shaped figure were randomly changed during BCI control. The user was asked to count the number of the dots presented in each flash instead of the number of times they flashed. To assess the performance of this new stimulus. another honeycomb-shaped stimulus. without red dots. was used as a control condition. Main results. The results showed that the honeycomb-shaped stimuli with red dots obtained significantly higher classification accuracies and information transfer rates (p < 0.05) compared to the honeycomb-shaped stimulus without red dots. Significance. The results indicate that this proposed method can be a promising approach to improve the performance of the BCI system and can be an efficient method in daily application....,Psychology,Medical,Attention,Alzheimer's Disease
49,Social cognition refers to the ability to use social cues to infer the meaning and intentions behind the behaviour of others in order to respond in a socially adaptive manner. It is increasingly recognised that disorders of social cognition. including problems with emotion perception. theory of mind. conversational inference. morality judgements. decision making and social inhibition. characterise many developmental and psychiatric disorders and are highly relevant to many with acquired brain injuries or diseases. especially the frontotemporal dementias. This review provides an introduction and overview of the papers in this special edition on social cognition and places these in the context of other recent research. In doing so. several current issues in the clinical management of social cognition are delineated. Given that social cognition seems to be a sensitive predictor of psychosocial function. the assessment of social cognition is seen by many clinicians to be important although which profession is responsible is yet to be resolved. Issues in how social cognition are assessed are discussed. including the importance of context to social cognition. its interactive nature and the need to recognise influences such as family upbringing. gender and emotional state on social cognitive performance. There also needs to be development of tests that address all aspects of social cognition. including decision making and inhibition. Finally. this review discusses intervention research. Interventions are especially well developed in relation to schizophrenia. and less well developed in brain injury. These appear to be generally effective although treatments for emotional self-awareness are yet to be developed....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
50,Confronted with brain metastases (BM). pathologists aim to rule out a primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor and to identify or verify the primary tumor site to guide the clinician to specific therapies. Apart from morphological features. ancillary immunohistochemical analysis is the most effective tool for characterizing a metastatic neoplasm of unknown origin. A limited array of antibodies is used. taking into account relevant clinical information and the known brain tropism of lung cancer. breast cancer and melanoma. Recently. targeted therapies have enriched the therapeutic arsenal. in particular for patients with non-small cell lung cancer or melanoma and for patients carrying molecular anomalies. These therapies can lead to a substantial tumor response. brain metastases included. which justifies rapid determination of a molecular profile. To combine different tools and provide timely results. good tumor sample management and careful attention at the pre-analytical phase are critical. Appropriate strategies for molecular and immunohistochemical analysis are needed to identify theranostic markers. This article aims to review the anatomopathological diagnostic approach for BM in the age of targeted therapies....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
51,Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of brain metastases (BM). The identification of driver oncogenes and matched targeted therapies has improved outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; however. a better understanding of BM molecular biology is needed to further drive the process in this field. Methods: In this observational study. stage IV NSCLC patients tested for EGFR and KRAS mutations were selected. and BM incidence. recurrence and patients' outcome were assessed. Results: A total of 144 patients (142 Caucasian and two Asian) were selected. including 11.27% with EGFR-mutant and 33.10% with KRAS-mutant tumors. and 57.04% patients had developed BM. BM incidence was more frequent in patients with EGFR mutation according to multivariate analyses (MVA) (Odds ratio OR = 8.745 [1.743-43.881]. p = 0.008). Among patients with treated BM. recurrence after local treatment was less frequent in patients with KRAS mutation (OR = 0.234 [0.078-0.699]. p = 0.009). Among patients with untreated BM. overall survival (OS) was shorter for patients with KRAS mutation according to univariate analysis (OR = 7.130 [1.240-41.012]. p = 0.028). but not MVA. Conclusions: EGFR and KRAS mutations have a predictive role on BM incidence. recurrence and outcome in Caucasian NSCLC patients. These results may impact the routine management of disease in these patients. Further studies are required to assess the influence of other biomarkers on NSCLC BM....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
52,Brain single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). in particular. with perfusion agents or with neuroreceptor imaging radiopharmaceuticals. is rapidly becoming a clinical tool in many neurologic and psychiatric conditions. This imaging modality has been used for diagnosis. prognosis assessment. evaluation of response to therapy. risk stratification. detection of benign vs. malignant viable tissue. and the choice of medical or surgical therapy. We will present our institutional experience in this area. formatting a pictorial review of brain perfusion SPECT on more than 20 types of different neurologic and psychiatric diseases. such as dementia. epilepsy. cerebral palsy. head injury. brain tumor. herpes encephalitis. hypoxic brain damage. vacuities. depression. carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. and cocaine abuse. This is a demanding procedure as far as the need for trained and experienced physicians and personnel as well as advanced equipment are concerned. However. extraordinary useful clinical information achieved by this technology outweighs the existing challenge. More routine use of this procedure which is unfortunately underutilized in many countries including ours should be encouraged....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Mental Health
53,Numerous findings demonstrate that there is a strong association between maternal health during pregnancy and cardiovascular disease in adult offspring. The purpose of the present study was to test whether maternal gestational hypertension modulates brain renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and proinflammatory cytokines that sensitizes angiotensin II-elicited hypertensive response in adult offspring. In addition. the role of renal nerves and the RAAS in the sensitization process was investigated. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses of structures of the lamina terminalis and paraventricular nucleus indicated upregulation of mRNA expression of several RAAS components and proinflammatory cytokines in 10-week-old male offspring of hypertensive dams. Most of these increases were significantly inhibited by either renal denervation performed at 8 weeks of age or treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. captopril. in drinking water starting at weaning. When tested beginning at 10 weeks of age. a pressor dose of angiotensin II resulted in enhanced upregulation of mRNA expression of RAAS components and proinflammatory cytokines in the lamina terminalis and paraventricular nucleus and an augmented pressor response in male offspring of hypertensive dams. The augmented blood pressure change and most of the increases in gene expression in the offspring were abolished by either renal denervation or captopril. The results suggest that maternal hypertension during pregnancy enhances pressor responses to angiotensin II through overactivity of renal nerves and the RAAS in male offspring and that upregulation of the brain RAAS and proinflammatory cytokines in these offspring may contribute to maternal gestational hypertension-induced sensitization of the hypertensive response to angiotensin II....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Kidney Health
54,Basic helix-loop-helix PAS domain proteins form a growing family of transcription factors. These proteins are involved in the process of adaptation to cellular stresses and environmental factors such as a change in oxygen concentration. We describe the identification and characterization of a recently cloned PAS domain protein termed Npas4 in ischemic rat brain. Using gene expression profiling following middle cerebral artery occlusion. we showed that the Npas4 mRNA is differentially expressed in ischemic tissue. The full-length gene was cloned from rat brain and its spatial and temporal expression characterized with in situ hybridization and Northern blotting. The Npas4 mRNA is specifically expressed in the brain and is highly up-regulated in ischemic tissues following both focal and global cerebral ischemic insults. Immunohistochemistry revealed a strong expression in the limbic system and thalamus. as well as in layers 3 and 5 in the cortex of the unchallenged brain. When overexpressed in HEK 293 cells. Npas4 appears as a protein of similar to 100 kDa. In brain samples. however. in addition to the 100 kDa band a specific 200 kDa immunoreactive band was also detected. Ischemic challenge lead to a decrease in the 200 kDa form and a simultaneous increase in the 100 kDa immunoreactivity. This could indicate a novel regulatory mechanism for activation and/or deactivation of this protein in response to ischemic brain injury....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Parkinson's Disease
55,Although. overwhelmingly. behavior is similar in males and females. and. correspondingly. the brains are similar. sex differences permeate both brain and behavioral measures. and these differences have been the focus of increasing scrutiny by neuroscientists. This Review describes milestones from more than 3 decades of research in brain and behavior. This research was necessarily bound by available methodology. and we began with indirect behavioral indicators of brain function such as handedness. We proceeded to the use of neuropsychological batteries and then to structural and functional neuroimaging that provided the foundations of a cognitive neuroscience-based computerized neurocognitive battery. Sex differences were apparent and consistent in neurocognitive measures. with females performing better on memory and social cognition tasks and males on spatial processing and motor speed. Sex differences were also prominent in all major brain parameters. including higher rates of cerebral blood flow. higher percentage of gray matter tissue. and higher interhemispheric connectivity in females. compared with higher percentage of white matter and greater intrahemispheric connectivity as well as higher glucose metabolism in limbic regions in males. Many of these differences are present in childhood. but they become more prominent with adolescence. perhaps linked to puberty. Overall. they indicate complementarity between the sexes that would result in greater adaptive diversity. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals. Inc....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Gender roles
56,One-third of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment often display symptoms of depression leading to poor adherence and decreased quality of life. Thus. this study aimed to investigate the possible protective effect of nebivolol against cisplatin-associated depressive symptoms in adult male rats. Nebivolol is a highly cardioselective -adrenergic receptor blocker that possesses endothelium-dependent vasodilator properties and antioxidant capacities. Animals were allocated into four groups. Group one was given aqueous solution of carboxymethyl cellulose and served as control. group two was given nebivolol (10mg/kg p.o.. daily). group three was given cisplatin (2mg/kg i.p. once per week) for 10 consecutive weeks and group four was treated with cisplatin concomitantly with nebivolol as per above schedule. Cisplatin-treated rats showed an increase in both depressive-like behaviors in open-field and forced swimming tests. In addition. histopathological examination revealed cortical encephalomalacia along with hippocampal neuronal degeneration and kidney dysfunction. In parallel. cisplatin administration prominently reduced GABA and elevated glutamate levels in the cortical and hippocampal tissues. Furthermore. it resulted in a significant decline in cortical and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nitric oxide contents concomitantly with a marked decrease in endothelial- and an increase in inducible-nitric oxide synthase genes expression. On the other hand. treatment with nebivolol effectively mitigated the aforementioned cisplatin-associated behavioral. biochemical. and histopathological alterations without changing its antitumor activity as evidenced by sulforhodamine B cell survival assay. Taken together. our results suggest that nebivolol may offer a promising approach for alleviating depressive symptoms associated with the use of cisplatin....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Depression
57,Background: Preclinical and clinical evidence supports the concept of bidirectional brain-gut microbiome interactions. We aimed to determine if subgroups of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subjects can be identified based on differences in gut microbial composition. and if there are correlations between gut microbial measures and structural brain signatures in IBS. Methods: Behavioral measures. stool samples. and structural brain images were collected from 29 adult IBS and 23 healthy control subjects (HCs). 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was used to profile stool microbial communities. and various multivariate analysis approaches were used to quantitate microbial composition. abundance. and diversity. The metagenomic content of samples was inferred from 16S rRNA gene sequence data using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt). T1-weighted brain images were acquired on a Siemens Allegra 3T scanner. and morphological measures were computed for 165 brain regions. Results: Using unweighted Unifrac distances with hierarchical clustering on microbial data. samples were clustered into two IBS subgroups within the IBS population (IBS1 (n = 13) and HC-like IBS (n = 16)) and HCs (n = 23) (AUROC = 0.96. sensitivity 0.95. specificity 0.67). A Random Forest classifier provided further support for the differentiation of IBS1 and HC groups. Microbes belonging to the genera Faecalibacterium. Blautia. and Bacteroides contributed to this subclassification. Clinical features distinguishing the groups included a history of early life trauma and duration of symptoms (greater in IBS1). but not self-reported bowel habits. anxiety. depression. or medication use. Gut microbial composition correlated with structural measures of brain regions including sensory-and salience-related regions. and with a history of early life trauma. Conclusions: The results confirm previous reports of gut microbiome-based IBS subgroups and identify for the first time brain structural alterations associated with these subgroups. They provide preliminary evidence for the involvement of specific microbes and their predicted metabolites in these correlations....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Irritable Bowel Syndrome
58,(R)ecent advances in deep brain stimulators and brain -machine interfaces have greatly expanded the possibilities of neuroprosthetics and neuromodulation. Together with advances in neuroengineering. nanotechnology. molecular biology and material sciences. it is now possible to address fundamental questions in neuroscience in new. more powerful ways. It is now possible to apply these new technologies in ways that range from augmenting and restoring function to neuromodulation modalities that treat neuropsychiatric disorders. Recent developments in neuromodulation methods offer significant advantages and potential clinical benefits for a variety of disorders. Here we describe the current state of the art in neuromodulation methods. and some advances in brain -machine interfaces. describing the advantages and limitations of the clinical applications of each method.

59,Introduction. - Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) constitute 10-15% of all brain tumors in the pediatric population; currently prognosis remains poor. with an overall survival of 7-14 months. Recently the indication of DIPG biopsy has been enlarged due to the development of molecular biology and various ongoing clinical and therapeutic trials. Classically a biopsy is performed using a stereotactic frame assisted procedure but the workflow may sometimes be heavy and more complex especially in children. In this study the authors present their experience with frameless robotic-guided biopsy of DIPG in a pediatric population. Patients and methods. - Retrospective study on a series of five consecutive pediatric patients harboring DIPG treated over a 4-year period. All patients underwent frameless robotic-guided biopsy via a transcerebellar approach. Results. - Among the 5 patients studied 3 were male and 2 female with a median age of 8.6 years [range 5 to 13 years]. Clinical presentation included ataxia. hemiparesis and cranial nerve palsy in all patients. MRI imaging of the lesion showed typical DIPG features (3 of them located in the pons) with hypo-intensity on T1 and hyper-intensity signal on T2 sequences and diffuse gadolinium enhancement. The mean procedure time was 56 minutes (range 45 to 67 minutes). No new postoperative neurological deficits were recorded. Histological diagnosis was achieved in all cases as follows: two anaplastic astrocytomas (grade III). two glioblastomas. and one diffuse astrocytoma (grade III). Conclusion. - Frameless robotic assisted biopsy of DIPG in pediatric population is an easier. effective. safe and highly accurate method to achieve diagnosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

60,Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a malignant brain tumor of childhood that carries an extremely poor prognosis. There are similar to 200-300 new cases diagnosed each year. [1. 2] and little progress has been made in changing the prognosis and outcome of the tumor since it was first documented in the literature in 1926 [3]. The median overall survival is 8-11 months [4]. with an overall survival rate of 30% at 1 year. and less than 10% at 2 years [4]. This review will provide background information on DIPGs. a historical look at the trends in caring for DIPG. and current trends in diagnosis and treatment. By changing the way we care for these terminal tumors. we can work towards having a better understanding of the underlying molecular biology. and attempt to develop better chemotherapeutic tools to combat the disease....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
61,We study the energy dispatch of power distribution networks (PDNs) coupled with urban transportation networks. The electricity demand at each charging/swapping facility is influenced by the arrival rates and charging requests of electric vehicles. which further depends on the spatial distribution of traffic flows over the entire transportation system. We consider the impact of the road congestion on route choices of vehicles from a system-level perspective. The traffic flow pattern in steady state is characterized by the Wardrop user equilibrium. We consider the PDN load perturbation caused by the traffic demand uncertainty. and propose a robust dispatch method that maintains the feasibility of an alternating current power flow constraints. By applying the convex relaxation to nonlinear branch power flow equations. the proposed model yields a two-stage robust convex optimization problem with an implicit uncertainty set. Moreover. a decomposition framework is proposed. in which the first phase determines the uncertainty set of electricity demand by solving two traffic assignment problems associated with the extreme scenarios. and the second phase solves a two-stage robust second-order cone program following a delayed constraint generation framework. Several issues regarding the scalability and conservatism are elaborated. Case studies corroborate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electrical network
62,Three genes. gnd. pgl. and fbp. relevant to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were overexpressed in Corynebacterium glutamicum IWJ001. leading to increase of L-isoleucine production. The transcriptional levels of gnd. pgl. and fbp significantly increased in IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp-pgl. Compared with the control strain IWJ001/pDXW-8. intracellular NADPH/NADP(+) ratios in IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd and IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp cells grown for 36 H increased threefold and fourfold. respectively. indicating that overexpression of gnd and fbp redirected the carbon flux to PPP. Intracellular NADPH/NADP(+) ratio in IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp-pgl grown for 36 H was similar to IWJ001/pDXW-8. suggesting that the NADPH produced by PPP could be quickly consumed for L-isoleucine production. 10.9 and 28.96 g/L of L-isoleucine was produced in IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp-pgl in shake flask cultivation and fed-batch fermentation. respectively. In addition. IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp-pgl grew fast. its dry cell weight reached 49 g/L after 48 H. whereas the start strain IWJ001/pDXW-8 reached only 40 g/L. After 96 H fermentation. L-isoleucine yield on glucose in IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp-pgl reached 0.138 g/g. The results demonstrate that carbon flux redirection to PPP is an efficient approach to enhance L-isoleucine production in C. glutamicum.

63,Background: During embryogenesis. tight regulation of retinoic acid (RA) availability is fundamental for normal development. In parallel to RA synthesis. a negative feedback loop controlled by RA catabolizing enzymes of the cytochrome P450 subfamily 26 (CYP26) is crucial. In vertebrates. the functions of the three CYP26 enzymes (CYP26A1. CYP26B1. and CYP26C1) have been well characterized. By contrast. outside vertebrates. little is known about CYP26 complements and their biological roles. In an effort to characterize the evolutionary diversification of RA catabolism. we studied the CYP26 genes of the cephalochordate amphioxus (Branchiostoma lanceolatum). a basal chordate with a vertebrate-like genome that has not undergone the massive. large-scale duplications of vertebrates. Results: In the present study. we found that amphioxus also possess three CYP26 genes (CYP26-1. CYP26-2. and CYP26-3) that are clustered in the genome and originated by lineage-specific duplication. The amphioxus CYP26 cluster thus represents a useful model to assess adaptive evolutionary changes of the RA signaling system following gene duplication. The characterization of amphioxus CYP26 expression. function. and regulation by RA signaling demonstrated that. despite the independent origins of CYP26 duplicates in amphioxus and vertebrates. they convergently assume two main roles during development: RA-dependent patterning and protection against fluctuations of RA levels. Our analysis suggested that in amphioxus RA-dependent patterning is sustained by CYP26-2. while RA homeostasis is mediated by CYP26-1 and CYP26-3. Furthermore. comparisons of the regulatory regions of CYP26 genes of different bilaterian animals indicated that a CYP26-driven negative feedback system was present in the last common ancestor of deuterostomes. but not in that of bilaterians. Conclusions: Altogether. this work reveals the evolutionary origins of the RA-dependent regulation of CYP26 genes and highlights convergent functions for CYP26 enzymes that originated by independent duplication events. hence establishing a novel selective mechanism for the genomic retention of gene duplicates....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Genetics
64,BACKGROUND: Glutamine synthetase (GS; EC 6.3.1.2) is a key enzyme of nitrogen (N) assimilation. catalysing the synthesis of glutamine from ammonium and glutamate. Plants have two types of GS isoenzyme that are localised in different compartments: one in the cytosol (GS1) and the other in the chloroplast (G52). GS1 is the major form of GS in plant roots and directly converts ammonium taken up by plant roots to glutamine. RESULTS: The GS1 gene cDNA of non-heading Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris ssp. chinensis Makino) cultivar 'Suzhouqing' was isolated by RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction) and (5'/3')-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) techniques. It was classified as GS1 by sequence alignment and motif search and named B. campestris ssp. chinensis Makino GS1 (BcGS1). Subcellular localisation analysis showed that BcGS1 was distributed in the cytoplasm of cells. BcGS1 was expressed in all parts. but mainly in the roots. which was verified by northern blotting analysis. Additionally. its expression was influenced by the N source concentration. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that BcGS1 is a novel member of the GS family in plants. BcGS1 was significantly related to N assimilation in non-heading Chinese cabbage. demonstrating that this gene plays an important role in plant growth and development.

65,FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). which encodes a MADS-box domain protein. is a flowering repressor involved in the key position of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) flowering network. In Brassica species. several FLC homologues are involved in flowering time like Arabidopsis FLC. Here. we report the analysis of splicing variation in BrpFLC1 and the expression of BrpFLC homologues associated with early flowering of Purple Flowering Stalk (Brassica campestris L. ssp. chinensis L. var. purpurea Bailey). It was indicated that a splice site mutation happened in intron 6 with G to A at the 5' splice site. Three alternative splicing patterns of BrpFLC1. including the entire exon 6 excluded and 24 bp or 87 bp of intron 6 retained. were identified in Purple Flowering Stalk. But there was only one normal splicing pattern in Pakchoi (Brassica campestris ssp. chinensis var. communis). Northern blotting and semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the expression levels of the three FLC homologues in Purple Flowering Stalk were lower than that in Pakchoi. However. the expression levels of downstream genes. SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). were higher in Purple Flowering Stalk. These results suggest that a natural splicing site mutation in BrpFLC1 gene and repressed expression of all BrpFLC genes contribute significantly to flowering time variation in Purple Flowering Stalk....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
66,The polygalacturonase (PG) gene family has been found to be enriched in pollen of several species; however. little is currently known about the function of the PG gene in pollen development. To investigate the exact role that the PG gene has played in pollen development and about this family in general. one putative PG gene. Brassica campestris Male Fertility 9 (BcMF9). was isolated from Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris ssp. chinensis. syn. B. rapa ssp. chinensis) and characterized. RT-PCR. northern blotting and in situ hybridization were used to analyse the expression pattern of BcMF9. and antisense RNA technology was applied to study the function of this gene. BcMF9 is expressed in particular in the tapetum and microspore during the late stages of pollen development. Antisense RNA transgenic plants that displayed decreased expression of BcMF9 showed pollen morphological defects that resulted in reduced pollen germination efficiency. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the homogeneous pectic exintine layer of pollen facing the exterior was over-developed and predominantly occupied the intine. reversing the normal proportional distribution of the internal endintine layer and the external exintine in transgenic pollen. Inhibition of BcMF9 also resulted in break-up of the previously formed tectum and baculae from the beginning of the binucleate stage. as a result of premature degradation of tapetum. Several lines of evidence. including patterns of BcMF9 expression and phenotypic defects. suggest a sporophytic role in exine patterning. and a gametophytic mode of action of BcMF9 in intine formation. BcMF9 might act as a co-ordinator in the late stages of tapetum degeneration. and subsequently in the regulation of wall material secretion and. in turn. exine formation. BcMF9 might also play a role in intine formation. possibly via regulation of the dynamic metabolism of pectin....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
67,Based on the significant differences in the resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum between two Brassica napus cultivars. ZhongR888 and Zhongyou821. near isogenic lines (NILs) were established. The resistance differences between Zhongyou821 and BC5 progeny (the fifth generation from a cross between Zhongyou821 and ZhongR888 with Zhongyou821 as successive backcross parent) was displayed by cDNA-AFLP and differential transcripts-derived fragments (TDFs). The full-length cDNA of 1.707 bp with 1.323 bp open reading frame (ORF. open box). named Rsk was identified by RT-RACE from the resistance related fragment 40-2 in Zhongyou821. It encoded a protein of 440 amino acid residues. which contained a putative extracellular domain. a transmembrane domain. and an intracellular domain. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of Rsk revealed that it had high homology to Arabidopsis thaliana kinase involved in protein binding. and had a conserved region of LRR-RI. indicating it might be a member of leucine-rich repeats. ribonuclease inhibitor-like subfamily. DNA sequences of 1.685 bp and 1.703 bp without an intron were also identified from Zhongyou821 and BC5. respectively. Expression analysis showed that Rsk might play a role in disease resistance pathways....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Molecular biology
68,Oilseeds of the plant family Brassicaceae are important for providing both lipid and protein contents to human nutrition. Cruciferins (12S globulins) are seed storage proteins. which are getting attention due to their allergenic and pathogenicity related nature. This study describes the purification and characterization of a trimeric (similar to 190 kDa) cruciferin protein from the seeds of Brassica nigra (L). Cruciferin was first partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (30% saturation constant) and further purified by size exclusion chromatography. The N-terminal amino-acid sequence analysis showed 82% sequence homology with cruciferin from Arabidopsis thaliana. The 50-55 kDa monomeric cruciferin produced multiple bands of two major molecular weight ranges (a-polypeptides of 28-32 kDa and (beta-polypeptides of 17-20 kDa) under reduced conditions of SDS-PAGE. The 2D gel electrophoretic analysis showed the further separation of the bands into their isoforms with major pI ranges between 5.7 and 8.0 (a-poly peptides) and 5.5-8.5 (beta-polypeptides). The Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) showed the monodisperse nature of the cruciferin with hydrodynamic radius of 5.8 +/- 0.1 nm confirming the trimeric nature of the protein. The Circular Dichroism (CD) spectra showed both a-helices and beta-sheets in the native conformation of the trimeric protein. The pure cruciferin protein (40 mg/m1) was successfully crystallized; however. the crystals diffracted only to low resolution data (8 A). Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) was applied to gain insights into the three-dimensional structure in solution. SAXS showed that the radius of gyration is 4.24 +/- 0.25 nm and confirmed the nearly globular shape. The SAXS based ab initio dummy model of B. nigra cruciferin was compared with 11S globulins (PDB ID: 3KGL) of B. napus which further confirmed a highly similar molecular weight and globular shape indicating a conserved trimerization of B. nigra cruciferin. The comparison of the scattering patterns of both proteins showed a minimized x(2)-value of 1.337 confirming a similar molecular structure. This is the first report describing the purification and characterization of a cruciferin protein from seeds of B. nigra. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

69,The species Brassica rapa includes various vegetable crops. Production of these vegetable crops is usually impaired by heat stress. Some microRNAs (miRNAs) in Arabidopsis have been considered to mediate gene silencing in plant response to abiotic stress. However. it remains unknown whether or what miRNAs play a role in heat resistance of B. rapa. To identify genomewide conserved and novel miRNAs that are responsive to heat stress in B. rapa. we defined temperature thresholds of non-heading Chinese cabbage (B. rapa ssp. chinensis) and constructed small RNA libraries from the seedlings that had been exposed to high temperature (46 degrees C) for 1 h. By deep sequencing and data analysis. we selected a series of conserved and novel miRNAs that responded to heat stress. In total. Chinese cabbage shares at least 35 conserved miRNA families with Arabidopsis thaliana. Among them. five miRNA families were responsive to heat stress. Northern hybridization and real-time PCR showed that the conserved miRNAs bra-miR398a and bra-miR398b were heat-inhibitive and guided heat response of their target gene. BracCSD1; and bra-miR156h and bra-miR156g were heat-induced and its putative target BracSPL2 was down-regulated. According to the criteria of miRNA and miRNA* that form a duplex. 21 novel miRNAs belonging to 19 miRNA families were predicted. Of these. four were identified to be heat-responsive by Northern blotting and/or expression analysis of the putative targets. The two novel miRNAs bra-miR1885b.3 and bra-miR5718 negatively regulated their putative target genes. 5'-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR indicated that three novel miRNAs cleaved the transcripts of their target genes where their precursors may have evolved from. These results broaden our perspective on the important role of miRNA in plant responses to heat....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,DNA/RNA sequencing
70,Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of epithelial ovarian cancer have led to the development of a number of targeted therapies. including poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. PARP inhibitors are a novel class of therapeutic agents that target tumors with deficiencies in the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway. Early studies have shown significant efficacy for PARP inhibitors in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. It has become evident that BRCA wild-type patients with other defects in the homologous recombination repair pathway benefit from this therapeutic approach. Importantly. companion homologous recombination deficiency scores are being developed to help guide the selection of patients most likely to gain clinical benefit from PARP inhibition. Olaparib. the first and most extensively investigated PARP inhibitor. is now licensed in Europe for maintenance treatment of patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed BRCA-mutated (germ-line or somatic) high-grade serous ovarian cancer who have responded to platinum-based chemotherapy. In the United States. olaparib is licensed for treatment of patients with germline BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer who have received 3 or more lines of chemotherapy. There are a number of other PARP inhibitors in late phase clinical development in ovarian cancer including rucaparib. niraparib. veliparib. and talazoparib. This review will focus on the current evidence for PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer and discuss ongoing clinical trials and future research directions in this rapidly evolving area....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
71,Germline BRCA2 mutations are the first known cause of inherited (familial) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This tumor is the third most frequent cancer in carriers of germline BRCA2 mutations. as it occurs in around 10% of BRCA2 families. PDAC is known as one of the most highly lethal cancers. mainly because of its chemoresistance and frequently late diagnosis. Based on recent developments in molecular biology. a subgroup of BRCA2-associated PDAC has been created. allowing screening. early surgical treatment and personalized systemic treatment. BRCA2 germline mutation carriers who have >= 1 first-degree relative. or >= 2 blood relatives with PDAC. should undergo screening and regular follow-up based on magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic ultrasound. The goal of screening is to detect early invasive PDAC and advanced precancerous lesions suitable for a stepwise surgical complete (R0) resection. Increasing evidence on the molecular role of the BRCA2 protein in the homologous recombination of DNA damages suggest that BRCA2-related PDAC are sensitive to agents causing DNA cross-linking damage. such as platinum salts. and treatments targeting rescue DNA repair pathways. such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors that are currently under investigation....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
72,Aims: NUT midline carcinoma (NMC) is a rare undifferentiated and aggressive carcinoma that locates characteristically to the midline of the head and neck. and mediastinum. NMC is characterized by chromosomal rearrangements of the gene NUT. at 15q14. The BRD4 gene on 19q13 is the most common translocation partner forming a fusion oncogene. BRD4-NUT. By the end of 2014. the International NUT Midline Carcinoma Registry had 48 patients treated for NMC. Laryngeal NMC are exceedingly rare. and we report a case series of seven cases. Methods and results: We searched for cases in files of different hospitals as well as a thorough search of the English language literature. The diagnosis of NMC is made by demonstration of NUT rearrangement either by immunohistochemistry. fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We found three previously published cases. and in this series add four cases of our own. Conclusions: NMC consists of monomorphic. often discohesive. cells with an epithelioid appearance and distinct nucleoli. The tumours typically show abrupt squamous differentiation. The mean age of the patients was 34 years. hence significantly lower than that for conventional laryngeal carcinoma. All tumours were located in the supraglottis and five patients died of the disease after 3. 7. 8. 9 and 11 months. Laryngeal NMC may be underdiagnosed. and an increased awareness among pathologists is warranted. NMC has characteristic morphological features. and positive immunostaining with the NUT antibody is diagnostic. Its aggressive behaviour demands a very intense treatment strategy and the need for its recognition is emphasized further by new promising treatment strategies....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
73,Irinotecan is a natural alkaloid agent widely used in cancer therapy. High-mobility group protein B1 as a non-histone chromosomal protein plays a fundamental role in gene expression and inflammation. In this study. the effect of irinotecan on high-mobility group protein B1 and MMP9 content. gene expression. cell cycle. and cell growth in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) was investigated. The cells were exposed to various concentrations of irinotecan and the viability determined by trypan blue exclusion and 3-(4.5-dimethylthiazal-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. High-mobility group B proteins were extracted from the control and drug-treated cells and analyzed by immunoblot. High-mobility group protein B1 and MMP9 messenger RNA expression was studied by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrated reduction of cell viability upon increasing irinotecan concentration. up-regulated high-mobility group protein B1 gene expression. and down-regulated MMP9 mRNA. Although the content of high-mobility group protein B1 was decreased in chromatin extract upon drug action. no high-mobility group protein B1 release to extracellular space was detected by immunoblot analysis. Irinotecan decreased H3K9 acetylation and increased poly ADP-ribose polymerase fragmentation to 89 kDa and anion superoxide production suggesting induction of apoptosis in these cells. Propidium iodide staining of the cells 24 h after the drug treatment revealed arrest of the cells in S-phase. From the results. it is concluded that overexpression of high-mobility group protein B1 in the presence of irinotecan precedes breast cancer cells into apoptosis and in this response the binding of irinotecan to chromatin or high-mobility group protein B1 may condense/aggregate chromatin. preventing high-mobility group protein B1 release from chromatin....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
74,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy. that is. the administration of chemotherapy before surgery. has been commonly used for locally advanced breast cancer to improve the surgical outcomes and increase the opportunity for breast-conserving therapy. Women with breast cancer often receive an anthracycline-based regimen as the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. which is associated with a high risk of emesis. Despite the development of novel antiemetics. chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) has been commonly reported as a major adverse effect. affecting the quality of life of the patients. However. the factors predicting CINV in women with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy remain unclear. In this single-institution. prospective. observational study conducted at an outpatient cancer centre in the Republic of Korea from November 2013 to March 2016. we analysed women with breast cancer who planned to be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. Candidate factors associated with CINV were assessed before neoadjuvant chemotherapy using the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. CINV was assessed after chemotherapy by using the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer Antiemesis Tool. Of a total of 143 participants. 7 patients were lost to follow-up and 2 patients were excluded due to changes in their treatment plan; thus. 134 patients were finally included in the analyses. Overall. 48.5% of the participants experienced CINV. with delayed CINV prevalence (42.5%) being more common than acute (39.6%). In the univariate analyses. overall CINV was significantly associated with late chronotypes (odds ratio [OR]. 3.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]. 1.37-8.87; p = 0.009). a history of nausea/vomiting (OR. 2.19; 95% CI. 1.10-4.37; p = 0.026) and anxiety (OR. 2.25; 95% CI. 1.05-4.81; p = 0.036). In the multivariate analyses. late chronotypes (OR. 3.53; 95% CI. 1.27-9.79; p = 0.015) and a history of nausea/vomiting (OR. 2.83; 95% CI. 1.31-6.13; p = 0.008) remained significantly associated with CINV. In conclusion. in women with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. late chronotypes were found to have an increased risk of CINV; these data suggest that clinicians need to assess and consider the chronotype in the management of CINV....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Cancer
75,The present study tested the supposition that greater levels of couple identity (or we-ness) increase a woman's coping self-efficacy in relation to breast cancer. which. in turn. predicts better psychosocial adjustment. Women (N = 112) in committed relationships completed surveys assessing their levels of couple identity. cancer coping self-efficacy. and aspects of their psychosocial adjustment (specifically. depression. anxiety and functional well-being) during one of their outpatient visits to the cancer centre. As predicted. the more women identified with their relationships. the lower their levels of depression and anxiety were and the greater their functional well-being was. This relationship was mediated by coping self-efficacy: greater identification with one's relationship predicted greater confidence in one's ability to cope. which. in turn. predicted better adjustment. The role intimate relationships play in women's adjustment to breast cancer. as well as directions for further research. are discussed....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Social cognition
76,Background: High levels of distress are expected shortly after the diagnosis breast cancer. The Distress Thermometer (DT) is commonly used to screen for distress. using a cutoff score of 4 or 5; however. this score might not be appropriate for detecting distress in women with recently diagnosed breast cancer. Objectives: The aims of this study were to establish the optimal DT cutoff score for detecting high distress shortly after breast cancer diagnosis and to correlate this score with the reported problems. Methods: We selected for this study Dutch women who completed the DT and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale within 1 month after breast cancer diagnosis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis of DT scores was performed. with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale being used as the criterion standard for the level of distress. The sensitivity. specificity. positive predictive value. and negative predictive value of each DT score were calculated. Results: In total. 181 women participated in the study. The optimal DT cutoff score for detecting distress was 7 with a sensitivity of 0.73. specificity of 0.84. positive predictive value of 69%. and negative predictive value of 87%. Emotional problems were the most frequently reported concerns. Conclusion: We consider a cutoff score of 7. shortly after breast cancer is diagnosed. optimal to identify those women with high distress and therefore at risk of chronic distress. Implications for Practice: The findings are clinically important because they can enable healthcare professionals to direct their time and resources to those most in need of their assistance....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Cancer
77,Treatment strategies in oncology are nowadays largely based on the "target therapy model". which allows to personalize the cure of each patient depending on distinctive host and disease features. As a general concept "targeted drugs" are effective only when the tumor exhibits the "target". which in breast cancer pathology may correspond to the expression of estrogen receptors and/or of HER2. These biomarkers are evaluated on breast cancer tissues by companion diagnostic tests. however. evidence suggests that the first step in breast cancer predictive pathology is still represented by morphology. For instance. histological types. such as tubular and cribriform carcinomas. define patients who may not need any treatments other than surgical excision. Neoadjuvant studies have shown that patients affected by lobular carcinomas are not likely to have any beneficial effects from chemotherapy. The second step in prediction is represented by immunophenotyping. If the immunohistochemical evaluation of four markers (estrogen and progesterone receptors. HER2 and Ki67) remains the best practice for breast cancer predictive pathology. molecular pathology has certainly reshaped the way we approach breast cancer diagnosis. The aim of this review is to discuss current knowledge in predictive pathology for the management of breast cancer patients. focusing on the benefits and drawbacks of traditional tools and of novel improvements of molecular biology....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
78,Although breast cancer is becoming more prevalent in Africa. few epidemiologic studies have been undertaken and appropriate methodologic approaches remain uncertain. We therefore conducted a population-based case-control study in Accra and Kumasi. Ghana. enrolling 2.202 women with lesions suspicious for breast cancer and 2.161 population controls. Biopsy tissue for cases prior to neoadjuvant therapy (if given). blood. saliva and fecal samples were sought for study subjects. Response rates. risk factor prevalences and odds ratios for established breast cancer risk factors were calculated. A total of 54.5% of the recruited cases were diagnosed with malignancies. 36.0% with benign conditions and 9.5% with indeterminate diagnoses. Response rates to interviews were 99.2% in cases and 91.9% in controls. with the vast majority of interviewed subjects providing saliva (97.9% in cases vs. 98.8% in controls) and blood (91.8% vs. 82.5%) samples; lower proportions (58.1% vs. 46.1%) provided fecal samples. While risk factor prevalences were unique as compared to women in other countries (e.g.. less education. higher parity). cancer risk factors resembled patterns identified elsewhere (elevated risks associated with higher levels of education. familial histories of breast cancer. low parity and larger body sizes). Subjects with benign conditions were younger and exhibited higher socioeconomic profiles (e.g.. higher education and lower parity) than those with malignancies. suggesting selective referral influences. While further defining breast cancer risk factors in Africa. this study showed that successful population-based interdisciplinary studies of cancer in Africa are possible but require close attention to diagnostic referral biases and standardized and documented approaches for high-quality data collection. including biospecimens. What's new? Breast cancer incidence is rising rapidly throughout Africa. but few epidemiologic or molecular studies have been undertaken there. Best practices for study design are yet to be established. In this study. the authors discuss factors such as recruitment. data collection and biological sample collection. They found that the prevalence of various risk factors differed but the magnitudes of associations were similar to those observed elsewhere. These methods and results indicate that successful studies in Africa are possible. despite many challenges....,Psychology,Medical,Attention,Cancer
79,Background: Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among females. Genetic polymorphisms might have a role in carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether C to T base substitution within TaqI Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene (rs731236) in exon 9 was a risk factor among patients with breast cancer. Methods: Peripheral blood was drawn from 122 Jordanian breast cancer patients and 100 healthy Jordanian volunteers in Al-Basheer Hospital during the summer months (from June to November of 2013. 2014. and 2015). DNA was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). followed by TaqI restriction enzyme digestion. Quantification of serum 25-hydroxy Vitamin D (25[OH] D) level was determined by competitive immunoassay Elecsys. Results: Genotypic frequencies for TaqI TT. Tt. and tt genotypes were 41%. 46%. and 13% for breast cancer compared to 42%. 50%. and 8% for control. respectively. Vitamin D serum level was significantly lower in the breast cancer patients (8.1 +/- 0.3 ng/ml) compared to the control group (21.2 +/- 0.6 ng/ml; P = 0.001). This study showed an inverse association between 25(OH) D serum level and breast cancer risk (odds ratio [OR]. 22.72. 95% confidence interval [CI]. 10.06-51.29). Conclusions: An inverse association was found between 25(OH)D serum level and breast cancer risk. Statistical difference was also found between different VDR TaqI genotypes and circulating levels of 25(OH) D among Jordanian females with breast cancer....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
80,Breast carcinogenesis is a multistep process. involving both genetic and epigenetic modification process of genes. involved in diverse pathways ranging from DNA repair to metabolic processes. This study was undertaken to assess the role of promoter methylation of GSTP1 gene. a member of glutathione-S-transferase family of enzymes. in relation to its expression. polymorphism. and clinicopathological parameters. Tissue samples were taken from breast cancer patients and paired with their normal adjacent tissues. A total of 51 subjects were studied. in which the frequency of promoter methylation in cancerous tissue was 37.25% as against 11% in the normal tissues (p = 0.001). The hypermethylated status of the gene was significantly associated with the loss of the protein expression (r = -0.449. p = 0.001. odds ratio = 7.42. 95% confidence interval = 2.05-26.92). Furthermore. when compared with the clinical parameters. the significant association was found between the promoter hypermethylation and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.001). tumor stage (p = 0.039). tumor grade (p = 0.028). estrogen receptor status (p = 0.018). and progesterone receptor status (p = 0.046). Our study is the first of its kind in Kashmiri population. which indicates that GSTP1 shows aberrant methylation pattern in the breast cancer with the consequent loss in the protein expression. Furthermore. it also shows that the gene polymorphism (Ile105Val) at codon 105 is not related to the promoter methylation and two are the independent events in breast cancer development....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
81,Keratins are fibrous proteins. Hair keratins constitute hard structures such as the hair and nails. and cytokeratins have been used as markers of breast carcinoma. However. the expression and function of full-size hair keratin genes have not been previously demonstrated in breast cancer. We investigated the expression of the hair keratin. KRT81. and its function in human breast cancer and normal mammary epithelial cells. Western blotting showed full size 55-kDa KRT81 expression in the human breast cancer cell lines. MCF7. SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231. normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). and non-neoplastic cells (MCF10A). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the full size KRT81. including its 5' region is expressed in breast cells. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses showed that KRT81 was located in the cytoplasm. To investigate the function of KRT81. we knocked down KRT81 by siRNA in MCF10A cells. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression of genes related to invasion such as matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)9 was decreased. In KRT81-knockdown MDA-MB231 cells. zymography revealed a decrease in MMP9 activity. while scratch and invasion assays revealed that KRT81-knockdown decreased cell migration and invasion abilities. This is the first study showing that full size KRT81 is expressed in normal breast epithelial cells and breast cancer cells. Moreover. our results indicate that KRT81 contributes to the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
82,Breast cancer is a disease of unknown etiology; however. the major risk factors are genetic alterations. Studies have demonstrated an association between insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) gene polymorphism and cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. in addition to its role in breast cancer growth and aggressiveness. Two polymorphic variants of the IGF-1 gene are highlighted in association with breast cancer. rs6220 and rs7136446. although controversy exists as to this relationship. The current study included 137 women (68 breast cancer cases and 69 controls without breast cancer) who had 3 ml of peripheral blood drawn for the study of genomic DNA extracted from leukocytes using the genotyping technique by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The CC genotype (rs7136446) was present in 4 women (5.9%) from the case group and in 2 (3.0%) women from the control group (p = 0.67). while the GG genotype (rs6220) occurred in 8 (11.5%) women from the case group and in 5 (7.2%) women from the control group (p = 0.75). No statistically significant difference was observed between the CC genotype of variant rs7136446 in premenopausal case and control women (p = 0.31). thus as there was also no significant difference between case and control postmenopausal women (p = 1.00). Concerning the GG genotype of rs6220. it occurred in 6 (14.2%) premenopausal case and 4 (8%) control women (p = 0.71) and no difference was found in postmenopausal women (p = 1.00). In the current study. IGF-1 gene polymorphism of SNP variants rs6220 and rs7136446 had no statistically significant association with breast cancer. both in premenopausal and postmenopausal women....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
83,Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. Therapeutic treatments for breast cancer generally include surgery. chemotherapy. radiotherapy. endocrinotherapy and molecular targeted therapy. With the development of molecular biology. immunology and pharmacogenomics. immunotherapy becomes a promising new field in breast cancer therapies. In this review. we discussed recent progress in breast cancer immunotherapy. including cancer vaccines. bispecific antibodies. and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Several additional immunotherapy modalities in early stages of development are also highlighted. It is believed that these new immunotherapeutic strategies will ultimately change the current status of breast cancer therapies....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
84,Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women worldwide. Tumor immunology suggests relationships between the immune system. chronic inflammation. and cancer. The immune system may either prevent or promote carcinogenesis. Here. we evaluated molecular signaling pathways common in inflammation and cancer and detected the microRNAs which play pivotal roles in mediating these pathways. Using bioinformatics assays. signaling pathways common in inflammation and cancer. and microRNAs mediating these pathways were identified. MiR-590 was selected and cloned into the pLenti-III-eGFP vector and transfected into the breast cancer cell lines. The expression level of microRNA and the candidate genes was evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. and the apoptosis level in transfected cells was measured by Annexin V-7AAD assay. The cell migration was tested by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for MMP2/MMP9. The expression levels of miR-590 and the selected genes (i.e. JAK2. PI3K. MAPK1. and CREB) were measured 72 h after transfection. While miR-590 showed an over-expression. the genes were significantly down-regulated. A significant increase was observed in apoptosis level in both cell lines and MMP2/MMP9 was significantly decreased in MDA-MB-231 cells. MiR-590 was selected as a microRNA which triggers and down-regulates critical genes of signaling pathways similar in cancer and inflammation. Following the miR-590 treatment. JAK2. PI3K. MAPK1. and CREB were down-regulated and the apoptosis level was increased in breast cancer cell lines. Apparently. some microRNAs can be good candidates for novel treatments of cancer. Although miR-590 showed good results in this study. further studies are required to investigate the role of miR-590 in breast cancer therapy....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Cancer
85,Studies have demonstrated low expression of miR-145 associated with cell proliferation and migration in a wide variety of tumors. Here. we studied the expression of miR-145 in relation to the occurrence and development of breast cancer. Total RNA from breast cancer tissue and corresponding adjacent normal tissue was extracted and used to detect miR-145 expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We also transfected breast cancer cells with hsa-miR-145 mimics. hsa-miR-145 inhibitor. mimics negative control (mimics NC) or inhibitor negative control (inhibitor NC). Cell proliferation was analyzed by colony formation assays and methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays. Cell proliferation in breast cancer cells was decreased after overexpression of miR-145 and increased following miR-145 suppression. Cell migration and invasion were assessed using Transwell and wound healing assays. respectively. and were also decreased after overexpression of miR-145 and increased after miR-145 suppression in breast cancer cells. Finally. western blot assays showed that over expression of miR-145 inhibited expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). Collectively. these data suggest that miR-145 may inhibit TGF-beta 1 protein expression which may in turn contribute to tumor formation....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
86,We here report identification and characterization of Required for Cell Differentiation I homolog (RQCD1) as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer. Gene-expression profiling analysis of breast cancer cells. semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Northern blotting and Western blotting confirmed RQCD1 to be frequently up-regulated in breast cancer specimens and breast cancer cell lines. On the other hand. its expression was very weak or hardly detectable in normal human tissues except testis. indicating this molecule to be a novel cancer-testis antigen. Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with siRNA targeting RQCD1 drastically suppressed cell proliferation. Concordantly. introduction of exogenous RQCD1 into HEK293 cells significantly enhanced cell growth. implying RQCD1 to have an oncogenic activity. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and immunocytochemical staining revealed an interaction of RQCD1 protein with Grb10 interacting GYF protein I (GIGYF1) and 2 (GIGYF2) proteins. involved in regulation of Akt activation. in breast cancer cells. Interestingly. knockdown of either of RQCD1. GIGYF1 or GIGYF2 resulted in significant reduction of the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 in breast cancer cell lines. Our findings suggest that RQCD1 is a potential molecular target for treatment of breast cancer....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Cancer
87,Background: Elevation of fatty acid synthase (FAS) in human cancers is often associated with increased tumor aggression. The basic genetic mechanisms leading to increased enzyme content in cancer cells were investigated using cell lines derived from human metastatic breast carcinomas (T47D. Zr75 and SKBr3) and normal human breast epithelium (184A1). Materials and Methods: Western analysis. Northern blotting. [2-C-14]malonyl-CoA incorporation assays. nuclear run-off transcription assays. mRNA decay assays. and poly(A) tail assays were used to measure and compare transcription rates of the FAS gene among the four cell lines. Results: By Western analysis. FAS levels in T47D were 2.6 times lower than ZR75 and SK-Br3. but 6.7 times greater than non-neoplastic 184A1 cells. FAS mRNA levels and specific activity correlated with protein content. In contrast. relative rates of FAS gene transcription were significantly higher in non-neoplastic 184A1 cells than T47D. ZR75 and SKBr3. Stability of message was investigated to explain this discrepancy. The half-life of FAS mRNA in 184A1 cells was 5.6 h. or 4-5-fold less than ZR75 and SKBr3. Poly(A) tail assays showed that FAS mRNA species from 184A1 cells tended to be longer than those of breast cancer cell lines (500-1500 nt versus 500-800 nt. respectively). Conclusion: Breast cancer cell lines contained significantly more FAS enzyme. message and activity than nonneoplastic 184A1 cells. Yet. 184A1 cells exhibited higher rates of FAS gene activation. The discrepancy is explained by faster decay of FAS message in 184A1 cells. suggesting that stabilization of FAS mRNA plays a major role in overexpression of the protein in breast cancer. Increased stability could not be explained simply by degree of polyadenylation. Therefore. some other mechanism (s) must be responsible for conferring stability to FAS RNA species in breast cancer cells....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Genetics
88,Breast cancer (BC) is a disease with different clinical. histological and molecular characteristics. frequently presenting mutated tumour-suppressing genes and oncogenes. P53 is a known tumour suppressor that is often mutated in BC; several mutations in p53 inhibit its role as a transcriptional repressor of several oncogenes. Topoisomerase 2 alpha (TOP2 alpha) is a gene target of p53. and it is also a known target for anthracyclines. The aim of the present study. was to analyse the genetic alterations of p53 and TOP2 alpha genes and their levels of protein expression. as well as their association with survival in Mexican women with BC. A total of 102 biopsies were collected (tumour and adjacent tissues) from patients with BC. To identify point mutations and deletions in the p53 gene. the Sanger sequencing method was carried out. Deletions or amplifications for TOP2 alpha gene were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In addition. the expression of the TOP2 alpha and p53 proteins was evaluated by western blotting. Furthermore. p53 protein expression was analysed by proximity ligation assay (PLA)-qPCR. Only 28.5% of the patients were found to have triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); the average age at the time of diagnosis of these patients was 50 years. and Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) histological grade III (p=0.0089). No differences in point mutations or deletions in p53. and deletions or amplifications as well as protein expression level of TOP2 alpha were observed between patients with TNBC and non-TNBC patients. However. patients with TNBC showed p53 protein overexpression as determined by PLA-qPCR and western blotting (p<0.0001). Furthermore. we found an association between TOP2 alpha amplification and over expression of its protein in patients with TNBC (p<0.0001). Concerning p53. overexpression resulted in a lower survival in patients with BC....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
89,Women with breast cancer frequently report distressing symptoms during and after treatment that can significantly erode quality of life (QOL). Symptom burden among women with breast cancer is of complex etiology and is likely influenced by disease. treatment. and environmental factors as well as individual genetic differences. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationships between genetic polymorphisms within Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 1 (NTRK1). Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (NTRK2). and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and patient symptom burden of QOL. pain. fatigue. anxiety. depression. and sleep disturbance before. during. and after treatment for breast cancer in a subset of participants (N = 51) in a randomized clinical trial of a novel symptom-management modality for women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Patients were recruited at the time of initial breast cancer diagnosis and completed all survey measures at the time of recruitment. after the initiation of treatment (surgery and/or chemotherapy). and then following treatment conclusion. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed significant associations between NTRK2 and COMT single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype and symptom burden. Two COMT variants were associated with the specific symptoms of anxiety and QOL measures prior to the initiation of chemotherapy as well as pain interference and severity during and after treatment. Genotype at the NTRK2 SNP rs1212171 was associated with both sleep disturbance and fatigue. These findings. while exploratory. indicate that the genotypes of NTRK2 and COMT may contribute to relative risk for symptom burden during and shortly after the period of chemotherapy in women with early stage breast cancer....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Cancer
90,Breast cancer is the second most common cause of mortality in women; therefore. the identification of novel putative markers is required to improve its diagnosis and prognosis. Selenium is known to protect mammary epithelial cells from oxidative DNA damage. and to inhibit the initiation phase of carcinogenesis by stimulating DNA repair and apoptosis regulation. Consequently. the present study has focused attention on the selenoprotein family and their involvement in breast cancer. The present study performed a global analysis of the seleno-transcriptome expression in human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cell lines compared with healthy breast MCF-10A cells using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The present data revealed the presence of differently expressed genes in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells compared with MCF-10A cells: Four downregulated [glutathione peroxidase (GPX) 1. GPX4. GPX5 and GPX7] and three upregulated (deiodinase iodothyronine. type II. GPX2 and GPX3) genes. Additionally. interactomic investigation were performed by the present study to evaluate the association between the downregulated and upregulated genes. and to identify putative HUB nodes. which represent the centers of association between the genes that are capable of direct control over the gene networks. Network analysis revealed that all differentially regulated genes. with the exception of selenoprotein T. are implicated in the same network that presents three HUB nodes interconnected to the selenoprotein mRNAs. including TP53. estrogen receptor 1 and catenin-beta 1 (CTNNB1). Overall. these data demonstrated for the first time. a profile of seleno-mRNAs specific for human breast cells. indicating that these genes alter their expression on the basis of the ER-positivity or negativity of breast cancer cells....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
91,It has recently become apparent that it is possible to characterize productively recombined. T-cell receptor (TcR) gene segments in tumor exome files. which presumably include representations of the DNA of other cells in the microenvironment. Similar characterizations have been done for TcR recombinations in tumor specimen RNASeq files. While exome files have been used to characterize immunoglobulin gene segment recombinations for tumors closely related to B-cells. immunoglobulin recombinations have yet to be characterized for putative microenvironment cells for solid tumors. Here we report a novel scripted algorithm that detects productive and unproductive immunoglobulin recombinations in both B-cell related tumor exome files and in solid tumor exome files. with the most important result being the relatively high level B-cell infiltrate in breast cancer. This analysis has the potential of streamlining and dramatically augmenting the knowledge base regarding B-cell infiltrates into solid tumors; and leading to antibody reagents directed against tumor antigens and tissue resident. infectious pathogens....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Lymphoma
92,Purpose This study was conducted to investigate the role of four polymorphic variants of DNA methyltransferase genes as risk factors for radiation-induced fibrosis in breast cancer patients. We also assessed their ability to improve prediction accuracy when combined with mitochondrial haplogroup H. which we previously found to be independently associated with a lower hazard of radiation-induced fibrosis. Materials and Methods DNMT1 rs2228611. DNMT3A rs1550117. DNMT3A rs7581217. and DNMT3B rs2424908 were genotyped by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 286 Italian breast cancer patients who received radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery. Subcutaneous fibrosis was scored according to the Late Effects of Normal Tissue-Subjective Objective Management Analytical (LENT-SOMA) scale. The discriminative accuracy of genetic models was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). Results Kaplan-Meier curves showed significant differences among DNMT1 rs2228611 genotypes in the cumulative incidence of grade 2 subcutaneous fibrosis (log-rank test p-value= 0.018). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed DNMT1 rs2228611 as an independent protective factor for moderate to severe radiation -induced fibrosis (GG vs. M; hazard ratio. 0.26; 95% confidence interval [Cl]. 0.10 to 0.71; p=0.009). Adding DNMT1 rs2228611to haplogroup H increased the discrimination accuracy (AUC) of the model from 0.595 (95% Cl. 0.536 to 0.653) to 0.655 (95% CI. 0.597 to 0.710). Conclusion DNMT1 rs2228611 may represent a determinant of radiation-induced fibrosis in breast cancer patients with promise for clinical usefulness in genetic-based predictive models....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
93,Aim: Aim of the present study is to evaluate the risk of residual neoplastic foci. in patients treated with breast conservative surgery. based on duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS) grading. Materials and methods: The study is based on a retrospective analysis of 419 resection specimens relative to 161 patients. All these patients underwent surgical re-excision when the first specimen had shown one or more margins involved by DCIS. Margins were oriented and the side of margin involved was recorded. Clonal analysis. using the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) technique. was obtained in selected cases. Results: Residual neoplastic foci were found in 145 out of 419 (34.6%) re-excised specimens. Specifically. residual foci of DCIS grade 2 and 3 were found more frequently in the margin facing the nipple (33.3% and 51.6%. respectively). On the contrary foci of DCIS grade 1 did not show any specific distribution. Clonal mt DNA analysis evidenced that DCIS grade 3 foci present in the re-excision specimens were genetically similar to the tumor removed in the first specimen. while DCIS grade 1 foci were not clonally related each other. Conclusions: The present data further confirm that DCIS grade 3 is characterized by a circumscribed neoplastic process extending along the large ducts probably of a single mammary lobe. On the contrary DCIS grade 1 is characterized by multiple independent neoplastic foci.. dispersed through several lobes indicating a field where multiple independent foci of cancer harbor.

94,The sialidase gene from Brevibacterium casei was cloned in pET28a and overexpressed as a histidine-tagged protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The histidine-tagged sialidase protein was purified and characterized from the crude cell extracts of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside-induced cells using Ni-NTA agarose chromatography. SDS-PAGE using the purified sialidase indicated a single band at 116 kDa. This sialidase showed maximum activity at a pH of 5.5 and temperature of 37 degrees C. The kinetic parameters K-m and V-max for the artificial substrate 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid sodium salt hydrate were 1.69 x 10(-3) mM and 244 mmol.Min(-1)center dot mg(-1). respectively. The sialidase may catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acids linked by the alpha-(2.3) and alpha-(2.8) linkage of polysialogangliosides. but it does not act on monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1). which offers it a great potential for commercially producing GM1 from polysialogangliosides.

95,This paper presents a scheme to improve the line current distortion of power factor corrector (PFC) topology at the zero crossing point using a predictive control algorithm in both the continuous conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). The line current in single-phase PFC topology is distorted at the zero crossing point of the input AC voltage because of the characteristic of the general proportional integral (PI) current controller. This distortion degrades the line current quality. such as the total harmonic distortion (THD) and the power factor (PF). Given the optimal duty cycle calculated by estimating the next state current in both the CCM and DCM. the proposed predictive control algorithm has a fast dynamic response and accuracy unlike the conventional PI current control method. These advantages of the proposed algorithm lower the line current distortion of PFC topology. The proposed method is verified through PSIM simulations and experimental results with 1.5 kW bridgeless PFC (BLPFC) topology....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Single-phase electric power
96,The present paper summarizes the results of some numerical calculations carried out on the basis of a recent wide experimental research. The calculations are performed on axisymmetric specimens weakened by V notches consisting of a large bulk of different shapes. The specimens are subjected to multiaxial fracture loading (tension + torsion). Stress and strain fields in the whole specimens are evaluated herein by using the finite element method (FEM). Special attention is paid to the changing distribution of stresses induced by loading and notch shape. By taking advantage of the numerical calculations carried out in the present investigation. a new non-local fracture criterion for notched specimens under multiaxial loading is proposed and successfully employed and compared with some data taken from the recent literature.

97,AimsThe aim of this study was to investigate potential molecular mechanisms associated with loss of BRM expression in poorly differentiated clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Methods and resultsNineteen previously selected BRM-negative RCC tissues were examined by DNA sequencing. fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the BRM gene. BRM mutation was identified in 78.9% (15 of 19) cases. chromosome 9 monosomy or BRM deletion in 43.8% (seven of 16) and BRM promoter region cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) methylation in 42.8% (six of 14). These results indicated that 89.5% (17 of 19) of the cases harboured at least one type of BRM genetic alteration. with two or more types of alteration in 47.4% (nine of 19). Such alterations were found rarely in adjacent non-neoplastic tissues and low-grade areas of composite tumours. ConclusionsBRM gene mutation. chromosome 9 monosomy or BRM deletion and CpG methylation contribute collectively to the loss of BRM expression in ccRCC. This work focusing on composite tumours indicated that BRM abnormality occurred during tumour progression....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
98,Multifunction RF systems which can operate with different RF functions like radar. communication and electronic warfare offer a variety of benefits beyond the well-known AESA (Active Electronically Steerable Antenna) features. To reach a sufficient technology maturity to start product development a series of challenges most stemming from the large required operation bandwidth have to be resolved. Dual-polarised low-loss apertures with array grids designed for a grating lobe and scan blindness free 60 conical Field of View (FoV) at the highest operational frequency have to be considered. The active components of the AESA and especially the T/R-M are required to be power efficient over the whole multifunction bandwidth and they shall be miniaturised to fit the array grid. RF functions like high speed datalink require linear high power amplification with low harmonics generation and interference suppression in receive is essential in order to maintain performance. Enablers for such broadband AESA are the GaN technology for T/R-M front-end components and SiCe BiCMOS technology for core chip and digital control of the T/R-M. The paper shows the state-of-the-art technology in Europe for multifunction RF Systems....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Satellite radio
