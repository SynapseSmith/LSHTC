0,Phytoplasmas are insect-vectored bacteria that cause disease in a wide range of plant species. The increasing availability of molecular DNA analyses. expertise and additional methods in recent years has led to a proliferation of discoveries of phytoplasma-plant host associations and in the numbers of taxonomic groupings for phytoplasmas. The widespread use of common names based on the diseases with which they are associated. as well as separate phenetic and taxonomic systems for classifying phytoplasmas based on variation at the 16S rRNA-encoding gene. complicates interpretation of the literature. We explore this issue and related trends through a focus on Australian pathosystems. providing the first comprehensive compilation of information for this continent. covering the phytoplasmas. host plants. vectors and diseases. Of the 33 16Sr groups reported internationally. only groups I. II. III. X. XI and XII have been recorded in Australia and this highlights the need for ongoing biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction of additional pathogen groups. Many of the phytoplasmas reported in Australia have not been sufficiently well studied to assign them to 16Sr groups so it is likely that unrecognized groups and sub-groups are present. Wide host plant ranges are apparent among well studied phytoplasmas. with multiple crop and non-crop species infected by some. Disease management is further complicated by the fact that putative vectors have been identified for few phytoplasmas. especially in Australia. Despite rapid progress in recent years using molecular approaches. phytoplasmas remain the least well studied group of plant pathogens. making them a "crouching tiger" disease threat....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Polymerase chain reaction
0,Background: (-)-alpha-Bisabolol. also known as levomenol. is an unsaturated sesquiterpene alcohol that has mainly been used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products due to its anti-inflammatory and skin-soothing properties. (-)-alpha-Bisabolol is currently manufactured mainly by steam-distillation of the essential oils extracted from the Brazilian candeia tree that is under threat because its natural habitat is constantly shrinking. Therefore. microbial production of (-)-alpha-bisabolol plays a key role in the development of its sustainable production from renewable feedstock. Results: Here. we created an Escherichia coli strain producing (-)-alpha-bisabolol at high titer and developed an in situ extraction method of (-)-alpha-bisabolol. using natural vegetable oils. We expressed a recently identified (-)-alpha-bisabolol synthase isolated from German chamomile (Matricaria recutita) (titer: 3 mg/L). converted the acetyl-CoA to mevalonate. using the biosynthetic mevalonate pathway (12.8 mg/L). and overexpressed farnesyl diphosphate synthase to efficiently supply the (-)-alpha-bisabolol precursor farnesyl diphosphate. Combinatorial expression of the exogenous mevalonate pathway and farnesyl diphosphate synthase enabled a dramatic increase in (-)-alpha-bisabolol production in the shake flask culture (80 mg/L) and 5 L bioreactor culture (342 mg/L) of engineered E. coli harboring (-)-alpha-bisabolol synthase. Fed-batch fermentation using a 50 L fermenter was conducted after optimizing culture conditions. resulting in efficient (-)-alpha-bisabolol production with a titer of 9.1 g/L. Moreover. a green. downstream extraction process using vegetable oils was developed for in situ extraction of (-)-alpha-bisabolol during fermentation and showed high yield recovery (>98%). Conclusions: The engineered E. coli strains and economically viable extraction process developed in this study will serve as promising platforms for further development of microbial production of (-)-alpha-bisabolol at large scale....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Enzymology
1,A universal feature of the replication of positive-strand RNA viruses is the association with intracellular membranes. Carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) replication in plants occurs in vesicles derived from the mitochondrial outer membrane. The product encoded by CIRV ORF1. p36. is required for targeting the virus replication complex to the outer mitochondrial membrane both in plant and yeast cells. Here the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a model host to study the effect of CIRV p36 on cell survival and death. It was shown that p36 does not promote cell death. but decreases cell growth rate. In addition. p36 changed the nature of acetic acid-induced cell death in yeast by increasing the number of cells dying by necrosis with concomitant decrease of the number of cells dying by programmed cell death. as judged by measurements of phosphatidylserine externalization. The tight association of p36 to membranes was not affected by acetic acid treatment. thus confirming the peculiar and independent interaction of CIRV p36 with mitochondria in yeast. This work proved yeast as an invaluable model organism to study both the mitochondrial determinants of the type of cell death in response to stress and the molecular pathogenesis of (+)RNA viruses.

2,1.2-Dichloropropane (1.2-DCP) and dichloromethane (DCM) are possible causative agents associated with the development of cholangiocarcinoma in employees working in printing plant in Osaka. Japan. However. few reports have demonstrated an association between these agents and cholangiocarcinoma in rodent carcinogenicity studies. Moreover. the combined effects of these compounds have not been fully elucidated. In the present study. we evaluated the in vivo mutagenicity of 1.2-DCP and DCM. alone or combined. in the livers of gpt delta rats. Six-week-old male F344 gpt delta rats were treated with 1.2-DCP. DCM or 1.2-DCP+DCM by oral administration for 4weeks at the dose (200mgkg(-1) body weight 1.2-DCP and 500mgkg(-1) body weight DCM) used in the carcinogenesis study performed by the National Toxicology Program. In vivo mutagenicity was analyzed by gpt mutation/Spi(-) assays in the livers of rats. In addition. gene and protein expression of CYP2E1 and GSTT1. the major enzymes responsible for the genotoxic effects of 1.2-DCP and DCM. were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Gpt and Spi(-) mutation frequencies were not increased by 1.2-DCP and/or DCM in any group. Additionally. there were no significant changes in the gene and protein expression of CYP2E1 and GSTT1 in any group. These results indicated that 1.2-DCP. DCM and 1.2-DCP+DCM had no significant impact on mutagenicity in the livers of gpt delta rats under our experimental conditions. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons.

3,This paper presents the simulation results of a linear. fully integrated. two-stage digitally programmable 130 nm CMOS power amplifier (PA) operating at 2.4 GHz. Its power stage is composed of a set of amplifying cells which can be enabled or disabled independently by a digital control circuit. All seven operational modes are univocal in terms of 1 dB output compression point (OCP1dB). saturated output power (P-SAT) and power gain at 2.4 GHz. The lowest power mode achieves an 8.1 dBm P-SAT. a 13.5 dB power gain and consumes 171 mW DC power (P-DC) at an OCP1dB of 6 dBm. whereas the highest power mode reaches an 18.9 dBm P-SAT and a 21.1 dB power gain and consumes 415 mW P-DC at an OCP1dB of 18.2 dBm....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
4,The glycogen branching enzyme (EC 2.4.1.18). which catalyses the formation of alpha-1.6-glycosidic branch points in glycogen structure. is often used to enhance the nutritional value and quality of food and beverages. In order to be applicable in industries. enzymes that are stable and active at high temperature are much desired. Using genome mining. the nucleotide sequence of the branching enzyme gene (glgB) was extracted from the Geobacillus mahadia Geo-05 genome sequence provided by the Malaysia Genome Institute. The size of the gene is 2013 bp. and the theoretical molecular weight of the protein is 78.43 kDa. The gene sequence was then used to predict the thermostability. function and the three dimensional structure of the enzyme. The gene was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli to verify the predicted result experimentally. The purified enzyme was used to study the effect of temperature and pH on enzyme activity and stability. and the inhibitory effect by metal ion on enzyme activity. This thermostable glycogen branching enzyme was found to be most active at 55 degrees C. and the half-life at 60 degrees C and 70 degrees C was 24 h and 5 h. respectively. From this research. a thermostable glycogen branching enzyme was successfully isolated from Geobacillus mahadia Geo-05 by genome mining together with molecular biology technique....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Enzymology
5,The microbial populations in the activated sludge of two Polish wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were identified and quantified using Illumina sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA amplicons over a 2-year period. Their dynamics over time were compared to Danish WWTPs (data collected in previous studies by Center for Microbial Communities. Aalborg University). The bacterial communities in Polish and Danish WWTPs were similar to each other. but the microbial diversity in Polish WWTPs was lower. The dominant genera in Polish WWTPs were more abundant than in Danish WWTPs; 30 of them constituted more than half the of activated sludge community. Polish WWTPs showed a higher abundance of bacteria involved in nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand removal (Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes). while polyphosphate-acculumating bacteria were the dominant bacterial group in Danish plants. The microbial community structures in the examined Polish WWTPs were relatively similar to each other and showed strong seasonal variations which are not normally observed in Danish WWTPs....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,DNA/RNA sequencing
6,Background: Broad-range 16S rRNA PCR can be used for the detection and identification of bacteria from clinical specimens in patients for whom there is a high suspicion of infection and cultures are negative. The aims of this study were (1) to compare 16S rRNA PCR results with microbiolog ical culture results. (2) to assess the utility of 16S rRNA PCR with regard to antimicrobial therapy. and (3) to compare the yield of 16S rRNA PCR for different types of clinical specimen and to perform a cost analysis of the test. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on different clinical specimens which had 16S performed over 3 years (2012-2015). Standard microbiological cultures were performed on appropriate media. as per the laboratory protocol. Patient clinical and microbiological data were obtained from the electronic medical records and laboratory information system. respectively. 16S rRNA PCR was performed in a reference laboratory using a validated method for amplification and sequencing. The outcomes assessed were the performance of 16S rRNA PCR. change of antimicrobials (rationalization. cessation. or addition). and duration of therapy. Concordance of 16S rRNA PCR with bacterial cultures was also determined for tissue specimens. Results: Thirty-two patients were included in the study. for whom an equal number of specimens (n = 32) were sent for 16S rRNA PCR. 16S rRNA PCR could identify an organism in 10 of 32 cases (31.2%). of which seven were culture-positive and three were culture-negative. The sensitivity was 58% (confidence interval (CI) 28.59-83.5%) and specificity was 85% (CI 61.13-96%). with a positive predictive value of 70% (CI 35.3-91.9%) and negative predictive value of 77.2% (CI 54.17-91.3%). Antimicrobial therapy was rationalized after 16S rRNA PCR results in five patients (15.6%) and was ceased in four based on negative results (12.5%). Overall the 16S rRNA PCR result had an impact on antimicrobial therapy in 28% of patients (9/32). The highest concordance of 16S rRNA PCR with bacterial culture was found for heart valve tissue (80%). followed by joint fluid/tissue (50%). Conclusions: Despite the low diagnostic yield. results of 16S rRNA PCR can still have a significant impact on patient management due to rationalization or cessation of the antimicrobial therapy. The yield of 16S rRNA PCR was highest for heart valves. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

7,Brinjal little leaf (BLL) is a widespread disease of phytoplasma etiology in India that induces severe economic losses. Surveys were conducted in eight brinjalgrowing states of India during July 2014 to September 2015 and eighteen BLL samples showing little leaf. phyllody and witches' broom symptoms were collected for phytoplasma identification. Presence of phytoplasmas was confirmed in all the eighteen BLL samples using polymerase chain reaction with phytoplasma-specific primer pairs (P1/P6. R16F2n/R16R2). Pair wise sequence comparison and phylogenetic relationship of 16S rRNA gene sequences of BLL phytoplasma strains confirmed that sixteen out of eighteen BLL strains belonged to clover proliferation phytoplasma (16SrVI) group and two BLL strains (GKP-A and GKP-B) from Gorakhpur. Uttar Pradesh. were classified under 16SrII group. Further virtual RFLP analysis of 16S rDNA sequences allowed finer classification of BLL strains into 16SrII-D and 16SrVI-D subgroups. BLL phytoplasma strains belonging to 16SrVI-D subgroup were found as the most widespread phytoplasma strains associated with BLL disease in India. 16SrVI-D subgroup phytoplasma association with two symptomatic weed species viz. Cannabis sativa subsp. sativa at Noida. Uttar Pradesh and Portulaca oleracea at IARI fields. New Delhi was also confirmed by nested PCR assays with similar set of phytoplasma-specific primers. pairwise 16S rDNA sequence comparison. phylogeny and virtual RFLP analysis. Out of five identified leafhopper species from BLL-infected fields at Noida. Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. only Hishimonas phycitis was identified as carrier and natural vector of 16SrVI-D subgroup of phytoplasmas by nested PCR assays. sequence comparison. phylogeny. virtual RFLP analysis and transmission assays....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Polymerase chain reaction
8,Surveys for the Cote d'Ivoire lethal yellowing (CILY) phytoplasma were conducted in eight severely CILY-affected villages of Grand-Lahou in 2015. Leaves. inflorescences and trunk borings were collected from coconut palms showing CILY symptoms and from symptomless trees. Total DNA was extracted from these samples and tested by nested polymerase chain reaction/RFLP and sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA. ribosomal protein (rp) and the translocation protein (secA) genes. The CILY phytoplasma was detected in 82.9% of the symptom-bearing palms collected from all the surveyed villages and from all the plant parts. Trunk borings were recommended as the most suitable plant tissue type for sampling. Results indicate that the CILY phytoplasma may have a westward spread to other coconut-growing areas of Grand-Lahou. CILY phytoplasma strains infecting coconut palms in the western region of Grand-Lahou exhibited unique single nucleotide polymorphisms on the rp sequence compared to the strains from the eastern region. Moreover. single nucleotide polymorphisms on the SecA sequence distinguished the CILY phytoplasma from the Cape St. Paul Wilt Disease phytoplasma in Ghana. and the Lethal Yellowing phytoplasma in Mozambique....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Polymerase chain reaction
9,Advances in sequencing technologies continue to provide unprecedented opportunities to characterize microbial communities. For example. the Pacific Biosciences Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) platform has emerged as a unique approach harnessing DNA polymerase activity to sequence template molecules. enabling long reads at low costs. With the aim to simultaneously classify and enumerate in situ microbial populations. we developed a quantitative SMRT (qSMRT) approach that involves the addition of exogenous standards to quantify ribosomal amplicons derived from environmental samples. The V7-9 regions of 18S SSU rDNA were targeted and quantified from protistan community samples collected in the Ross Sea during the Austral summer of 2011. We used three standards of different length and optimized conditions to obtain accurate quantitative retrieval across the range of expected amplicon sizes. a necessary criterion for analyzing taxonomically diverse 18S rDNA molecules from natural environments. The ability to concurrently identify and quantify microorganisms in their natural environment makes qSMRT a powerful. rapid and cost-effective approach for defining ecosystem diversity and function.

10,1A6/DRIM is a nucleolar protein with a nucleolar targeting sequence in its 3'-terminus. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that human 1A6/ DRIM shares 23% identity and 43% similarity with yeast Utp20. which has been reported as a component of U3 snoRNA protein complex and has been implicated in 18S rRNA processing. In the present study. we found. by utilizing RT-PCR with RNA extracted from anti-1A6/DRIM inummoprecipitates and Northern blotting. that 1A6/DRIM is associated with U3 snoRNA. Pulse-chase labeling assays showed that silencing of 1A6/DRIM expression in HeLa cells resulted in a delayed 18S rRNA processing. Furthermore. immunoprecipitations revealed that 1A6/DRIM was also associated with fibrillarin. another U3 RNP component in HeLa cells. These results indicate that 1A6/DRIM is involved in 18S rRNA processing and is the bona fide mammalian Utp20. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

11,Aims: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a neurogenetic condition associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. Previous studies have shown that negative symptoms represent the most specific clinical characteristic of psychosis in 22q11.2DS and are strongly associated with outcome. However. the psychological mechanisms associated with these symptoms in this population are poorly understood. In accordance with recent conceptualizations in the field of schizophrenia. the present study aims at investigating whether negative symptoms are associated with the presence of negative performance beliefs and cognitive deficits. Methods: Thirty-five participants with 22q11.2DS and 24 typically developing individuals aged between 11 and 24 years were included in the study. Self-reported schizotypal symptoms (cognitive-perceptual. paranoid. negative and disorganization symptoms) and dysfunctional beliefs (negative performance beliefs and need for approval) were assessed. Measures of processing speed. verbal memory. working memory. executive functioning and face recognition-were also extracted from a broad cognitive evaluation protocol. Results: Adolescents with 22q11.2DS reported significantly higher score on the negative dimension of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire than controls. even when controlling for the influence of anxiety/depression and intellectual functioning. Negative and paranoid symptoms were associated with the severity of negative performance beliefs and lower face recognition abilities. Mediation analyses revealed that negative performance beliefs significantly mediated the association between face recognition and negative/paranoid symptoms. Conclusions: These findings suggest that negative performance beliefs and basic social cognitive mechanisms are associated with negative and paranoid symptoms in individuals with 22q11.2DS. Implications for intervention are discussed in this article....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
12,Background: Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a neurogenetic disorder that is associated with a 25-fold increase in schizophrenia. Both individuals with 22q11.2DS and those with schizophrenia present with social cognitive deficits. which are putatively subserved by a network of brain regions that are involved in the processing of social cognitive information. This study used two-tensor tractography to examine the white matter tracts believed to underlie the social brain network in a group of 57 young adults with 22q11.2DS compared to 30 unaffected controls. Results: Results indicated that relative to controls. participants with 22q11.2DS showed significant differences in several DTI metrics within the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. cingulum bundle. thalamo-frontal tract. and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. In addition. participants with 22q11.2DS showed significant differences in scores on measures of social cognition. including the Social Responsiveness Scale and Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. Further analyses among individuals with 22q11.2DS demonstrated an association between DTI metrics and positive and negative symptoms of psychosis. as well as differentiation between individuals with 22q11.2DS and overt psychosis. relative to those with positive prodromal symptoms or no psychosis. Conclusions: Findings suggest that white matter disruption. specifically disrupted axonal coherence in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. may be a biomarker for social cognitive difficulties and psychosis in individuals with 22q11.2DS....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Schizophrenia
13,Through the comprehensive analysis of the genomic DNA sequence of human chromosome 22. we identified a novel gene of 702 kb encoding a big protein of 2481 amino acid residues. and named it as TPRBK (TPR containing big gene cloned at Keio). A novel protein TPRBK possesses 25 units of the TPR motif. which has been known to associate with a diverse range of biological functions. Orthologous genes of human TPRBK were found widely in animal species. from insecta to mammal. but not found in plants. fungi and nematoda. Northern blotting and RT-PCR analyses revealed that TPRBK gene is expressed ubiquitously in the human and mouse fetal tissues and various cell lines of human. monkey and mouse. lmmunofluorescent staining of the synchronized monkey COS-7 cells with several relevant antibodies indicated that TPRBK changes its subcellular localization during the cell cycle: at interphase TPRBK locates on the centrosomes. during mitosis it translocates from spindle poles to mitotic spindles then to spindle midzone. and through a period of cytokinesis it stays on the midbody. Co-immunoprecipitation assay and immunofluorescent staining with adequate antibodies revealed that TPRBK binds to Aurora B. and those proteins together translocate throughout mitosis and cytokinesis. Treatments of cells with two drugs (Blebbistatin and Y-27632). that are known to inhibit the contractility of actin-myosin. disturbed the proper intracellular localization of TPRBK. Moreover. the knockdown of TPRBK expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed the bundling of spindle midzone microtubules and disrupted the midbody formation. arresting the cells at G(2) + M phase. These observations indicated that a novel big protein TPRBK is essential for the formation and integrity of the midbody. hence we postulated that TPRBK plays a critical role in the progress of mitosis and cytokinesis during mammalian cell cycle.

14,Graphene and other two-dimensional materials have received considerable attention regarding their potential applications in nano-electronics. Here. we report top-gate nonvolatile memory field-effect transistors (FETs) with different layers of MoSe2 nanosheets channel gated by ferroelectric film. The conventional gate dielectric of FETs was replaced by a ferroelectric thin film that provides a ferroelectric polarization electric field. and therefore defined as an Fe-FET where the poly (vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) was used as the gate dielectric. Among the devices with MoSe2 channels of different thicknesses. the device with a single layer of MoSe2 exhibited a large hysteresis of electronic transport with an over 10(5) write/erase ratio. and displayed excellent retention and endurance performance. The possible mechanism of the device's good properties was qualitatively analyzed using band theory. Additionally. a comprehensive study comparing the memory properties of MoSe2 channels of different thicknesses is presented. Increasing the numbers of MoSe2 layers was found to cause a reduced memory window. However. MoSe2 thickness of 5 nm yielded a write/erase ratio of more than 10(3). The results indicate that. based on a Fe-FET structure. the combination of two-dimensional semiconductors and organic ferroelectric gate dielectrics shows good promise for future applications in nonvolatile ferroelectric memory....,Psychology,ECE,Attention,Electricity
15,Relationships between the abundance of potential geosmin- and 2-methylisoborneol-producing (2-MIB) cyanobacteria and bacteria. and concentrations of the two taste and odour compounds (T&Os) were examined in a 7 day incubation of natural water from the surface and bottom of three reservoirs in southeast Queensland. Australia. Only a single known T&O-producing cyanobacterium (Geitlerinema spp.) was detected by microscopy at low density. and only in one reservoir. Densities of potential T&O-producing Streptomyces (determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay) were highest in the bottom water and varied from 0.7 x 10(3) to 775 x 10(3) cells L-1. Geosmin ranged from 6 to 59 ng L-1 (with the highest concentrations in the bottom water). while 2-MIB varied from 6 to 47 ng L-1 (with the highest concentration in surface water). Concentrations of both compounds declined during the incubation under both light and dark conditions. Presence of the geosmin synthase gene. geoA. in cyanobacteria and Streptomyces was examined by different PCR approaches. Cloning of PCR products from amplification of geoA showed a high similarity to geoA in cyanobacteria. but not to streptomycetes. Our results demonstrate that more research on the ecology and molecular biology of T&O producers is required to better understand the dynamics of T&Os and to monitor emerging T&O episodes....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Molecular biology
16,We have carried out animal toxicity tests of chemicals for a chemical safety program implemented by the Ministry of Economy. Trade. and Industry of Japan. Here. we tested 1-tert-butoxy-4-chlorobenzene in a combined repeat-dose and developmental and reproductive toxicity test. The test chemical was administered daily by gavage to 9-week-old Crl:CD (SD) rats at doses of 0. 20. 100. and 500 mg/kg/d. Males were treated for 42 d beginning 14 d before mating. Females were treated from 14 d before mating to day 4 of lactation. Decreased spontaneous locomotion. decreased respiratory rate. and incomplete eyelid opening were observed at 500 mg/kg/d (both sexes). but resolved within 30 min of administration. suggesting central nervous system depression. No notable changes were observed in body weight. food consumption. functional battery tests. or blood test. Increased liver weight with centrilobular or diffuse hepatocyte hypertrophy was observed at 100 and 500 mg/kg/d (both sexes). There were no biochemical or histopathological changes related to hepatotoxicity. Increased kidney weight with basophilic tubules. tubule dilatation. and increased hyaline droplets were observed in males dosed at 100 and 500 mg/kg/d. Immunohistochemical staining indicated alpha(2u)-globulin nephropathy. a male rat-specific toxicity. Although kidney weight was also increased in females dosed at 500 mg/kg/d. it was not considered to be an adverse effect because there were no histopathological changes. Pup weights on postnatal day 0 were decreased at 500 mg/kg/d and still decreased on postnatal day 4. Our data indicated the no-observed-adverse-effect-level for repeated-dose and reproductive/developmental toxicity for 1-tert-butoxy-4-chlorobenzene was 100 mg/kg/d....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Atopic Dermatitis
17,The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) plays a mandatory role in the action of most opioid drugs. such as morphine. fentanyl. and heroin. it has been revealed that a deficiency in the MOR gene (Oprm 1) or a difference in the 3' noncoding region of the gene markedly affects the sensitivity of mice to opioids. As the 3' noncoding region of the human OPRM1 gene had not yet been characterized. in the present study we conducted 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3'RACE)-PCR and identified the 3' end of the human MOR-1 mRNA. the most abundant transcript among OPRM1 gene transcripts. The poly(A) signal was located at 13612-13617 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon in the OPRM1 gene. Reverse transcription PCR analyses showed that the region from the stop codon to the poly(A) signal was transcribed. In the 3' UTR. we identified 33 AU-rich regions and more than 300 putative transcription factor-binding sites. Furthermore. we compared the 3' noncoding regions of the human and mouse OPRM1/Oprm1] genes and found apparent homology. In Northern blotting with mouse brain mRNAs. a same-size band was detected by a probe for the MOR-1 coding region and by a probe for a mouse genome region corresponding to the human MOR-1 3'UTR. Since 3'UTRs affect gene expression. the present characterization of the 3' noncoding region in the human OPRM1 gene should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying OPRM1 gene regulation and individual differences in sensitivity to opioids.

19,3D printing has shown promise for neural regeneration by providing customized nerve scaffolds to structurally support and bridge the defect gap as well as deliver cells or various bioactive substances. Low-level light therapy (LLLT) exhibits positive effects on rehabiliation of degenerative nerves and neural disorders. With this in mind. we postulate that 3D printed neural scaffold coupling with LLLT will generate a new strategy to repair neural degeneration. To achieve this goal. we applied red laser light to stimualte neural stem cells on 3D printed scaffolds and investigated the subsequent cell response with respect to cell proliferation and differentiation. Here we show that cell prolifeartion rate and intracellular reactive oxgen species synthesis were significantly increased after 15 s laser stimulation follwed by 1 d culture. Over culturing time of 14 d in vitro. the laser stimulation promoted neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells. while the glial differentiation was suppressed based on results of both immunocytochemistry studies and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. These findings suggest that integration of 3D printing and LLLT might provide a powerful methodology for neural tissue engineering....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Multiple Sclerosis
20,With the advances of stem cell research. development of intelligent biomaterials and three-dimensional biofabrication strategies. highly mimicked tissue or organs can be engineered. Among all the biofabrication approaches. bioprinting based on inkjet printing technology has the promises to deliver and create biomimicked tissue with high throughput. digital control. and the capacity of single cell manipulation. Therefore. this enabling technology has great potential in regenerative medicine and translational applications. The most current advances in organ and tissue bioprinting based on the thermal inkjet printing technology are described in this review. including vasculature. muscle. cartilage. and bone. In addition. the benign side effect of bioprinting to the printed mammalian cells can be utilized for gene or drug delivery. which can be achieved conveniently during precise cell placement for tissue construction. With layer-by-layer assembly. three-dimensional tissues with complex structures can be printed using converted medical images. Therefore. bioprinting based on thermal inkjet is so far the most optimal solution to engineer vascular system to the thick and complex tissues. Collectively. bioprinting has great potential and broad applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The future advances of bioprinting include the integration of different printing mechanisms to engineer biphasic or triphasic tissues with optimized scaffolds and further understanding of stem cell biology....,ECE,biochemistry,Digital control,Cell biology
21,3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) was a novel hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-synthesizing enzyme that may be involved in cyanide degradation and in thiosulfate biosynthesis. Over recent years. considerable attention has been focused on the biochemistry and molecular biology of H2S-synthesizing enzyme. In contrast. there have been few concerted attempts to investigate the changes in the expression of the H2S-synthesizing enzymes with disease states. To investigate the changes of 3-MST after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its possible role. mice TBI model was established by controlled cortical impact system. and the expression and cellular localization of 3-MST after TBI was investigated in the present study. Western blot analysis revealed that 3-MST was present in normal mice brain cortex. It gradually increased. reached a peak on the first day after TBI. and then reached a valley on the third day. Importantly. 3-MST was colocalized with neuron. In addition. Western blot detection showed that the first day post injury was also the autophagic peak indicated by the elevated expression of LC3. Importantly. immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that injury-induced expression of 3-MST was partly colabeled by LC3. However. there was no colocalization of 3-MST with propidium iodide (cell death marker) and LC3 positive cells were partly colocalized with propidium iodide. These data suggested that 3-MST was mainly located in living neurons and may be implicated in the autophagy of neuron and involved in the pathophysiology of brain after TBI....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Enzymology
22,Oxidative stress is closely involved in neurodegenerative diseases. The present study aimed to examine the effect of anti-oxidant DHM (dihydromyricetin) on 3NP (3-nitropropionic acid) -induced behavioral deficits of experimental rats and striatal histopathological injury by using behavioral. imaging. biochemistry. histochemistry and molecular biology technologies. The experimental results showed that both motor dysfunctions and learning and memory impairments induced by 3NP were significantly reduced after DHM treatment. 3NP-induced striatal metabolic abnormality was also remarkably improved by DHM treatment. showed as the increased glucose metabolism in PET/CT scan. decreased MDA (malondialdehyde) and increased SOD (superoxide dismutase) activity in enzyme histochemical staining. In addition. the cell apoptosis was evidently detected in the striatum of the 3NP group. while in the 3NP + DHM group. the number of apoptotic cells was remarkably reduced. 3NP treatment obviously induced down-regulation of Bcl-2. and up-regulations of Bax and Cleaved Caspase-3. while these changes were significantly reversed by DHM treatment. The present results suggested that DHM showed its protective effect by anti-oxidant and anti-apoptosis mechanisms....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Parkinson's Disease
23,The 45 degrees beam splitting mirror plays a vital role on image quality in the Holographic system. in order to study the influence of environment temperature variation on the 45 degrees beam splitting mirror in the Holographic system. finite element analysis method is used to simulate the anti-three through seven mirror deformation at 27 degrees C. 28 degrees C and 29 degrees C temperature in theory. A new real-time monitoring and displaying photoelectric system for ambient temperature and beam splitting mirror distortion detection is designed to provide real-time temperature change and deformation detection. which is made up of laser speckle interferometer. chip temperature sensor. two-operational amplifier. MCU and LED indicator. And the out-plane displacement value measured in the experiment under the condition of temperature correspondingly are 406nm. 420nm and 427 nm.

24,A thermotolerant bacterium Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus with an ability to produce extracellular -mannanase was isolated from a soil sample. Bacterium produced 45U/mL -mannanase at 50 degrees C. The culture conditions for high-level production of -mannanase were optimized. Optimized MS medium [wheat bran 2% (w/v). ammonium sulfate 0.3% (w/v). yeast extract. and peptone (0.025% each) pH 6.5] was inoculated with 2% of 16H old culture. The culture was incubated at 50 degrees C for 48H resulting in 24-folds higher -mannanase production (1.100 +/- 50U/mL). Optimum pH and temperature for enzyme activity of the crude enzyme was 6.0 and 60 degrees C. respectively. The enzyme demonstrated 65% relative enzyme activity at 37 degrees C. The hydrolytic activity of the crude enzymatic preparation was assessed on various agro residues. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis showed that the enzyme activity to saccharify heteromannans resulted in production of a mixture of manno-oligosaccharides (MOS) and enzyme exhibited classic endo-activity. To evaluate the possible prebiotic potential of the MOS thus obtained. initial screening for their ability to support the growth of probiotics was carried out by the pure culture method. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus sp. responded positively to the addition of enzymatically derived oligosaccharides and their numbers increased significantly.

25,Serotonin N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (SHT) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of feruloylserotonin (FS) and 4-coumaroylserotonin (CS). These serotonin derivatives show strong antioxidant activity. making them valuable for both nutritional and pharmacological use in humans. Ectopic expression of SHT under the control of the endosperm specific-glutelin and prolamin promoters from rice was produced via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. SHT expression was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. followed by Northern blotting and SHT enzyme activity analyses using total RNA and protein. respectively. extracted from transgenic seeds. The glutelin A3 (GluA3) promoter produced low SHT mRNA expression in rice seeds. whereas the prolamin promoter expressed high levels of SHT mRNA. In spite of the ectopic expression of SHT in rice seeds. both transgenic genotypes accumulated levels of serotonin derivatives similar to those found in wild-type rice. Furthermore. our data suggest that serotonin. rather than phenylpropanid-CoAs. is the rate-limiting substrate in the biosynthesis of serotonin derivatives in SHT-overexpressing transgenic rice seeds....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Enzymology
26,A compact. low-noise and inexpensive preamplifier circuit has been designed and fabricated to optimally readout a common cathode (1 x 16) channel 4H-SiC Schottky photodiode array for use in ultraviolet experiments. The readout uses an operational amplifier with 10 pF capacitor in the feedback loop in parallel with a low leakage switch for each of the channels. This circuit configuration allows for reiterative sample. integrate and reset. A sampling technique is given to remove Johnson noise. enabling a femtoampere level readout noise performance. Commercial-off-the-shelf acquisition electronics are used to digitize the preamplifier analog signals. The data logging acquisition electronics has a different integration circuit. which allows the bandwidth and gain to be independently adjusted. Using this readout. photoresponse measurements across the array between spectral wavelengths 200 nm and 370 nm are made to establish the array pixels external quantum efficiency. current responsivity and noise equivalent power.

27,Silicon RF power amplifiers (PAs) are in various RF front end modules (FEMs) today for handset and WLAN applications. Even though III-V semiconductor-based RF PAs can still offer superior frequency and breakdown performance with higher POUT and power-added-efficiency (PAE) and faster time-to-market. silicon-based RF PAs do have the advantages in offering higher monolithic integration with added functionalities (e.g.. on-chip digital control and selection on power level. modulation. frequency band. matching. predistortion. etc.). which can translate to lower cost and smaller sizes attractive for broadband multi-mode multi-band handset transmitters. Therefore. some key techniques for designing high-efficiency 4G/5G/WLAN broadband wireless silicon PAs will be discussed....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Electrical circuits
28,Although gain of chromosome 5p is one of the most frequent DNA copy-number imbalances in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). the genes that drive its selection remain poorly understood. In a previous cross-sectional clinical study. we showed that the microRNA processor Drosha (located on chromosome 5p) demonstrates frequent copy-number gain and overexpression in cervical SCC. associated with altered microRNA profiles. Here. we have conducted gene depletion/overexpression experiments to demonstrate the functional significance of up-regulated Drosha in cervical SCC cells. Drosha depletion by RNA interference (RNAi) produced significant. specific reductions in cell motility/invasiveness in vitro. with a silent RNAi-resistant Drosha mutation providing phenotype rescue. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering following global profiling of 319 microRNAs in 18 cervical SCC cell line specimens generated two groups according to Drosha expression levels. Altering Drosha levels in individual SCC lines changed the group into which the cells clustered. with gene depletion effects being rescued by the RNAi-resistant mutation. Forty-five microRNAs showed significant differential expression between the groups. including four of 14 that were differentially expressed in association with Drosha levels in clinical samples. miR-31 up-regulation in Drosha-overexpressing samples/cell lines was the highest-ranked change (by adjusted p value) in both analyses. an observation validated by northern blotting. These functional data support the role of Drosha as an oncogene in cervical SCC. by affecting expression of cancer-associated microRNAs that have the potential to regulate numerous protein-coding genes.

29,Aim: An RNA-seq analysis recently identified a 236-nucleotide transcript upstream from malS in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. Here. we investigated its molecular characteristics and function. Materials & methods: RACE and northern blotting were used to determine the molecular characteristics of the sequence. and mutagenesis. microarray. immunoblotting and an invasion assay were used to investigate the functions of the transcript. Results: The transcript was identified as the malS 5'-untranslated region (UTR). which could influence the expression of the flagellar and SPI-1 genes and the invasion of HeLa cells by S. Typhi. Deletion of bax increased the expression of the invasion genes and the invasive capacity of S. Typhi. whereas the expression of the malS 5'-UTR reduced the expression of bax. Conclusion: The malS 5'-UTR reduces the expression of bax and increases the invasive capacity of S. Typhi....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Northern blotting
30,This paper presents the design of a compact 60-GHz phase shifter that provides a 5-bit digital phase control and 360 degrees phase range for beam-forming systems. The phase shifter is designed using the proposed cross-coupled bridged T-type topology and switched-varactor reflective-type topology. The topologies are analyzed using a small-signal equivalent circuit model. Furthermore. the design equations are derived and investigated. To validate the theoretical analysis. 60-GHz 5-bit 360 degrees phase shifters are designed in a commercial 65-nm CMOS technology. The fabricated 360 degrees phase shifter features good performance of 32 phase states from 57 to 64 GHz with an rms phase error of 4.4 degrees. a total insertion loss of 14.3 +/- 2 dB. an rms gain error of 0.5 dB. P-1 dB of better than 9.5 dBm. and the power consumption of almost zero. To the best of our knowledge. the designed 360 degrees phase shifter with the size of 0.094 mm(2) is the smallest 5-bit passive phase shifter at frequencies around 60 GHz....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
31,By differential high-throughput RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) we have identified "product RNAs" (pRNAs) as short as 8-12 nucleotides that are synthesized by Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase (RNAP) in vivo using the regulatory 6S-1 RNA as template. The dRNA-seq data were confirmed by in vitro transcription experiments and northern blotting. In our libraries. we were unable to detect statistically meaningful numbers of reads potentially representing pRNAs derived from 6S-2 RNA. However. pRNAs could be synthesized in vitro from 6S-2 RNA as template by the B. subtilis sigma(A) RNAP. 6S-1 pRNA levels are low during exponential. increase in stationary and burst during outgrowth from stationary phase. demonstrating that pRNA synthesis is a conserved regulatory mechanism. but a more dynamic and fine-tuning process than previously thought. Most pRNAs have a length of 8-15 nt. very few up to 24 nt. The average length of pRNAs tended to increase from stationary to outgrowth conditions. Synthesis of pRNA is initiated at C40 of 6S-1 RNA and U41 of 6S-2 RNA. yielding pRNAs with a 5'-terminal G or A residue. respectively. A B. subtilis 6S-1 RNA mutant strain encoding a pRNA with a 5'-terminal A residue showed the same relative distribution of similar to 14-nt pRNAs between the different growth states. but generally displayed lower pRNA levels than the reference strain encoding wild-type 6S-1 RNA. A similar to two-fold lower affinity of the C40U mutant 6S-1 RNA towards sigma(A) RNAP may have contributed to this reduction in pRNA levels. We infer that 6S-1 pRNA synthesis. although evolutionarily optimized for initiation with a + 1G residue. is not primarily regulated at the transcription initiation level via growth phase-dependent variations in the cellular GTP pool....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,DNA/RNA sequencing
32,The "central dogma" of molecular biology describes how information contained in DNA is transformed into RNA and finally into proteins. In order for proteins to maintain their functionality in both the parent cell and subsequent generations. it is essential that the information encoded in DNA and RNA remains unaltered. DNA and RNA are constantly exposed to damaging agents. which can modify nucleic acids and change the information they encode. While much is known about how cells respond to damaged DNA. the importance of protecting RNA has only become appreciated over the past decade. Modification of the nucleobase through oxidation and alkylation has long been known to affect its base-pairing properties during DNA replication. Similarly. recent studies have begun to highlight some of the unwanted consequences of chemical damage on mRNA decoding during translation. Oxidation and alkylation of mRNA appear to have drastic effects on the speed and fidelity of protein synthesis. As some mRNAs can persist for days in certain tissues. it is not surprising that it has recently emerged that mRNA-surveillance and RNA-repair pathways have evolved to clear or correct damaged mRNA....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Molecular biology
33,A cDNA clone of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. encoding auxin binding protein 1 (ABP1). one of the putative receptors of auxin. was isolated. and the seasonal expression of ABP1 in relation to IAA and ABA annual variation was investigated by different technical approaches including RT-PCR. real-time PCR. northern blotting. western blotting. and immunolocalization. In the cambial region. ABP1 expression at both the protein and the mRNA level was found to be high. low. and remarkably scarce in the active. quiescent. and resting stages. respectively. during cambium periodicity. The signal abundance of ABP1 follows the opposite pattern to ABA accumulation and correlates with auxin responsiveness of the cambial tissues. suggesting a role for ABP1 in mediating auxin-dependent regulation of cambial activation in the activity-dormancy cycle. This paper attempts to explain why IAA would 'boost' the reactivation of a quiescent cambium. and not that of a resting cambium. Results also show that ABP1 expression is improved by IAA. while inhibited by ABA....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Polymerase chain reaction
34,The monkey is an important experimental model in the pharmacological evaluation of new drugs. We isolated monkey multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) cDNA to examine expression profiles among various tissues and measured ATPase activity to assess substrate specificity. The amino acid sequence encoded by monkey MRP2 cDNA was very similar (96% identity) to the reported human MRP2 cDNA (GenBank accession no. NM_000392). The tissue distribution of MRP2 in monkeys was partially different from that in humans. We found relatively high expression of MRP2 in the monkey kidney and small intestine using Northern blotting. Substrate specificity was compared between human and monkey MRP2. The affinity of 17 beta-estradiol 17-(beta-D-glucuronide). methotrexate. vinblastine. and probenecid to monkey MRP2 was higher than that to human MRP2. Functional and expression differences between human and monkey MRP2 should be incorporated into the evaluation of candidate drugs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

35,Introduction: Most disseminated cancers remain fatal despite the availability of a variety of conventional and novel treatments including surgery. chemotherapy. radiotherapy. immunotherapy. and biologically targeted therapy. A major factor responsible for the failure of chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer is the development of multidrug resistance (MDR). The overexpression of various ABC transporters in cancer cells can efficiently remove the anticancer drug from the cell. thus causing the drug to lose its effect.Areas covered: In this review. we summarised the ongoing research related to the mechanism. function. and regulation of ABC transporters. We integrated our current knowledge at different levels from molecular biology to clinical trials. We also discussed potential therapeutic strategies of targeting ABC transporters to reverse MDR in cancer cells.Expert opinion: Involvement of various ABC transporters to cancer MDR lays the foundation for developing tailored therapies that can overcome MDR. An ideal MDR reversal agent should have broad-spectrum ABC-transporter inhibitory activity. be potent. have good pharmacokinetics. have no trans-stimulation effects. and have low or no toxicity. Alternatively. nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems containing both the cytotoxic drug and reversing agent may represent a useful approach to reversing MDR with minimal off-target toxicity....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
36,PurposeDespite being the third most common ABCA4 variant observed in patients with Stargardt disease. the functional effect of the intronic ABCA4 variant c.5461-10T>C is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular effect of this variant. MethodsFibroblast samples from patients carrying the ABCA4 variant c.5461-10T>C were analysed by isolating total RNA. followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using specific primers spanning the variant. For detection of ABCA4 protein. fibroblast samples were lysed and analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using a monoclonal ABCA4 antibody. ResultsThe ABCA4 variant c.5461-10T>C causes a splicing defect resulting in the reduction of full-length mRNA in fibroblasts from patients and the presence of alternatively spliced mRNAs where exon 39-40 is skipped. A reduced level of full-length ABCA4 protein is observed compared to controls not carrying the variant. ConclusionsThis study describes the functional effect and the molecular mechanism of the pathogenic ABCA4 variant c.5461-10T>C. The variant is functionally important as it leads to splicing defects and a reduced level of ABCA4 protein....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Myelofibrosis
37,Objective/Background: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have already been identified as key players in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However. the current data remain inconclusive. In this study. the expression of MMPs at mRNA and protein levels were investigated in relation to the degradation of collagen I and collagen III. Methods: Tissue samples were obtained from 40 patients with AAA undergoing open aortic repair. and from five healthy controls during kidney transplantation. Expression of MMPs 1. 2. 3. 7. 8. 9. and 12. and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)1. and TIMP2 were measured at the mRNA level using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. At the protein level. MMPs. collagen I. and collagen III. and their degradation products carboxy-terminal collagen cross-links (CTX)-I and CTX-III. were quantified via enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. In addition. immunohistochemistry and gelatine zymography were performed. Results: In AAA. significantly enhanced mRNA expression was observed for MMPs 3. 9. and 12 compared with controls (p <= .001). MMPs 3. 9. and 12 correlated significantly with macrophages (p = .007. p = .018. and p = .015. respectively). and synthetic smooth muscle cells with MMPs 1. 2. and 9 (p = .020. p = .018. and p = .027. respectively). At the protein level. MMPs 8. 9. and 12 were significantly elevated in AAA (p = .006. p = .0004. and p < .001. respectively). No significant correlation between mRNA and protein was observed for any MMP. AAA contained significantly reduced intact collagen I (twofold; p = .002). whereas collagen III was increased (4.6 fold; p < .001). Regarding degraded collagen I and III relative to intact collagens. observations were inverse (1.4 fold increase for CTX-1 [p < .001]; fivefold decrease for CTX-III [p = .004]). MMPs 8. 9. and 12 correlated with collagen I (p = .019. p < .001. and p = 0.003. respectively). collagen III (p = .015. p < .001. and p < .001. respectively). and degraded collagen I (p = .012. p = .049. and p = .001. respectively). Conclusion: No significant relationship was found between mRNA and protein and MMP levels. MMPs 9 and 12 were overexpressed in AAA at the mRNA and protein level. and MMP-8 at the protein level. MMP-2 was detected in synthetic SMCs. Collagen I and III showed inverse behaviour in AAA. In particular. MMPs 8. 9. and;12 appear to be associated with collagen I. collagen III. and their degradation products. (C) 2017 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

38,Purpose of review One of the most important challenges in the intestinal ( ITx) and multivisceral transplant ( MVTx) is to achieve a successful abdominal wall closure. Recent findings A tension-free primary closure should be our aim. In most of the cases. we need to perform a component separation technique. alone or combined. to the use of a synthetic mesh. If those options are not feasible. the abdominal wall composite vascularized allograft transplant ( AW-CVA) utilizing direct orthotopic vascularization can be considered. The nonvascularized abdominal rectus fascia has also become an alternative method used worldwide. proving to be simple and well tolerated procedure. Furthermore. the use of the AW has been recently proposed as a new tool for a sentinel monitoring of the intestinal or pancreas allograft. Summary There are different validated options for abdominal wall closure following intestinal transplantation. The long-term benefits of transplanting the abdominal wall. full or partial thickness and vascularized or nonvascularised. were shown. New developments might help to expand their applications in different areas such as reconstructive surgery and immunology....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Digestive Health
39,The Arabidopsis thaliana late embryogenesis abundant gene AtEm6 is required for normal seed development and for buffering the rate of dehydration during the latter stages of seed maturation. However. its function in salt stress tolerance is not fully understood. In this investigation. cell suspension cultures of three plant species rice (Oryza sativa L.). cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). and white pine (Pinus strobes L.) were transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 harboring pBI-AtEm6. Integration of the AtEm6 gene into the genome of rice. cotton. and white pine has been confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Southern blotting. and northern blotting analyses. Three transgenic cell lines from each of O. sativa. G. hirsutum. and P. strobus were used to analyze salt stress tolerance conferred by the overexpression of the AtEm6 gene. Our results demonstrated that expression of the AtEm6 gene enhanced salt tolerance in transgenic cell lines. A decrease in lipid peroxidation and an increment in antioxidant enzymes ascorbate peroxidase. glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase activities were observed in the transgenic cell lines. compared to the non- transgenic control. In rice. AtEM6 increased expression of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase genes OsCPK6. OsCPK9. OsCPK10. OsCPK19. OsCPK25. and OsCPK26 under treatment of salt. These results suggested that overexpression of the AtEM6 gene in transgenic cell lines improved salt stress tolerance by regulating expression of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase genes. Overexpression of the AtEM6 gene could be an alternative choice for engineering plant abiotic stress tolerance....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Polymerase chain reaction
40,A novel gene. named NgAOX1a. was isolated from Nicotiana glutinosa by RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR). The full-length cDNA of NgAOX1a was 1448 bp. including a 1062-bp ORF (open reading frame). a 124 bp 5' UTR (untranslated region) and a 262 bp 3' UTR. The ORF encodes a 353-amino-acid protein which contains two conserved cysteine residues. four iron-binding motifs. five alpha-helix regions and six conserved histidine residues. The phylogenetic tree showed that NgAOX1a belongs to the AQX1 (alternative oxidase 1)-type group. Alignment analysis showed that NgAOX1a shares a high similarity with other known AOXs. Four exons and three introns were detected in the genomic DNA sequence. and Southern-blotting analysis suggested that NgAOX1a is a single-copy gene. A series of putative cis-acting elements were examined in the 5'-flanking region of NgAOX1a. Northern-blotting analysis showed that the transcript levels of NgAOX1a can be markedly accumulated when tobacco seedlings are treated with various abiotic stimuli. such as exogenous signalling molecules for plant defence response. salicylic acid and H2O2. and the exogenous TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle metabolite citrate. However. it could be suppressed by abiotic stress. such as CoCl2. an inhibitor of ethylene. which indicates that the expression of NgAOX1a may be regulated by ethylene. In addition. NgAOX1a can also be strongly induced by three viral pathogens. tobacco mosaic virus. potato virus X and potato virus Y. These results indicate that NgAOX1a may be involved in multi-signal transduction pathways and may play an important role in defence response....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,DNA/RNA sequencing
41,To identify genes expression in Chenopodium album exposed to NaCl stress and screen ESTs related to salt stress. a subtractive suppression hybridization (SSH) library of C. album under salt stress was constructed in the present study. Random EST sequencing produced 825 high-quality ESTs with GenBank ID GE746311-GE747007. which had 301 bp of average size and were clustered into 88 contigs and 550 singletons. They were classified into 12 categories according to their function annotations. 635 ESTs (76.97%) showed similarities to gene sequences in the non-redundancy database. while 190 ESTs (23.03%) showed low or no similarities. The transcriptional profiles of 56 ESTs randomly selected from 347 unknown or novel ESTs of SSH library under varying NaCl concentration and at different time points were analyzed. The results indicated that a high proportion of tested ESTs were activated by salt stress. Four in 56 ESTs responded to NaCl were also enhanced in expression level when exposed to ABA and PEG stresses. The above four ESTs were validated by northern blotting which was consistent with the results of RT-PCR. The results suggested that genes corresponded to these ESTs might be involved in stress response or regulation. The complete sequences and detailed function of these ESTs need to be further studied....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Northern blotting
42,Phosphorylation of protein kinases has profound effects on their activity and interaction with other proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation was reported to be involved in various physiological processes in plants; however. no typical receptor tyrosine kinase has been isolated from plants thus far. Dual-specificity kinases are potentially responsible for the phosphorylation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine of target proteins. A cDNA clone encoding a putative dual-specificity protein kinase was isolated by screening the cDNA GAL4 activation domain (AD) fusion library of soybean (Glycine max L.). and its entire length was obtained using 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The predicted polypeptide of 330 amino acid residues. designated as GmSTY1. contains all 11 conserved subdomains. which share common characteristics with both the serine/ threonine and tyrosine protein kinases reported thus far. In addition. three potential N-linked glycosylation sites (NXS/T). as well as phosphorylation motifs (SXXXS/T). were observed. suggesting that GmSTY1 may be post-translationally modified. Furthermore. a potential N-myristoylation motif (MGARCSK) was found. suggesting that the GmSTY1 protein could associate with membranes in vivo. Southern blotting analysis revealed a single-copy of GmSTY1 in the genome. Northern blotting analysis showed that this gene was upregulated by drought and salt treatment in a time-dependent manner; however. exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) could not significantly affect the mRNA accumulation of GmSTY1. Interestingly. the transcript of this gene was remarkably downregulated by cold treatment during the early stages of the response. but upregulated later. These results indicate that the protein kinase was possibly regulated by abiotic stresses in an ABA-independent pathway....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Southern blotting
43,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are signalling modules that transduce extracellular signalling to a range of cellular responses. Plant MAPK cascades have been implicated in development and stress response. In this study. we isolated a novel group C MAPKK gene. ZmMKK4. from maize. Northern blotting analysis revealed that the ZmMKK4 transcript expression was up-regulated by cold. high salt and exogenous H(2)O(2). but down-regulated by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). Over-expression of ZmMKK4 in Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to cold and salt stresses by increased germination rate. lateral root numbers. plant survival rate. chlorophyll. proline and soluble sugar contents. and antioxidant enzyme [peroxidase (POD). catalase (CAT)] activities compared with control plants. Furthermore. ZmMKK4 enhanced a 37 kDa kinase activity after cold and salt stresses. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the transcript levels of stress-responsive transcription factors and functional genes were higher in ZmMKK4-over-expressing plants than in control plants. In addition. ZmMKK4 protein is localized in the nucleus. Taken together. these results indicate that ZmMKK4 is a positive regulator of salt and cold tolerance in plants....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Northern blotting
44,Citrullus colocynthis (L.) Schrad. is commonly known as colocynth. The fruit pulp of colocynth has medicinal properties while the seeds have nutritive qualities. C. colosynthis is resistant to high temperatures and grows in the desert regions of North Africa. the Middle East and Western Asia. C. colocynthis likely carries genes of interest that could be explored for inducing abiotic stress resistance in transgenic plants. Although the tissue culture and molecular biology of this species have been explored. the latter has been primarily used to resolve taxonomic relationships with other members of the Citrullus genus and curcubits. Genetic mining of the plant is scarce while genetic transformation protocols are also rare.

45,Purpose of review This review provides an update and summary of recent neuropsychological findings in epilepsy focusing on three major clinical topics among the many developments in the field. We will critically outline the current state with regard to cognition in new-onset epilepsies. social cognition in epilepsy. and the long-term outcome of epilepsy surgery and the cognitive outcomes of superselective surgical procedures. Recent findings Current studies indicate that neuropsychological impairments are prevalent already at the onset of epilepsy and even before. social cognition (i.e.. emotion recognition and theory of mind) is impaired in different epilepsy populations. the long-term outcome of epilepsy surgery is mostly characterized by a stable or even improved cognitive status. and superselective epilepsy surgeries are associated with a promising neuropsychological outcome. Summary The high prevalence of cognitive deficits around epilepsy onset challenges the assumption that epilepsy is the major cause of cognitive problems and calls for early neuropsychological diagnostics. Social cognition seems to be a relevant domain that is not yet routinely considered in epilepsy. The cognitive long-term outcome of epilepsy surgery is mostly positive. Stereotactic thermocoagulation and gamma knife surgery appear to be cognitively safe procedures....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Schizophrenia
46,microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in tissue development and the pathology of many diseases. however. the effects and roles of miRNAs in the development of semen abnormalities in infertile males have not yet been investigated. In this study. we analyzed and compared the miRNA expression profiles of abnormal semen from 86 infertile males with normal semen from 86 healthy males using an miRNA microarray. In total. 52 miRNAs were differentially expressed between the abnormal semen of infertile males and the normal semen of healthy males. The differential expression of selected miRNAs was validated by real time qRT-PCR and northern blotting: miR-574-5p. miR-297. miR-122. miR-1275. miR-373. miR-185 and miR-193b were upregulated (fold change >1.5. p<0.001) and miR-100. miR-512-3p. miR-16. miR-19b. miR-23b and miR-26a were downregulated (fold change <0.667. p<0.001) in the semen of infertile males with semen abnormalities.

47,Background: Respiratory morbidity in Australian Indigenous children is higher than their non-Indigenous counterparts. irrespective of urban or remote residence. There are limited studies addressing acute respiratory illness (ARI) in urban Indigenous children. particularly those that address the upper airway microbiome and its relationship to disease. We aimed to describe the prevalence of upper airway viruses and bacteria in symptomatic and asymptomatic urban-based Australian Indigenous children aged less than 5 years. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of data collected at baseline in an ongoing prospective cohort study of urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children registered with a primary health care service in the northern suburbs of Brisbane. Australia. Clinical. demographic and epidemiological data and bilateral anterior nasal swabs were collected on enrolment. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasal swabs to detect 17 respiratory viruses and 7 bacteria. The primary outcome was the prevalence of these microbes at enrolment. Logistic regression was performed to investigate differences in microbe prevalence between children with and without acute respiratory illness with cough as a symptom (ARIwC) at time of specimen collection. Results: Between February 2013 and October 2015. 164 children were enrolled. The median age at enrolment was 18. 0 months (IQR 7.2-34.3). 49.4% were boys and 56 children (34.2%) had ARIwC. Overall. 133/164 (81%) nasal swabs were positive for at least one organism; 131 (79.9%) for any bacteria. 59 (36.2%) for any virus and 57 (34.8%) for both viruses and bacteria. Co-detection of viruses and bacteria was more common in females than males (61.4% vs 38.6%. p = 0.044). No microbes. alone or in combination. were significantly associated with the presence of ARIwC. Conclusions: The prevalence of upper airways microbes in asymptomatic children is similar to non-Indigenous children with ARIwC from the same region. Determining the aetiology of ARIwC in this community is complicated by the high prevalence of multiple respiratory pathogens in the upper airways....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Children's Health
48,We identified a Nodulin-related protein 1 (NRP1) encoded by At2g03440. which was previously reported to be RPS2 interacting protein in yeast-two-hybrid assay. Northern blotting showed that AtNRP1 expression was suppressed by heat stress (42A degrees C) and induced by low temperature (4A degrees C) treatment. Strong GUS staining was observed in the sites of meristematic tissues of pAtNRP1:: GUS transgenic plants. such as shoot apex and root tips. young leaf veins. stamens and stigmas of flowers. and abscission layers of young siliques. To study AtNRP1 biological functions. we have characterized both loss-of-function T-DNA insertion and transgenic overexpression plants for AtNRP1 in Arabidopsis. The T-DNA insertion mutants displayed no obvious difference as compared to wild-type Arabidopsis under heat stress. but the significant enhanced susceptibility to heat stress was revealed in two independent AtNRP1-overexpressing transgenic lines. Further study found that the decreased thermtolerance in AtNRP1-overexpressing lines accompanied significantly decreased accumulation of ABA after heat treatment. which was probably due to AtNRP1 playing a role in negative-feedback regulation of the ABA synthesis pathway. These results support the viewpoint that the application of ABA inhibits nodulation and nodulin-related gene expression and threaten adverse ambient temperature can impact the nodulin-related gene expression....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Northern blotting
49,Although a great deal of progress has been made toward understanding the role of abscisic acid (ABA) in fruit ripening. many components in the ABA signalling pathway remain to be elucidated. Here. a strawberry gene homologous to the Arabidopsis gene ABI1. named FaABI1. was isolated and characterized. The 1641bp cDNA includes an intact open reading frame that encodes a deduced protein of 546 amino acids. in which putative conserved domains were determined by homology analysis. Transcriptional analysis showed that the levels of FaABI1 mRNA expression declined rapidly during strawberry fruit development as evidenced by real-time PCR. semi-quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR. and northern blotting analyses. suggesting that the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase PP2C1 encoded by FaABI1 may be involved in fruit ripening as a negative regulator. The results of Tobacco rattle virus-induced gene silencing and PBI121 vector-mediated overexpression suggested that the down- and up-regulation of FaABI1 mRNA expression levels in degreening strawberry fruit could promote and inhibit ripening. respectively. Furthermore. alteration of FaABI1 expression could differentially regulate the transcripts of a set of both ABA-responsive and ripening-related genes. including ABI3. ABI4. ABI5. SnRK2. ABRE1. CHS. PG1. PL. CHI. F3H. DFR. ANS. and UFGT. Taken together. the data provide new evidence for an important role for ABA in regulating strawberry fruit ripening in the processes of which the type 2C protein phosphatase ABI1 serves as a negative regulator. Finally. a possible core mechanism underlying ABA perception and signalling transduction in strawberry fruit ripening is discussed....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Northern blotting
50,In this paper. the concept of multi-objective optimization is introduced in the automation of the placement task in analog integrated circuits layout design. To bridge the difficulties found on state-of-the-art works on fulfilling proximity constraints. here. cells are organized into proximity groups which implement the desired set of symmetry and proximity requirements. Then. an innovative archived-based multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm. operating over an absolute representation. is proposed to optimize the placement of each proximity group. In contrast to traditional single-objective placement approaches. the resulting Pareto fronts of placements. representing the tradeoffs between the optimization objectives of each group. are combined. bottom-up. through the design hierarchy. until a final front is obtained. This way. the problem's complexity is reduced. and split over multiple executions of the optimization kernel with less design variables. and also. analog designer becomes aware of the design tradeoffs. The proposed multi-objective and hierarchical methodology was implemented. and. experimental results prove that previous efforts on single-objective absolute representations are no match for the obtained floorplans. Furthermore. the obtained Pareto fronts contain the solutions found with the most recent published topological representations for the well-known Microelectronics Center of North Carolina benchmark sets. and. allowed an improvement of placement area up to 23% on a previously optimized folded cascode operational amplifier for the United Microelectronics Corporation 0.13 gm fabrication process.

51,This study examined whether child abuse history in teen mothers impacts offspring externalizing problems indirectly. through its influence on attachment and maternal hostility. In a longitudinal sample of 112 teen mother-child dyads. mothers reported on their own abuse experiences. attachment and maternal hostility were assessed via direct observations. and externalizing problems were measured using maternal reports. Compared with mothers with no abuse history. mothers with a history of sexual and physical abuse were more likely to have an insecurely attached infant. which predicted higher externalizing problems in preschool. which in turn predicted subsequent increases in externalizing problems in Grade 3. Furthermore. relative to the no abuse history group. mothers with a history of sexual and physical abuse showed more hostility toward their child at preschool. which in turn predicted elevated externalizing problems in Grade 3. Mothers' history of either sexual or physical abuse alone did not have significant indirect effects on externalizing problems. Fostering secure attachment and reducing risk for maternal hostility might be important intervention goals for prevention programs involving at-risk mothers with abuse histories.

52,Background This study assessed the knowledge of personal safety skills among children with developmental disabilities and their parents' perceptions of children's knowledge. Method This exploratory study examined the mental health records of 37 children with developmental disabilities referred for an abuse risk reduction group in a community mental health setting. Qualitative analysis of children's responses to questions about personal safety skills (knowledge related to physical development and personal safety. an appropriate and inappropriate touch and safety skills to respond to an inappropriate touch) indicated participants' varied and inconsistent levels of knowledge. Results Consistent with the literature. the results indicate risk factors for sexual abuse among children with developmental disabilities. including children's difficulty distinguishing between an appropriate and inappropriate touch and the lack of knowledge regarding appropriate venues for disclosing an inappropriate touch. Among parents. a lack of certainty regarding their children's knowledge and the ability to keep themselves safe was identified. Conclusion Results support the need for education about personal safety for children with developmental disabilities and their families....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
53,Introduction: Posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS) are associated with increased risk of obstetric complications among pregnant survivors of trauma. abuse and interpersonal violence. but little is known about how PTS affects women's actual experiences of obstetric care. This study investigated the rate at which abuse history was detected by obstetricians. whether abuse survivors experienced more invasive exams than is typically indicated for routine obstetric care. and whether psychological distress was associated with abuse survivors' sense of self-efficacy when communicating their obstetric care needs.Methods: Forty-one pregnant abuse survivors completed questionnaires about abuse history. current psychological distress and self-efficacy for communicating obstetric care needs and preferences. Electronic medical records (EMRs) were reviewed to examine frequency of invasive prenatal obstetric procedures (e.g. removal of clothing for external genital examination. pelvic exams and procedures) and to examine the detection rate of abuse histories during the initial obstetric visit.Results: The majority of participants (83%) reported at least one past incident of violent physical or sexual assault. Obstetricians detected abuse histories in less than one quarter of cases. Nearly half of participants (46%) received invasive exams for non-routine reasons. PTS and depression symptoms were associated with lower self-efficacy in communicating obstetric care preferences.Discussion: Women most at risk for experiencing distress during their obstetric visits and/or undergoing potentially distressing procedures may also be the least likely to communicate their distress to obstetricians. Results are discussed with implications for improving screening for abuse screening and distress symptoms as well as need for trauma-sensitive obstetric practices....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Stress Management
54,This paper tests the hypothesis that the association between childhood maltreatment and adult personality dysfunction is at least partially attributable to insecure attachment. that is that attachment style mediates the relationship between childhood maltreatment and adult personality dysfunction. Associations between childhood trauma. as measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). anxious and avoidant attachment in romantic relationships. as measured by the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R). and five personality domains. as measured by the Severity Indices of Personality Problems (SIPP-118). were examined in a sample of 72 psychiatric inpatients. The SIPP-118 domains included relational capacities. identity integration. self-control. responsibility. and social concordance. The direct effect of childhood trauma on all SIPP-118 domains was not significant after controlling for the indirect effect of attachment. In regression modeling. a significant indirect effect of childhood trauma via adult attachment style was found for SIPP-118 relational capacities. identity integration. self-control. and social concordance. Specifically. anxious attachment was a significant mediator of the effect of childhood trauma on self-control. identity integration. and relational domains. These results suggest that childhood trauma impacts a broad range of personality domains and does so in large part through the pathway of anxious romantic attachment style....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
55,Background: Alterations in gray matter development represent a potential pathway through which childhood abuse is associated with psychopathology. Several prior studies find reduced volume and thickness of prefrontal (PFC) and temporal cortex regions in abused compared with nonabused adolescents. although most prior research is based on adults and volume-based measures. This study tests the hypothesis that child abuse. independent of parental education. predicts reduced cortical thickness in prefrontal and temporal cortices as well as reduced gray mater volume (GMV) in subcortical regions during adolescence. Methods: Structural MRI scans were obtained from 21 adolescents exposed to physical and/or sexual abuse and 37 nonabused adolescents (ages 13-20). Abuse was operationalized using dichotomous and continuous measures. We examined associations between abuse and brain structure in several a priori-defined regions. controlling for parental education. age. sex. race. and total brain volume for subcortical GMV. Significance was evaluated at p < .05 with a false discovery rate correction. Results: Child abuse exposure and severity were associated with reduced thickness in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC). right lateral orbitofrontal cortex. right inferior frontal gyrus. bilateral parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). left temporal pole. and bilateral inferior. right middle. and right superior temporal gyri. Neither abuse measure predicted cortical surface area or subcortical GMV. Bilateral PHG thickness was inversely related to externalizing symptoms. Conclusions: Child abuse. an experience characterized by a high degree of threat. is associated with reduced cortical thickness in ventromedial and ventrolateral PFC and medial and lateral temporal cortex in adolescence. Reduced PHG thickness may be a mediator linking abuse with externalizing psychopathology. although prospective research is needed to evaluate this possibility....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
56,The significant co-occurrence between men's violence against female partners and child abuse and neglect is well documented. It is less clear how child safety should be managed in family violence research with their mothers. This issue is salient to isafe. a New Zealand-based Internet intervention study testing improvement in safety decisions and mental health outcomes for women experiencing intimate partner violence.

57,Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a global public health problem with major consequences for the individual child and society. An earlier Swedish study showed that the school nurses did not initially talk about nor mention CSA as one form of child abuse. For the child to receive adequate support. the disclosure is a precondition and is dependent on an available person prepared to listen. The aim of the study was to explore the ability of the school nurses to detect and support sexually abused children. It is a secondary analysis of focus group interviews with school nurses. Thematic analysis was performed. Results showed that the school nurses avoided addressing CSA due to arousal of strong emotions. ambivalence. and a complicated disclosure process. In order to detect CSA and support abused children. attentiveness of sexual abuse as a possible cause of physical and mental illhealth is crucial....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health
58,The current study examined the mediating effects of the teacher and peer relationships between parental abuse/neglect and a child's emotional/behavioral problems. A total of 2070 student surveys from the panel of the Korean Child Youth Panel Study (KCYPS) were analyzed by path analysis. The key findings of this study are outlined below. Firstly. parental physical and emotional abuse and neglect had significant effects on children's problems. The direct effect of parental abuse on emotional/behavioral problems was higher than the direct effect of parental neglect on emotional/behavioral problems. Secondly. the teacher relationship partially mediated the effects of the parental abuse/neglect on emotional/behavioral problems. Thirdly. the peer relationship also partially mediated the effects of parental abuse/neglect on children's emotional/behavioral problems. The indirect effect of parental neglect via teacher relationships and peer relationships was stronger than the indirect effect of parental abuse. This study is significant in that it identified that parental abuse/neglect was mediated by the teacher and peer relationship. thereby suggesting an implication for effective intervention with children who have suffered abuse and neglect. In terms of the teacher and peer relationship. understanding the influence of parental abuse and neglect on children's problems was discussed. and the limitations and recommendations for future study were suggested.

59,Abuse-related trauma remains a global health issue. However. there is paucity in nationwide reports. We aim to estimate the incidence of abuse-related trauma forward medical care and identify its characteristics and clinical course in Taiwan. Patients with trauma between 2005 and 2007 that occurred 3 months before or after a diagnosis of abuse were identified from a randomly sampled nationwide longitudinal health insurance database of 1 million beneficiaries. The patients' demographic data. injury pattern. and medical resource utilization were measured. stratified by age and sex. and compared using chi-square test. Risk factors of next trauma event were identified using Cox regression analysis. Ninety-three patients (65 females) were identified (mean age. 20.6 +/- 16.3 years). including 61.3% under 18 years of age. For the first trauma event. 68 patients (73.1%) visited the emergency room. 63 (67.7%) received intervention. and 14 (15.1%) needed hospital care. Seven (7.5%). all less than 11 years old. had intracranial hemorrhage and required intensive care. Thirty-three (35.5%) left with complications or sequelae. or required rehabilitation. but all survived. Of the 34 victims of sexual abuse. 32 were aged less than 18 years. Men received more mood stabilizers or antipsychotics (50.0% vs 10.7%. P = 0.030) and reeducative psychotherapy (25.0% vs 0. P = 0.044). Risk factors for a next trauma event were injury involving the extremities (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.27 [2.45-11.33]) and use of antibiotics (HR: 4.21 [1.45-12.24]) on the first trauma event. Abuse-related trauma has heterogeneous presentations among subgroups. Clinicians should be alert in providing timely diagnosis and individualized intervention....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Mental Health
60,Purpose of review This review addresses some of the more salient articles in the field of child maltreatment published in 2015. with a goal of helping the general practitioner understand the evolution of research in the field of child abuse pediatrics (a board-certified specialty since 2009). Recent findings Researchers continue to refine the database for child abuse pediatrics. Several articles focus on the inconsistencies in approach to the evaluation of possible physical child abuse between hospitals and practitioners. Multiple researchers aim to develop a protocol that standardizes the response to findings of a sentinel injury. such as a rib fracture. abdominal trauma. or unexplained bruising in a nonambulatory infant. Professionals are also working to improve our understanding about the impact of trauma on children and how best to ameliorate its effects. Summary With solid. evidence-based literature published on various topics in the field of child abuse pediatrics. experts work to refine and unify the clinician's approach to the evaluation of possible physical abuse....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health

62,The frequency and severity of physical abuse influences children's outcomes. yet little theory-based research has explored what predicts its course. This study examined the potential role of social information processing (SIP) factors in the course of abuse. Mothers with histories of perpetrating physical abuse (N = 62) completed measures of SIP. and the frequency and severity of mother-perpetrated physical abuse were collected from Child Protection Services records. Poorer problem-solving capacities were significantly related to greater frequency of physical abuse. Hostile attributions toward children were positively associated with abuse severity. Controlling for demographics and co-occurrence of neglect. SIP factors together accounted for a significant proportion of variance in the frequency of physical abuse. but not severity. With the exception of unrealistic expectations. preliminary evidence supported a link between maternal SIP and the course of abuse perpetration. Future research directions and implications for intervention are discussed....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
63,Shaken baby syndrome is a term often used by the physicians and public to describe abusive trauma inflicted on infants and young children. Advances in the understanding of the mechanisms and the associated clinical spectrum of injury has lead us to modify our terminology and address it as "abusive trauma" (AT). Pediatric abusive head trauma is defined as an injury to the skull or intracranial contents of an infant or a young child (<5 y age) due to inflicted blunt impact and/or violent shaking. This chapter focuses on the imaging aspects of childhood abusive trauma along with a brief description of the mechanismand pathophysiology of abusive injury. The diagnosis of AT is not always obvious. and abusive injuries in many infants may remain unrecognized. Pediatricians should be cognizant of AT since pediatricians play a crucial role in the diagnosis. management and prevention of AT....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health

65,An analytic design guide to design a three-stage cascade CMOS operational amplifier compensated by AC boosting frequency compensation (ACBC) method is presented in this paper. The procedure allows electrical parameters such as gain bandwidth (GBW) product or phase margin to be related to the value of circuit elements such as aspect ratio or biasing currents of transistors. The presented design guide is suited for pencil-and-paper design and yields accurate performance without unnecessary circuit constraint introduction. Simulation results using TSMC 0.18 mu m CMOS process verifies accuracy and robustness of proposed procedure. Various load capacitors and circuit conditions are simulated and. based on obtained results. the presented design guide is comprehensive and efficient since it leads us from frequency response parameters to aspect ratio of MOSFETs....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Operational amplifier
66,Programmable AC power sources have been widely used to implement and support a wide range of Test Procedure Specifications (TPS's). Traditionally. these power sources use analog control circuits to provide key control and protection functions like load regulation. current limit and frequency conversion. While this is a proven design. it suffers from a number of drawbacks. With the advent of recent advances in DSP technologies. a full digital implementation of an AC power source design supporting high switching frequencies is now feasible.

68,The voltage source converters (VSC) are the key power interfaces between the individual ac grids and dc grids in the hybrid power system. When the ac grid is unbalanced. the grid currents are distorted and the harmonic is induced. Meanwhile. the oscillations in the active and reactive power are also increased. which may damage these interfaces. In order to ensure the safety of the converters and the grid facility. a flexible control strategy is proposed for the ac/dc hybrid grid in this paper. At first. the current harmonic for the VSC is theoretically analyzed under unbalanced conditions. Furthermore. the methods to separate the positive- and negative-sequence components of the ac grid voltages are summed up and analyzed. Based on the theoretical analysis. different protected control methods are compared. A new control method. which can flexibly control oscillations of the active and reactive power by introducing a parameter k. has been proposed. The estimation of maximum current in each phase is discussed; meanwhile. the relationship between the voltage ripple on dc link and the parameter k is given. Finally. the validity and advantages of the proposed method are verified by the simulating and experimental results....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Electrical network
69,Based on single-phase ac-ac converter with controllable phase and amplitude (ACCPA). a three-phase ACCPA without third harmonic trap was proposed for power transmission control in grid by adopting a symmetrical relationship of three phase. The three-phase ACCPA is comprised of two parts. which are used to adjust the phase and amplitude of three-phase output voltage. respectively. and continuously. Its front part is made up of three buck-type ac converters. and the back part is a three-phase boost-type ac converter. The operation principle of three-phase ACCPA. the adjustable ranges of the phase and amplitude of the front part. and the calculation formulas of control parameters under ideal conditions were studied and deduced in detail. Furthermore. the control accuracy of the phase angle was discussed for the three-phase ACCPA with digital control. and then. the method to select close-loop control parameters was obtained. The control strategy of three-phase ACCPA was presented and a prototype was fabricated. The experimental waveforms and testing results verified the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the feasibility of the control strategy....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Control engineering

The algorithm is carried out in C language using MATLAB S-Function block so it is suitable for implementation in the real-time control systems....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
71,Various species of amoebas belonging to the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in many parts of the world. Some strains of these protozoans may exist as parasites and pose risks to human health as causative agents of serious human diseases. Currently in China there IS a lack of information about the distribution of Acanthamoeba strains in the environment. Accordingly. 261 environmental water samples taken from rivers. sewage. and pharmaceutical factory drains were collected in Qinghai Province. China. The material was filtered and then analysed with both LAMP and PCR assays. Of the samples examined. Acanthamoeba DNA was found in 32 (14.68%) samples with the use of LAMP; in 13 of these samples. DNA from this amoeba was also detected using PCR. Sequencing of selected positive samples confirmed that the PCR products were fragments of the Acanthamoeba 18S rRNA gene and that isolates represent the T4 genotype. known as the Most common strain related to AK cases. The results indicate that surface water. as well as water taken from sewage And pharmaceutical drains. may be a source of acanthamoebic strains potentially pathogenic for humans in China. It has been also demonstrated that LAMP assays is more sensitive than PCR and can be regarded as useful tool for screening the environment for Acanthamoeba spp. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

72,Particle accelerators consist of an enormous number of components and many of them operate with pulse voltage or current. Such accelerator components require precise voltage or current to keep the beams very stable. For this reason. many pulse power supplies used for accelerators have own subsystems to improve their performances. One example is a power supply for the scanning magnets of a pencil beam proton therapy. They use not only high-voltage inverters for the high-speed ramping but also low-voltage inverters for the precise current control. However. the use of intelligent digital controllers possibly simplifies such precise power supplies. We propose a method for precise current control using a digital control system. Our previous work has successfully controlled the pulse current of power supplies for synchrotron main magnets. In the next step. we have modified our previous method for faster power supplies such as ones for scanning magnets. In addition. we developed a control board using a high-performance FPGA so that our method can be implemented in the board. In this paper. we describe the details of our proposed method. and the experiments using a small-scale power supply and the developed control board....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control

74,A high performance interface circuit of sigma-delta accelerometer with low harmonic distortion used many kinds of circuit processing techniques is presented in this work. Multi-bit. dynamic element matching. correlated-double-sampling and electrostatic force feedback linearization circuit are used simultaneously in order to achieve the design indicators. Because of the usage of multi-bit. the design to operational amplifier (OPA) becomes easier. and only a single-stage folded-cascode amplifier is used in the modulator. the OSR is only 64. It highly reduced the difficulty of circuit. The test results indicate that the chip area is only about 10mm(2) and the power dissipation is 10mW with a sampling frequency of 60 kHz. The dynamic range (DR) of the system can be lower than -130 dB. the SNR and SNDR reach to -120 dB and -110 dB respectively with a resolution about 17 bits when referred to 3g full scale DC acceleration under CMOS 0.5 mu m process.

75,In this article we address the increasingly important yet understudied phenomenon of nonnative accentedness on decision making. In three experimental studies. we investigated whether messages about a company delivered in nonstandard-American-accented speech influenced choice. In Study 1. we found that individuals were more likely to choose a company or a product when a message was read in a standard American English accent than when the message was delivered with a Mandarin Chinese or a French accent. In Study 2. we found that expectations regarding company messages are violated when speakers have accents and that. in turn. expectation violations mediated the relationship between accent and choice. In Study 3. we replicated the findings of the effect of accent on choice using Indian and British accents. We also hypothesized and found support for a conditional indirect effects model such that implicit pro-American bias moderated the indirect relationship between accent and choice as mediated by expectation violations. Theoretical and practical implications of this topic of study are discussed....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Prejudice
76,Acceptance is a key construct in both rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). The objectives of this study were to assess and compare the properties of ACT acceptance with those of REBT acceptance in predicting emotions. A sample of 112 subjects. comprising different educational and occupational status. completed three measures of acceptance (REBT and ACT). two of mindfulness. as well as completing depression and anxiety scales. Both ACT acceptance as process and REBT acceptance could predict significant ACT acceptance as outcome. Mindfulness as a trait also predicted the level of ACT outcome acceptance as well as the level of REBT acceptance. but mindfulness as process predicted only ACT outcome acceptance. The results show that REBT acceptance. ACT acceptance and mindfulness can explain anxiety and depression in different ways. The results show that the difference between ACT acceptance and REBT acceptance primary concern the process of acceptance. most likely due to the underlying cognitive processing. The outcome acceptance and emotional level are similar in the two conditions. Future research should employ multiple cognitive measurements....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Depression

78,OBJECTIVE: Cervical imaging practices are poorly understood in young children with traumatic brain injury (TBI). We therefore sought to identify child-level and hospital-level factors associated with performance of cervical imaging of children with TBI from falls and abusive head trauma (AHT) and to describe across-hospital variation in cervical imaging performance. We hypothesized that imaging decisions would be influenced by hospital volume of young injured children. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of children younger than 2 years of age with TBI from 2009 to 2013 in the Premier Perspective Database. After adjustment for observed patient characteristics. we evaluated variation in advanced cervical imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) in children with AHT and TBI from falls. RESULTS: Of 2347 children with TBI. 18.7% were from abuse and 57.1% were from falls. Fifteen percent of children with TBI underwent advanced cervical imaging. Moderate or severe head injuries were associated with increased odds of cervical imaging in AHT (odds ratio 7.10; 95% confidence interval 2.75. 18.35) and falls (odds ratio 2.25; 95% confidence interval 1.19. 4.27). There was no association between annual hospital volume of injured children and cervical imaging performance. The adjusted probability of imaging across hospitals ranged from 4.3% to 84.3% in AHT and 3.1 to 39.0% in TBI from falls (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight variation across hospitals in adjusted probability of cervical imaging in AHT (nearly 20-fold) and TBI from falls (over 10-fold) not explained by observed patient characteristics. This variation suggests opportunities for further research to inform imaging practices....,Psychology,Medical,Child abuse,Children's Health

The study also examined the demographic. ethnocultural. and psychological factors that could influence subcontinental migrant groups' attitudes towards acculturation and their acculturation strategies. MethodA cross-sectional design was used in which the dependent variables were the four acculturation strategies. Multivariate data analysis was conducted. Pearson's correlation. analysis of variance. and step-wise multiple regression analyses were performed to establish the relationships among the study variables. ResultsIntegration was the most preferred strategy and marginalisation was the least preferred strategy for all ethnic groups. Acculturation preferences are predicted partly by the adolescents' ethnicity. their ethnic identity. friendship choices. acculturative stress. sense of mastery (self-concept) and gender. The findings provide significant information on the acculturation practices of Indian subcontinental adolescents. including their ethnic identity search and commitment. their psychological well-being and their integration strategies. ConclusionsEducational institutions could benefit from increased awareness of the needs of these culturally diverse groups. especially if this information is incorporated into teacher training materials. The inclusion of intercultural relations courses in the academic curriculum would promote harmonious relations between culturally diverse ethnic groups....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Prejudice
80,In order to improve the dynamic responses of multimode controlled primary-side regulation flyback converter. a novel digital control method is proposed in this paper. A new DAC sampling method. which can capture the output voltage during dynamic transition. is introduced. Based on it. a dynamic module which can monitor the variation of the output voltage to improve the dynamic performance is proposed. In a 5-V/1-A primary-side regulation flyback converter. the maximum undershoot voltage and overshoot voltage of the proposed control scheme in this study are 0.472 and 0.192 V. respectively. They are much lower compared to 1.296 and 0.584 V in the traditional control scheme. The maximum undershoot and overshoot recovery times are reduced from 10.86 to 1.29 ms and 126.3 to 53.68 ms. respectively. The proposed control scheme was then verified by a FPGA controlled prototype....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
81,This study proposes high-performance voltage controller design that employs a capacitor current control model for single-phase stand-alone inverters. The single-phase stand-alone inverter is analyzed via modeling. which is then used to design the controller. A design methodology is proposed to maximize the bandwidth of the feedback controller. Subsequently. to compensate for the problems caused by the bandwidth limitations of the controller. an error transfer function that includes the feedback controller is derived. and the stability of the repetitive control scheme is evaluated using the error transfer function. The digital repetitive controller is then implemented. The simulation and experimental results show that the performance of the proposed controller is high in a 1.5 kW single-phase stand-alone inverter prototype....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Single-phase electric power
82,This work presents a novel mixed-signal control scheme for a boost power factor correction (PFC) rectifier. The digital controller modulates the inductor peak current to produce a low-distortion ac line current in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and continuous conduction mode (CCM). without the need for average current sensing. A lookup table (LUT) optimizes efficiency at low input currents. by allowing operation at 125-500-kHz DCM based on calculated thresholds. At high input currents. the converter operates at 1-MHz CCM for reduced inductor footprint. An analog off-time generator with a digital frequency locked loop facilitates CCM operation. eliminating the need for slope compensation in the current loop and reduces frequency variations. The LUT is programmed with an adaptive output voltage of 250/450 V for low/highmains line voltage (85-265Vrms) to optimize efficiency over a broad range of conditions. The 150-W PFC prototype operates up to 1 MHz with a peak efficiency of 95% and a total harmonic distortion of 5%....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
83,The theoretical and experimental analysis of a modified version of the SEPIC dc-dc converter used as preregulator operating in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) is presented in this paper. The proposed converter presents a low input current ripple operating in DCM. and the switch voltage is lower than the output voltage. The switch voltage reduction increases the converter reliability and a low drain-to-source on-resistance (RDSon) MOSFET can be used depending on the converter specification. Moreover. a digital control technique is applied to the proposed converter in order to reduce the third-harmonic input current distortion resultant of the operation in DCM. Finally. a 100-W prototype was developed operating with efficiency equal to 95.6%....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Electrical circuits
84,In high-performance magnetic resonance imaging systems. the gradient driver is required to supply the gradient coil with a large current (>600 A) and a high voltage (>2000 V) to achieve a strong gradient field and a fast slew rate. In addition. extremely high fidelity for reproducing the current command from the central system is very critical to imaging quality. This paper presents the solutions for the different elements of the driver: 1) high-bandwidth (BW) power inverter; 2) ripple cancelation filter; 3) multioutput power supply (PS); and 4) digital control. A high-BW power inverter requires a stacked-bridges structure to achieve a high output ripple frequency with the existing commercial power semiconductor modules. The high voltage and the high frequency for large power modules can be obtained easier and with lower loss using the new silicon carbide devices. The control needs a digital implementation and a very fast processor. Digital control provides compensation and feedforward to improve the response. A capability improvement is obtained by reducing the switching frequency when large currents with a very low-frequency variation are needed. The control can handle it very well. but the filter has to be designed to eliminate more than one ripple frequency. Finally. many PS solutions have been used for multiple isolated outputs. but digital control compensation permits the use of much simpler unregulated PS and keeps the performance. A 2 MVA. 900 A/1200 V. platform has been built and fully tested. The experimental results proved the validity of the proposed structure and the modulation technique....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
85,Drug release belongs to the most challenging aspects of nanoparticles addressing molecular biology and medicine. Besides targeted delivery. obvious challenges are related to high drug load and continuous slow drug release. Based on our recently developed concept of inorganic-organic hybrid nanoparticles (IOH-NP). we here present [ZrO](2+)[AAP](2-) IOH-NPs containing the analgetic phosphate prodrug acetaminophen phosphate for drug release. [ZrO](2+)[AAP](2-) combines an uncomplex synthesis in water with a high prodrug load of 68 wt.%.[ZrO](2+)[AAP](2-) nanoparticles exhibit a diameter of 37(11) nm and can be readily obtained as colloidally highly stable suspension in water. The chemical composition is studied in detail based on infrared spectroscopy. energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. thermogravimetry and elemental analysis. Moreover. the release of acetaminophen from [ZrO](2+)[AAP](2-) is studied by means of model experiments indicating the carbon content of the nanoparticles and. in alternative. the fluorescence of labeled nanoparticles.

86,We have reported that orally administrated acetate contributed to suppression of lipogenesis in the liver and to reduction of lipid accumulation in the adipose tissue of Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acetate on skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. Treatment with acetate showed a higher rate of oxygen consumption and a smaller size of lipid droplets in white adipose and brown adipose tissues. An analysis by Northern blotting revealed that the transcripts of myoglobin and Glut4 genes in the abdominal muscle of the OLETF rats were increased by acetate treatment. while the transcripts of lipolytic genes increased in the white adipose and brown adipose tissues. It is possible that acetate has effects on lipid metabolism in the skeletal muscles and the adipose tissues. and has functions that work against obesity and obesity-linked type 2 diabetes....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Human Metabolism
87,Acetate has been found to have an inhibitory effect on the activity of carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) in cultured hepatocytes. this being a transcription factor that regulates several genes required for the conversion of glucose to fatty acids in the liver. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an oral administration of acetate would contribute to reducing lypogenic genes and protecting against obesity. We orally injected 5.2mg/kg BW of acetate to obesity-linked type 2 diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. The treatment with acetate showed a marked reduction in lipid accumulation in the adipose tissue. protection against accumulation of fat in the liver. and improved glucose tolerance. An analysis by Northern blotting revealed that the transcripts of several lipogenic genes in the liver of OLETF rats were decreased by the acetate treatment. On the basis of those results. it was indicated that acetate was a potential compound to improve obesity and obesity-linked type 2 diabetes....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Human Metabolism
88,Research was carried out for the appraisal of toxic and anti-enzymetic action of acetone extracts of Datura inoxia and Azadirachta indica against Tribolium castaneum. Trogoderma granarium and Sitophilus granarius in the grain research training and storage management cell of department of entomology and in protein molecular biology laboratory (PMBL) department of biochemistry (UAF) during the year 2014. Various dilution levels viz.. 5.0. 10.0. 15.0 and 20.0% of both plants extracts were assessed against test insects. Toxic effect of plant extracts in T. castaneum. T. granarium and S. granarius was observed after an exposure period of 2. 4. 6. 8 and 10 days while inhibition of different enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE). a-carboxylesterase (alpha-CE). beta-carboxylesterase (beta-CE). acid phosphatases (ACP) and alkaline phosphatases (ALP) were calculated spectrophotometrically in the survivors of toxicity assay. The results evidenced that both plant extracts had lethal effects against three stored grain insect species. Comparison of means of mortality in T. castaneum. T. granarium and S. granarius proved that A. indica extract was more effective. causing maximum 38.41. 24.35 and 28.56% mortality. respectively. D. inoxia resulted in 15.12. 13.52 and 14.07% maximum mortality in T. castaneum. T. granarium and S. granarius. respectively. The results also revealed significant inhibition of AChE. alpha-CE. beta-CE. ACP and ALP upon exposure to various concentrations of tested plants. Plant extract of A. indica proved more efficient for the inhibition of all test enzymes in three stored grain insect pests.

89,Bacterial community analyses of samples from a pilot plant for the treatment of acid mine drainage (AMD) from the lignite-mining district in Lusatia (East Germany) had previously demonstrated the dominance of two groups of acidophilic iron oxidizers: the novel candidate genus "Ferrovum" and a group comprising Gallionella-like strains. Since pure culture had proven difficult. previous studies have used genome analyses of co-cultures consisting of "Ferrovum" and a strain of the heterotrophic acidophile Acidiphilium in order to obtain insight into the life style of these novel bacteria. Here we report on attempts to undertake a similar study on Gallionella-like acidophiles from AMD. Isolates belonging to the family Gallionellaceae are still restricted to the microaerophilic and neutrophilic iron oxidizers Sideroxydans and Gallionella. Availability of genomic or metagenomic sequence data of acidophilic strains of these genera should. therefore. be relevant for defining adaptive strategies in pH homeostasis. This is particularly the case since complete genome sequences of the neutrophilic strains G. capsiferriformans ES-2 and S. lithotrophicus ES-1 permit the direct comparison of the metabolic capacity of neutrophilic and acidophilic members of the same genus and. thus. the detection of biochemical features that are specific to acidophilic strains to support life under acidic conditions. Isolation attempts undertaken in this study resulted in the microaerophilic enrichment culture ADE-12-1 which. based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. consisted of at least three to four distinct Gallionellaceae strains that appear to be closely related to the neutrophilic iron oxidizer S. lithotrophicus ES-1. Key hypotheses inferred from the metabolic reconstruction of the metagenomic sequence data of these acidophilic Sideroxydans strains include the putative role of urea hydrolysis. formate oxidation and cyanophycin decarboxylation in pH homeostasis....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,DNA/RNA sequencing

91,c-Myc overexpression has been implicated in several malignancies including gastric cancer. Here. we report that acidified bile acids enhance tumor progression and telomerase activity in gastric cancer via c-Myc activation both in vivo and in vitro. c-Myc mRNA and protein levels were assessed in ten primary and five local recurrent gastric cancer samples by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting analysis. The gastric cancer cell line MGC803 was exposed to bile salts (100mol/L glycochenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid) in anacidmedium (pH 5.5) for 10min daily for 60weeks to develop an MGC803-resistant cell line. Control MGC803 cells were grown without acids or bile salts for 60weeks as a control. Cell morphology. proliferation. colony formation and apoptosis of MGC803-resistant cells were analyzed after 60weeks. To determine the involvement of c-Myc in tumor progression and telomere aging in MGC803-resistant cells. we generated xenografts in nude mice and measured xenograft volume and in vivo telomerase activity. The c-Myc and hTERT protein and mRNA levels were significantly higher in local recurrent gastric cancer samples than in primary gastric cancer samples. MGC803-resistant cells showed a marked phenotypic change under normal growth conditions with more clusters and acini. and exhibited increased cell viability and colony formation and decreased apoptosis in vitro. These phenotypic changes were found to be dependent on c-Myc activation using the c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4. MGC803-resistant cells also showed a c-Myc-dependent increase in xenograft growth and telomerase activity in vivo. In conclusion. these observations support the hypothesis that acidified bile acids enhance tumor progression and telomerase activity in gastric cancer and that these effects are dependent on c-Myc activity. These findings suggest that acidified bile acids play an important role in the malignant progression of local recurrent gastric cancer....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
92,Thermoelectric (TE) materials are important for the sustainable development because they enable the direct harvesting of low-quality heat into electricity. Among them. conducting polymers have attracted great attention arising from their advantages. such as flexibility. nontoxicity. easy availability. and intrinsically low thermal conductivity. In this work. a novel and facile method is reported to significantly enhance the TE property of poly(3.4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films through sequential post-treatments with common acids and bases. Compared with the as-prepared PEDOT:PSS. both the Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivities can be remarkably enhanced after the treatments. The oxidation level. which significantly impacts the TE property of the PEDOT:PSS films. can also be well tuned by controlling the experimental conditions during the base treatment. The optimal PEDOT:PSS films can have a Seebeck coefficient of 39.2 mu V K-1 and a conductivity of 2170 S cm(-1) at room temperature. and the corresponding power factor is 334 mu W (m(-1) K-2). The enhancement in the TE properties is attributed to the synergetic effect of high charge mobility by the acid treatment and the optimal oxidation level tuned by the base treatment....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electricity
93,Background: Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as an important cause of infection in burn patients. This study aimed to characterize the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. determine the prevalence of oxacillinase and metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) genes. and type the A. baumannii isolates obtained from burn patients. Methods: During a 1-year period. a total of 40 nonduplicated isolates of A. baumannii were obtained from burn patients who were hospitalized in the Taleghani Burn Hospital in Ahvaz. in the southwest of Iran. Testing for antimicrobial susceptibility was carried out by disk diffusion and E-test. To screen MBL production. a double disk synergy and MBL E-test were performed. The presence of bla(OXA-23-like). bla(OXA-24-like). bla(OXA-51-like) and bla(OXA-58-like). bla(VIM). bla(IMP) and bla(SPM). and bla(NDM) was sought by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR was carried out for determination of isolates clonality. Results: Overall. 92.5% of isolates were carbapenem-resistant. Polymyxin B. colistin. and ampicillin-sulbactam were the most effective agents in vitro. with a susceptibility rate of 100%. 97.5%. and 72.5%. respectively. According to the double disk synergy and E-test. 55.6% and 97.3% of isolates were MBL producers. respectively. Furthermore. 70% of isolates harbored bla(OXA-23-like) and 20% were positive for bla(OXA-24-like). However. no encoding genes were detected for bla(VIM). bla(IMP) and bla(SPM). bla(NDM). and bla(OXA-58-like). Repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR revealed that carbapenem-resistant isolates belonged to four clones. including A. B. C. and D; the predominant clones were B and C. Conclusion: The rate of carbapenem resistance was high. and it appeared that bla(OXA-23-like) and bla(OXA-24-like) contributed to the carbapenem resistance of A. baumannii isolates. This result suggests that the two predominant clones of A. baumannii were spread among burn patients. In order to prevent future dissemination of resistant isolates among burn patients. an effective infection control plan is necessary. Copyright (C) 2017.

94,The aim of the present study was to investigate the resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii. which was induced by cefepime (FEP). cefoperazone-sulbactam (SCF). tazobactam (TZP). levofloxacin (LEV). amikacin (AK). imipenem (IPM). and ciprofloxacin (CIP). in vitro. Multi-step drug resistance selection of 16 A. baumannii strains was performed using seven antibacterial agents (FEP. TZP. CIP. AK. IPM. SCF. and LEV). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the agar dilution method. Random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze the genotypes and the carrying rates of aac(3)-I. aac(6)-I. ant(3)-I. aph(3)-Via. OXA-23. OXA-24. AmpC. TEM-1. metallo--lactamase gene (IMP). armA. rmtA. rmtB. parC. gyrA and adeB. Expression of adeB was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Semi-qRT-PCR). Among the 16 strains. 15 strains with drug resistance (93.8%) were obtained following in vitro induction. Notable increases (8- to 128-fold) were noted in the MIC and different genotypes were showed in RAPD of the strains before and after performing the drug resistant test. PCR data revealed significant differences (P<0.05) between the carrying rates of resistant genes before and after drug induction. with the exception of rmtA. OXA-24. TEM-1. and IMP. Significant increases were demonstrated in the comparative adeB grayscale in strains that underwent drug induction when compared with the sensitive strains (55.69 +/- 43.11% vs. 10.08 +/- 26.35%; P=0.001). Findings of the present study suggest that the active efflux pump. adeB. has an important role in multidrug resistance of the A. baumannii induced by antibacterial agents in vitro....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Fungal Infection
95,We characterized 72 isolates with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems (50 Acinetobacter spp.. 13 Proteus mirabilis. five Escherichia coli. one Morganella morganii. one Enterobacter cloacae. one Providencia rettgeri. and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa) from a hospital in Sofia. Bulgaria. Different -lactamase genes were identified by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Bacterial strain typing was performed by enzymatic macrorestriction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing as well as multilocus sequence typing for selected isolates. The majority of Acinetobacter baumannii (46/50) and one Acinetobacter pittii isolate harbored carbapenemase genes bla(OXA-23) or bla(OXA-72); two A. baumannii contained both genes. PFGE typing of all A. baumannii showed the presence of nine different clones belonging to eight sequence types ST350. ST208. ST436. ST437. ST449. ST231. ST502. and ST579. Molecular characterization of the remaining isolates confirmed the presence of one NDM-1-producing E. coli-ST101 clone (five isolates) and one P. mirabilis clone (13 isolates) with VIM-1 and CMY-99. Furthermore. NDM-1 was identified in P. rettgeri and M. morganii and VIM-2 in the P. aeruginosa isolate. The permanent introduction of OXA-23/72 carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii clones into the hospital and the repeated occurrence of one VIM-1-producing P. mirabilis and one NDM-1-producing E. coli-ST101 clone over a period of more than 1 year is of concern and requires intensified investigations....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Fungal Infection
96,Background Acotiamide is widely used to improve symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD) in multiple large-scale clinical studies. but there are few reports about the drug's mechanism of action. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of acotiamide on gastric accommodation and gastric emptying. gastrointestinal symptoms. and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) in a placebo-controlled study. Methods We conducted a randomized. double-blind placebo-controlled study. Fifty Japanese FD patients were randomly assigned to either placebo (n = 25) or acotiamide 100 mg x 3/day for 2 weeks (n = 25). At baseline and at 2 weeks of treatment. we evaluated the patients' gastric motility using scintigraphy to determine the accommodation and emptying values. gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS). HR-QOL (SF-8). and anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Results Four patients failed to complete the medication regimen and were omitted from analysis; data from 24 placebo patients and 22 acotiamide patients were analyzed. Acotiamide significantly increased gastric accommodation compared to the placebo (p = 0.04 vs. p = 0.08; respectively). Acotiamide significantly accelerated gastric emptying (50 % half-emptying time) (p = 0.02 vs. p = 0.59). Acotiamide significantly improved the total GSRS scores compared to placebo (p = 0.0007 vs. p = 0.14). HR-QOL did not differ significantly between the two groups. but acotiamide significantly improved the HADS anxiety score compared to placebo (p = 0.04 vs. p = 0.20). Conclusions Our placebo-controlled study demonstrated that acotiamide significantly increased both gastric accommodation and gastric emptying in Japanese FD patients. Acotiamide also improved the patients' dyspeptic symptoms and anxiety score....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Digestive Health
97,The objective of this study was to determine global gene expression in relation to Vestibular schwannomas (VS) growth rate and to identify signal transduction pathways and functional molecular networks associated with growth. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to surgery determined tumor growth rate. Following tissue sampling during surgery. mRNA was extracted from 16 sporadic VS. Double stranded cDNA was synthesized from the mRNA and used as template for in vitro transcription reaction to synthesize biotin-labeled antisense cRNA. which was hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133A arrays and analyzed by dChip software. Differential gene expression was defined as a 1.5-fold difference between fast and slow growing tumors (>< 0.5 ccm/year). employing a p-value < 0.01. Deregulated transcripts were matched against established gene ontology. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used for identification of signal transduction pathways and functional molecular networks associated with tumor growth. In total 109 genes were deregulated in relation to tumor growth rate. Genes associated with apoptosis. growth and cell proliferation were deregulated. Gene ontology included regulation of the cell cycle. cell differentiation and proliferation. among other functions. Fourteen pathways were associated with tumor growth. Five functional molecular networks were generated. This first study on global gene expression in relation to vestibular schwannoma growth rate identified several genes. signal transduction pathways and functional networks associated with tumor progression.

99,Conversion of mechanical forces. vibrations and sound which have energy in the range of milli- to tens of watts (also referred to as "small kinetic energies" in this paper) into electricity has received global attention owing to the potential in powering electronic devices. However. most of the small kinetic energy generators can only generate electric power below 1 mu W/cm(3). As a result. an energy storage device is required to accumulate the energy generated until it reaches a sufficient level. Herein. we report the exceptionally-high acoustoelectric conversion ability of randomly-orientated electrospun poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) nanofiber nonwoven webs. The optimized device under sound is able to generate peak voltage and current of 14.5 V and 28.5 mu A with a volume power density output of 306.5 mu W/cm(3) (5.9 mW/cm(3) based on nanofiber web thickness). Without accumulation in any energy storage unit. the electricity generated by the nanofiber device is sufficient to light up tens of commercial LEDs. run electrochemical reactions and protect metals from corrosion. Such a novel acoustoelectric generator may offer an effective solution to recycling noise pollution into usable electricity....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electrical generator

1,Objective: To unravel the interplay between HIV-1 and its host cell. the effect of HIV-1 infection on cellular gene expression was investigated. Methods: HIV-1(SF33)-infected and uninfected H9 T cells were screened by differential display and RNase protection assay. The finding (PDS5A) was confirmed in HIV-1(Lai)-infected P4-CCR5 HeLa cells. which were also examined after PDS5A siRNA knockdown in regard to HIV-1 replication by quantitative RT-PCR. p24 ELISA and LTR-driven beta-galactosidase expression. The PDS5A knockdown effect on cellular gene expressions was studied by microarray analysis. PDS5A tissue expression was determined by Northern blotting. Results: Regulator of cohesion maintenance. homolog A (PDS5A) was found to be down-regulated by HIV-1. When PDS5A was suppressed by siRNA. HIV-1 replication was unaffected. PDS5A was found to be highly expressed in skeletal muscle tissue. and to lesser degrees in pancreas. heart. placenta. lung. kidney. liver and brain. Microarray analysis of PDS5A knockdown revealed 91 differential gene products over-representing cell cycle. transport and protein stability regulation. including 4 genes (PP2A. RANTES. PCAF. TCF7L2) previously reported to interact with HIV-1. Conclusion: The data show a downregulation of proliferation-associated host gene PDS5A and suggest a role of PDS5A in HIV-1-induced cellular pathogenesis but not viral replication.

2,Powder coatings have been receiving attention because they are environmentally friendly. They do not contain solvents in their composition. and their components have decorative and corrosion-protection functions. among many others. However. the presence of polymers in their composition increases the risk of combustion in adverse situations. In this context. this study aims to develop and characterize acrylic-based powder paints with the addition of 2 wt % and 4 wt % montmorillonite clays (MMT) as Cloisite 30B (MMT-30B) and Cloisite 15A (MTT-15A). employed as flame retardants. The characterization of the coatings was carried out by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). X-ray diffraction. and scanning electron microscopy. After application of the coatings on carbon steel substrates. flammability tests were performed. The coatings with 2 wt % MMT-30B showed overall better results. especially in the flammability tests. Flames spread less on these coatings than on the other systems. However. when the surface and bottom temperatures were analyzed by the cone calorimeter test. the samples prepared with 4 wt % MMT-15A were considered safer to be applied in fire scenarios.

3,Purpose/Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of quetiapine XR and lithium on actigraphy-measured circadian parameters in patients with bipolar II depression. Methods/Procedures: This was an 8-week. open-label. prospective. randomized comparative study. The assessments included the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score and actigraphic measures concerning the previous 7 days. collected at each visit (weeks 0 [baseline]. 1. 2. 4. 6. and 8); the actigraphic data were analyzed with a cosinor analysis. Findings/Results: Medication. time. and the interaction between medication and time were significantly associated with acrophase for the entire group (Ps = 0.003. 0.020. and 0.042. respectively). More specifically. acrophase was significantly delayed at weeks 1 and 6 (Ps = 0.004 and 0.039. respectively) in the quetiapine XR group. The F statistics significantly increased over time for the entire group (P < 0.001). and there was a significant increase in F statistics on weeks 4 and 6 in the quetiapine XR group (Ps = 0.016 and 0.020. respectively) and on weeks 4 and 8 in the lithium group (Ps = 0.001 and 0.016. respectively). In addition. scores on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were significantly associated with the F statistics during 8 weeks for the entire group (P = 0.008). Implications/Conclusions: Both quetiapine XR and lithium affected several circadian parameters. including peak activity time and robustness of circadian rhythm. but exerted different effects on acrophase in patients with bipolar II depression. In particular. clinical depressive symptoms were associated with robustness of circadian rhythm during the course of the 8-week treatment....,Psychology,Medical,Depression,Depression
4,Actinobacteria are Gram-positive bacteria commonly found in soil. freshwater and marine ecosystems. In this investigation. bias in codon usages of ninety actinobacterial genomes was analyzed by estimating different indices of codon bias such as Nc (effective number of codons). SCUO (synonymous codon usage order). RSCU (relative synonymous codon usage). as well as sequence patterns of codon contexts. The results revealed several characteristic features of codon usage in Actinobacteria. as follows: 1) C- or G-ending codons are used frequently in comparison with A- and U ending codons; 2) there is a direct relationship of GC content with use of specific amino acids such as alanine. proline and glycine; 3) there is an inverse relationship between GC content and Nc estimates. 4) there is low SCUO value (<0.5) for most genes; and 5) GCC-GCC. GCC-GGC. GCC-GAG and CUC-GAC are the frequent context sequences among codons. This study highlights the fact that: 1) in Actinobacteria. extreme GC content and codon bias are driven by mutation rather than natural selection; (2) traits like aerobicity are associated with effective natural selection and therefore low GC content and low codon bias. demonstrating the role of both mutational bias and translational selection in shaping the habitat and phenotype of actinobacterial species.

5,Mirror neurons (MNs) are a fascinating class of cells originally discovered in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and. subsequently. in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) of the macaque. which become active during both the execution and observation of actions. In this review. I will first highlight the mounting evidence indicating that mirroring others' actions engages a broad system of reciprocally connected cortical areas. which extends well beyond the classical IPL-PMv circuit and might even include subcortical regions such as the basal ganglia. Then. I will present the most recent findings supporting the idea that the observation of one's own actions. which might play a role in the ontogenetic origin and tuning of MNs. retains a particular relevance within the adult MN system. Finally. I will propose that both cortical and subcortical mechanisms do exist to decouple MN activity from the motor output. in order to render it exploitable for high-order perceptual. cognitive. and even social functions. The findings reviewed here provide an original framework for envisaging the main challenges and experimental directions of future neurophysiological and neuroanatomical studies of the monkey MN system....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
6,In this paper a new framework is introduced to develop a coupled active and reactive market in distribution networks. Distributed energy resources (DERs) such as synchronous machine-based distributed generations and wind turbines offer their active and reactive powers to the proposed market. For the considered DERs. multicomponent reactive power bidding structures are introduced based on their capability curves. Also. the hourly speed variations of wind turbines are considered in the proposed model. A distribution company buys active and reactive powers from a wholesale market and sells them via this market. The demand side is active. and responsive loads or aggregators can participate in the market using a demand bidding/buyback program. The objective function of the proposed market is to minimize the active and reactive power costs of DERs and distribution companies. the penalty cost of CO2 emission. and the cost of running a demand bidding/buyback program. The effectiveness of the proposed method is examined on a 22-bus 20-kV radial distribution test system....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electrical network
7,A highly reconfigurable merged analog baseband (MABB) with not only tunable bandwidth (BW). gain. and order but also reconfigurable power. noise. and linearity is proposed for multistandard integrated wireless receivers in this brief. The MABB could arrange the total gain to different stages for noise and linearity tradeoffs by introducing the merged biquad topology. To save power. the operational amplifier (Opamp) for the proposed MABB can reduce the GBW. as long as it meets the GBW requirement for different BW. gain. and order. A flexible power-efficient high-GBW Opamp with an adaptive common-mode bias circuit is also proposed for the eighth-order active-RC MABB. The proposed MABB covers a cutoff frequency range from 200 kHz to 20 MHz. whereas the gain could be tuned between 0 and 72 dB. The proposed highly reconfigurable MABB is suitable for multistandard integrated wireless receivers....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing

9,This paper presents different state feedback approaches of finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) applied to a grid-connected voltage-source converter (VSC) with an LCL filter. Besides converter-side current feedback. two multivariable control approaches and line-side current control are introduced and compared based on theoretical and experimental evaluation. As the LCL filter introduces an additional resonance frequency to the system. the use of different active damping (AD) methods in combination with FCS-MPC is discussed. Furthermore. practical control implementation issues are discussed. The presented methods reveal the great potential. high dynamic performance. and flexibility of FCS-MPC. enabling multivariable control as well as both reduced switching losses and low harmonic current distortion at the same time. Eventually. the feasibility of the theoretical control concepts is shown in a laboratory environment....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Control engineering
10,Capacitor current feedback active damping is extensively used in grid-connected converters with an LCL filter. However. systems tends to become unstable when the digital control delay is taken into account. especially in low switching frequencies. This paper discusses this issue by deriving a discrete model with a digital control delay and by presenting the stable region of an active damping loop from high to low switching frequencies. In order to overcome the disadvantage of capacitor current feedback active damping. this paper proposes a modified approach using grid current and converter current for feedback. This can expand the stable region and provide sufficient active damping whether in high or low switching frequencies. By applying the modified approach. the active damping loop can be simplified from fourth-order into second-order. and the design of the grid current loop can be simplified. The modified approach can work well when the grid impedance varies. Both the active damping performance and the dynamic performance of the current loop are verified by simulations and experimental results....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
11,The high-power grid-connected inverters with LCL filters have been widely used. Current control plays a key role in the grid-connected inverter control system. To cope with the inherent resonance of the LCL filter. active damping (AD) methods are usually employed. However. the AD performance is impaired by control delays which are introduced in the digital control implementation process. Besides. the lag phase due to control delays limits the system bandwidth and stability margin. The effects of control delays are more noteworthy in the high-power grid-connected inverter due to its low switching frequency. This paper investigates the current control strategy based on multisampling for the high-power grid-connected inverter with the LCL filter. First. the multisampled AD scheme is studied. which can reduce control delays effectively and improve AD performance. Besides. the multisampled control without additional damping whether passive or active is researched. Through the inverter-side current feedback. the system can realize single-current-loop control based on multisampling. Thus. the control system is simplified and it can be stable. and achieve better dynamic performance. Finally. experimental results show that the proposed control schemes are effective....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Control engineering
12,Resonant poles of LCL filters may challenge the entire system stability especially in digital-controlled pulse width modulation (PWM) inverters. In order to tackle the resonance issues. many active damping solutions have been reported. For instance. a notch filter can be employed to damp the resonance. where the notch frequency should be aligned exactly to the resonant frequency of the LCL filter. However. parameter variations of the LCL filter as well as the time delay appearing in digital control systems will induce resonance drifting. and thus break this alignment. possibly deteriorating the original damping. In this paper. the effectiveness of the notch filter-based active damping is first explored. considering the drifts of the resonant frequency. It is revealed that when the resonant frequency drifts away from its nominal value. the phase lead or lag introduced by the notch filter may make itself fail to damp the resonance. Specifically. the phase lag can make the current control stable despite of the resonant frequency drifting. when the grid current is fed back. In contrast. in the case of an inverter current feedback control. the influence of the phase lead or lag on the active damping is dependent on the actual resonant frequency. Accordingly. in this paper. the notch frequency is designed away from the nominal resonant frequency to tolerate the resonance drifting. being the proposed robust active damping. Simulations and experiments performed on a 2.2-kW three-phase grid-connected PWM inverter verify the effectiveness of the proposed design for robust active damping using digital notch filters....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
13,Control of the LCL-type three-phase grid-connected converter is difficult due to high resonance peak of the LCL filter. Active damping is the state-of-the-art solution to this problem. but the damping performance will be affected by the inherent time delay of digital control. especially for high-power low switching frequency applications. Based on a discrete-time stability analysis of an LCL-type converter with capacitor-current-feedback active damping. a simple and effective time delay compensation method. which is based on area equalization concept. is proposed. The method can reduce the negative impact of the computation delay significantly. It has the potential to serve as a general solution to time delay compensation of a digitally controlled PWM converter. The validity of the proposed method is proved by experimental results....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
14,The wind power generation techniques are continuing to develop and increasing numbers of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind power systems are connecting to the on-shore and off-shore grids. local standalone weak networks. and microgrid applications. The impedances of the weak networks are too large to be neglected and require careful attention. Due to the impedance interaction between the weak network and the DFIG system. both subsynchronous resonance (SSR) and high-frequency resonance (HFR) may occur when the DFIG system is connected to the series or parallel compensated weak network. This paper will discuss the SSR and the HFR phenomena based on the impedance modeling of the DFIG system and the weak networks. and the cause of these two resonances will be explained in details. The following factors will be discussed in this paper: 1) transformer configuration; 2) different power scale of DFIG system with different parameters; 3) L or LCL filter adopted in the grid side converter (GSC); 4) rotor speed; 5) current closed-loop controller parameters; and 6) digital control delay. On the basis of the analysis. active damping strategies for HFR using virtual impedance concept will be proposed....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Electrical network
15,Energy storage systems (ESSs) are generally planned based on the active power. While. reactive power is another important aspect of the ESSs that has not been adequately addressed and discussed. Moreover. ESSs are often managed individually. but coordinated planning on the ESSs and distributed generators (DGs) may result in more suitable outcomes. In order to address these issues. a coordinated ESS and DG planning is presented in this paper. In the proposed planning. the place and capacity of the ESSs and DGs are determined at the same time. The active and reactive powers are included in the planning for both the ESSs and DGs. In other words. the optimal active and reactive capacities are denoted for both the ESSs and DGs on the network. The proposed coordinated ESS and DG planning is carried out on a radial distribution network under deregulated electricity market. Objective function of the proposed planning is to maximize the profit of distribution company (DISCO) subject to the secure operation of the network. The planning is expressed as a nonlinear. mixed integer optimization problem and solved by advanced PSO as a strong Meta-heuristic optimization technique. Simulation results demonstrate the great impacts of the proposed planning on the network. The results demonstrate the priority of the proposed coordinated DG and ESS planning compared to the individual ESS planning. Additionally. it is verified that considering reactive power of the DGs and ESSs changes the results of the planning and provides more realistic and reasonable outputs. The proposed planning significantly increases DISCO profit while guarantees the safe operation of the network through satisfying several security constraints....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electrical network
16,In this paper we present an analysis of the voltage amplifier needed for double differential (DD) sEMG measurements and a novel. very simple circuit for implementing DD active electrodes. The three-input amplifier that standalone DD active electrodes require is inherently different from a differential amplifier. and general knowledge about its design is scarce in the literature. First. the figures of merit of the amplifier are defined through a decomposition of its input signal into three orthogonal modes. This analysis reveals a mode containing EMG crosstalk components that the DD electrode should reject. Then. the effect of finite input impedance is analyzed. Because there are three terminals. minimum bounds for interference rejection ratios due to electrode and input impedance unbalances with two degrees of freedom are obtained. Finally. a novel circuit design is presented. including only a quadruple operational amplifier and a few passive components. This design is nearly as simple as the branched electrode and much simpler than the three instrumentation amplifier design. while providing robust EMG crosstalk rejection and better input impedance using unity gain buffers for each electrode input. The interference rejection limits of this input stage are analyzed. An easily replicable implementation of the proposed circuit is described. together with a parameter design guideline to adjust it to specific needs. The electrode is compared with the established alternatives. and sample sEMG signals are obtained. acquired on different body locations with dry contacts. successfully rejecting interference sources....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Electrical circuits
17,The performance of some Fourier transform based fundamental current detection algorithms is evaluated and compared in this paper. Some difficult conditions are imposed by a load which draws a highly distorted current with a slight fluctuation. i. e. with non-equal semi-periods.

Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) implemented through a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter and respectively the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with Butterfly operation and radix-2 decimation in time (DIT). A digital signal processor (DSP) based solution is used for real-time implementation. namely a dSPACE 1103 controller development board. MATLAB/Simulink software is used for the design of the algorithms because it provides specialized tools and blocks. For the performance comparison one used criteria like total harmonic distortion (THD) and settling time of detected fundamental current and also the run time for the DSP.

18,A high-efficiency. high-power-density buffer architecture is proposed for power pulsation decoupling in power conversion between dc and single-phase ac. We present an active decoupling solution that yields improved efficiency and reduced circuit complexity compared to existing solutions. In the proposed architecture. the main energy storage capacitor is connected in series with an active buffer converter across the dc bus. The series-stacked capacitor blocks the majority of the dc bus voltage to reduce the voltage stress on the buffer converter. such that fast. low-voltage transistors can be employed for the buffer converter. Moreover. the series capacitor provides the majority of the power pulsation decoupling through a wide voltage swing. and the buffer converter only needs to process a small fraction of the total power of the entire architecture. allowing a very small active circuit volume and very high system efficiency. The circuit operation and design constraints are analyzed in detail. In the proposed buffer architecture. the series stacking of a nearly lossless capacitor and a lossy converter presents a challenge of capacitor voltage balancing and power loss compensation. We propose a control scheme exploiting the small ripple in the bus voltage and dc input current to compensate for the power loss in the buffer converter while maintaining the voltage balance. Light-load techniques are also introduced to ensure that the buffer architecture meets strict ripple requirements while providing sufficient loss compensation. A 2-kW hardware prototype based on low-voltage GaN switches has been built to demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution. A power density of 25W/cm(3) (410 W/in(3)) by rectangular box volume and an efficiency above 98.9% across a wide load range has been experimentally verified....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Single-phase electric power

20,Equivalently implementing a generalized memristor by using common components and then making a nonlinear circuit with a reliable property. are conducive to experimentally exhibit the nonlinear phenomena of the memristive chaotic circuit and show practical applications in generating chaotic signals. Firstly. based on a memristive diode bridge circuit. a new first-order actively generalized memristor emulator is constructed with no grounded restriction and ease to realize. The mathematical model of the emulator is established and its fingerprints are analyzed by the pinched hysteresis loops with different sinusoidal voltage stimuli. The results verified by experimental measurements indicate that the emulator uses only one operational amplifier and nine elementary electronic circuit elements and is an active voltage-controlled generalized memristor. Secondly. by parallelly connecting the proposed emulator to a capacitor and then linearly coupling with an RC bridge oscillator. a memristor based chaotic circuit without any inductance element is constructed. The dynamical model of the inductorless memristive chaotic circuit is established and the phase portraits of the chaotic attractor with typical circuit parameters are obtained numerically. The dissipativity. equilibrium points. and stabilities are derived. which indicate that in the phase space of the inductorless memristive chaotic circuit there exists a dissipative area where are distributed two unstable nonzero saddle-foci and a non-dissipative area containing an unstable origin saddle point. Furthermore. by utilizing the bifurcation diagram. Lyapunov exponent spectra. and phase portraits. the dynamical behaviors of the inductorless memristive chaotic circuit are investigated. Results show that with the evolution of the parameter value of the coupling resistor. the complex nonlinear phenomena of the coexisting bifurcation modes and coexisting attractors under two different initial conditions of the state variables can be found in the inductorless memristive chaotic circuit. Finally. a prototype circuit with the same circuit parameters for numerical simulations is developed. from which it can be seen that the prototype circuit has a simple circuit structure and is inexpensive and easy to practically fabricate with common components. Results of both the experimental measurements and the numerical simulations are consistent. verifying the validity of the theoretical analyses....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Electrical circuits

The proposed hybrid column-driver IC drives a mobile UHD (3840 x 2160) AMOLED panel. with one horizontal time of 7.7 mu s at a scan frequency of 60 Hz. simultaneously senses the TFT current for back-end TFT variation compensation.

29,Aims: Activin E is a newly identified member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily. To assess the role of activin E in glucose/energy metabolism. we investigated the transcriptional regulation of activin E in the liver. Main methods: Northern blotting. Western blotting. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used in this study. Key findings: Insulin up-regulated activin E expression at the mRNA and protein level in HepG2 cells. Reporter assays revealed that the putative. functional. promoter sequence of human activin E gene was responsible for the effect of insulin. Mutational analysis of the promoter revealed that CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) play a key role in regulating activin E expression and in the stimulatory effect of insulin on activin E transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the C/EBPs can bind to the activin E promoter in HepG2 cells. The expression of activin E mRNA was up-regulated in the liver of diet-induced obese mice. Significance: These observations suggest that activin E plays a pathophysiological role in glucose metabolism. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

30,Background and purpose: Few studies have examined why some patients with dementia stop attending medical consultations. We conducted a retrospective study to investigate factors associated with discontinuous clinic attendance. Methods: Participants were 988 patients with dementia from university hospital (UH) clinics and affiliated local hospital (LH) clinics. We compared continuous and discontinuous attenders on cognitive and affective functions and activities of daily living (ADL). and also compared UH and LH patients (UH: continuous. n = 176; discontinuous. n = 207; LH: continuous. n = 418; discontinuous. n = 187). Results: The total annual rate of discontinuation was 8.0%. and the mean period of attendance before discontinuation was 2.2 2.4 years (UH. 2.8 +/- 3.0; LH. 1.5 +/- 1.3. P < 0.01).

Abe's behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) score. and ADL were significantly worse in the discontinuous group than the continuous group for both UH and LH patients (P < 0.01). The best predictor of discontinuation was ADL decline (UH and LH) and Abe's BPSD score (UH). The most common reason for discontinuation was returning to the family doctor (39.1% for UH). and cessation of hospital attendance at their own discretion (35.3% for LH). Conclusions: We identified the main reasons for discontinuation of attendance as returning to the family doctor and cessation of hospital attendance at their own discretion. The best predictors of discontinuation were ADL decline and worsening BPSD.

Microgrids are clusters of loads and microsources that operate within a single controllable system. which provides electricity and heat to its local area even if they get separated from the distribution system. Several commercial solutions are addressing this topic using numerous methods; however. to keep the computing time required to solve the system when the size of the system grows represents a major challenge.

This paper also provides the design of a low input voltage (24 V) and variable high output voltage (0-2.5 kV) bidirectional dc-dc flyback converter for driving a capacitive incremental actuator. The incremental actuator consists of three electrically isolated-mechanically connected capacitive actuators. It requires three high-voltage (HV) (2-2.5 kV) bidirectional dc-dc converters to accomplish the incremental motion by charging and discharging the capacitive actuators. The bidirectional flyback converter employs a digital controller to improve the efficiency and charge/discharge speed using the valley switching technique during both charge and discharge processes. without the need to sense signals on the output HV side.

These liver disorders are pre-eclampsia. hemolysis. elevated liver enzymes. low platelet count (HELLP). acute fatty liver. hyperemesis gravidarum. and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. On the other hand. pre-existing autoimmune liver injury of the mother can be affected by pregnancy. This review intends to summarize current knowledge linking feto-maternal immunology and liver inflammation with a special emphasis on novel potential biomarkers....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Myelofibrosis
34,Background: Reporting new cases of enterovirus (EV)-D68-associated acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is essential to understand how the virus causes neurological damage and to characterize EV-D68 strains associated with AFM. Case presentation: A previously healthy 4-year-old boy presented with sudden weakness and limited mobility in his left arm. Two days earlier. he had an upper respiratory illness with mild fever. At admission. his physical examination showed that the child was febrile (38.5 degrees C) and alert but had a stiff neck and weakness in his left arm. which was hypotonic and areflexic. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed a mild increase in white blood cell count (80/mm(3). 41% neutrophils) and a slightly elevated protein concentration (76 gm/dL). Bacterial culture and molecular biology tests for detecting viral infection in CSF were negative. The patient was then treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and acyclovir. Despite therapy. within 24 h. the muscle weakness extended to all four limbs. which exhibited greatly reduced mobility. Due to his worsening clinical prognosis. the child was transferred to our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; at admission he was diagnosed with acute flaccid paralysis of all four limbs. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was negative. except for a focal signal alteration in the dorsal portion of the medulla oblongata. also involving the pontine tegmentum. whereas spine MRI showed an extensive signal alteration of the cervical and dorsal spinal cord reported as myelitis. Signal alteration was mainly localized in the central grey matter. most likely in the anterior horns. Molecular biology tests performed on nasopharyngeal aspirate and on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were negative for bacteria but positive for EV-D68 clade B3. Plasmapheresis was performed and corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulins were administered. After 4 weeks of treatment. the signs and symptoms of AFM were significantly reduced. although some weakness and tingling remained in the patient's four limbs. MRI acquired after 3 weeks showed that the previously reported alterations were no longer present. Conclusion: This case suggests that EV-D68 is a neurotropic agent that can cause AFM and strains are circulating in Europe. EV-D68 disease surveillance is required to better understand EV-D68 pathology and to compare various strains that cause AFM....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Multiple Sclerosis
35,Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) remains a major complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. with a significant proportion of patients failing to respond to first-line systemic corticosteroids. Reliable biomarkers predicting disease severity and response to treatment are warranted to improve its management. Thus. we sought to determine whether pentraxin 3 (PTX3). an acutephase protein produced locally at the site of inflammation. could represent a novel acute GvHD biomarker. Using a murine model of the disease. we found increased PTX3 plasma levels after irradiation and at GvHD onset. Similarly. plasma PTX3 was enhanced in 115 pediatric patients on day of transplantation. likely due to conditioning. and at GvHD onset in patients experiencing clinical symptoms of the disease. PTX3 was also found increased in skin and colon biopsies from patients with active disease. Furthermore. PTX3 plasma levels at GvHD onset were predictive of disease outcome since they resulted significantly higher in both severe and therapyunresponsive patients. Multiple injections of rhPTX3 in the murine model of GvHD did not influence the disease course. Taken together. our results indicate that PTX3 constitutes a biomarker of GvHD severity and therapy response useful to tailor treatment intensity according to early risk-stratification of GvHD patients....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Myelofibrosis
36,Objective and design Cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been widely used in the perioperative period of cancer surgery. which exacerbates the risk of renal injury. In this study. we examined whether dexmedetomidine (DEX). a commonly used anesthetic adjuvant. shows a protective effect against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury. Materials Acute kidney injury in mice was induced by cisplatin. Treatments Mice were administered with DEX 25 mu g/kg or atipamezole 250 mu g/kg (once a day. for 3 days) after cisplatin treatment. Methods The renal function and tubular damage score were evaluated at 72 h following cisplatin administration. Apoptotic tubular cells were detected by TUNEL assay. Caspase-3. p53. Bax. F4/80(+) macrophages. CD3(+) T cells. and NF-kappa B were examined by immunohistochemistry staining or Western blot. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. interleukin (IL)-1 beta. IL-6. and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in kidney were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results DEX treatment preserved renal function and reduced tubular damage score of mice after cisplatin administration. Mice treated with DEX exhibited less apoptotic tubular cells in response to cisplatin insult. which was associated with decreased Bax and reduced activation of p53 and caspase-3. DEX suppressed the infiltration of macrophages and T cells into the kidneys following cisplatin treatment. which was involved in the inhibition of NF-kappa B activation and decreased expression of TNF-alpha. IL-1 beta. IL-6. and MCP-1. Furthermore. we showed that the renoprotective effect conferred by DEX may be related to alpha(2) adrenoceptor-dependent pathway. Conclusion We demonstrate that DEX protects the kidney against cisplatin-induced AKI by the regulation of apoptosis and inflammatory response....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Kidney Health
37,Background: Cell necrosis. oxidative damage. and fibrogenesis are involved in cirrhosis development. a condition in which insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels are diminished. This study evaluates whether the exogenous administration of low doses of IGF-1 can induce hepatoprotection in acute carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver damage compared to healthy controls (Wt Igf(+/+)). Additionally. the impact of IGF-1 deficiency on a damaged liver was investigated in mice with a partial deficit of this hormone (Hz Igf1(+/-)). Methods: Three groups of 25 +/- 5-week-old healthy male mice (Wt Igf(+/+)) were included in the protocol: untreated controls (Wt). Controls that received CCl4 (Wt + CCl4) and Wt + CCl4 were treated subcutaneously with IGF-1 (2 mu g/100 g body weight/day) for 10 days (Wt + CCl4 + IGF1). In parallel. three IGF-1-deficient mice (Hz Igf1(+/-)) groups were studied: untreated Hz. Hz + CCl4. and Hz + CCl4 + IGF-1. Microarray and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses. serum aminotransferases levels. liver histology. and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were assessed at the end of the treatment in all groups. All data represent mean +/- SEM. Results: An altered gene coding expression pattern for proteins of the extracellular matrix. fibrosis. and cellular protection were found. as compared to healthy controls. in which IGF-1 therapy normalized in the series including healthy mice. Liver histology showed that Wt + CCl4 + IGF1 mice had less oxidative damage. fibrosis. lymphocytic infiltrate. and cellular changes when compared to the Wt + CCl4. Moreover. there was a correlation between MDA levels and the histological damage score (Pearson's r = 0.858). In the IGF-1-deficient mice series. similar findings were identified. denoting a much more vulnerable hepatic parenchyma. Conclusions: IGF1 treatment improved the biochemistry. histology. and genetic expression of pro-regenerative and cytoprotective factors in both series (healthy and IGF-1-deficient mice) with acute liver damage. suggesting that low doses of IGF-1. in acute liver damage. could be a feasible therapeutic option....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Myelofibrosis
38,Adenoviruses cause a variety of diseases that range from mild to fatal in vulnerable patients. Its evolution occurs as a process of selection pressure; for example. genetic recombination generates intermediate strains that can be more infectious or pathogenic than parental strains. This study sought to determine the diversity of circulating adenoviruses in Paraguayan children less than 5 years of age hospitalized with acute lower respiratory infection. by using molecular biology and bioinformatics tools. though amplification of penton. hexon and fiber genes in 26 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirates. It was demonstrated the circulation of three species: B (4/26). C (21/26). and D (1/26). as well as recombination events corresponding to the HAdV-D isolate. with at least three different genotypes (D49. D9 y D15). The HAdV-D are associated with gastrointestinal or ocular diseases. and less commonly with respiratory infections. Recently. however. it has been reported changes in behavior of these viruses due to recombination. allowing them to expand their host cell repertoire. These data extend the knowledge about the genetic diversity of HAdV in Paraguay and strongly support the importance of genomic analysis using bioinformatics tools in epidemiological surveillance of emerging recombinant strains of HAdV....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,HIV/AIDS
39,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children. While survival rates for ALL have improved. central nervous system (CNS) relapse remains a significant cause of treatment failure and treatment-related morbidity. Accordingly. there is a need to identify more efficacious and less toxic CNS-directed leukemia therapies. Extensive research has demonstrated a critical role of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in leukemia development. maintenance. and chemoresistance. Moreover. therapies to disrupt mechanisms of BM microenvironment-mediated leukemia survival and chemoresistance represent new. promising approaches to cancer therapy. However. in direct contrast to the extensive knowledge of the BM microenvironment. the unique attributes of the CNS microenvironment that serve to make it a leukemia reservoir are not yet elucidated. Recent work has begun to define both the mechanisms by which leukemia cells migrate into the CNS and how components of the CNS influence leukemia biology to enhance survival. chemoresistance. and ultimately relapse. In addition to providing new insight into CNS relapse and leukemia biology. this area of investigation will potentially identify targetable mechanisms of leukemia chemoresistance and self-renewal unique to the CNS environment that will enhance both the durability and quality of the cure for ALL patients....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
40,RNA-sequencing of the patient's bone marrow detected fusion transcripts in which the coding sequence of the FAM53B gene (from 10q26) was fused to a genomic sequence (from 19q13) that mapped upstream of the SLC7A10 locus. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction together with Sanger sequencing verified the presence of this fusion transcript. The FAM53B fusion transcript is not expected to produce any chimeric protein. However. it may code for a truncated FAM53B protein consisting of the first 302 amino acids of FAM53B together with amino acids from the 19q13 sequence. Functionally. the truncated FAM53B would be similar to the protein encoded by the FAM53B sequence with accession no. BC031654.1 (FAM53B protein accession no. AAH31654.1). Furthermore. the truncated protein contains the entire conserved domain of the FAM53 protein family. The chromosome aberration t(10;19)(q26;q13) detected in this study was previously reported in a single case of ALL. in which it was also the sole karyotypic change. Both patients entered complete hematological and cytogenetic remission following treatment....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Myelofibrosis
41,Purpose ETV6/RUNX1(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). which is the most common genetic subtype of pediatric ALL. has a favorable prognosis. In this study. we analyzed the outcome of ETV6/RUNX1 (+) ALL patients treated at our institution with the aim of identifying significant prognostic variables. Materials and Methods Sixty-three patients were diagnosed with ETV6/RUNX1(+) ALL from 2005 to 2011. Prognostic variables studied included minimal residual disease (MRD) as detected by ETI/6/RUNX1(+) fusion. and the presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Results The 5-year event-free survival was 84.1 +/- 4.6%. with 10 patients relapsing at a median of 28.3 months from diagnosis for a 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse of 15.9 4.6%. Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence MRD. as detected by real-time quantitative-polymerase chain reaction or fluorescence in situ hybridization for ETV6/RUNX1 fusion at end of remission induction. and the presence of additional structural abnormalities of 12p (translocations or inversions) negatively affected outcome. Despite treatment such as allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. eight of the 10 relapsed patients died from disease progression for overall survival of 82.5 +/- 6.9%. Conclusion ETV6/RUNX1(+) ALL may be heterogeneous in terms of prognosis. and variables such as MRD at end of remission induction or additional structural abnormalities of 12p could define a subset of patients who are likely to have poor outcome....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
42,IntroductionThe translocation t(12;21)(p13;q22) resulting in the fusion gene ETV6-RUNX1. is the most frequent gene fusion in childhood B lymphoblastic leukemia. In the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL-2008 treatment protocol. treatment stratification in B-lineage ALL is based on results of minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). In this study. we determined whether RT-qPCR of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion transcript can be a reliable alternative for MRD analysis. MethodsSeventy-eight bone marrow samples from 29 children at diagnosis and day 15. 29. and 78 during treatment were analyzed for MRD with FACS and with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Fusion transcript MRD was defined as the ETV6-RUNX1/GUSB ratio at the follow-up time point (day 15/29/78) divided with the ETV6-RUNX1/GUSB ratio at diagnosis (%). ResultsMRD analysis with FACS and with RT-qPCR of ETV6-RUNX1 fusion transcript showed strong correlation. All cases showed concordant results at the treatment stratifying time points day 29 and day 78. when comparing the two methods with a cutoff set to 0.1%. ConclusionRT-qPCR is a valuable addition and could also be an alternative to FACS in cases where FACS is not achievable for MRD analysis....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Myelofibrosis
43,Glucocorticoids (GCs) induce apoptosis in lymphoid lineage cells and are therefore used in the therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and related malignancies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and the related mirtrons are similar to 22 nucleotide RNAs derived from polymerase-II transcripts and implicated in the control of essential biological functions. including apoptosis. Whether GCs regulate miRNA-encoding transcription units is unknown. We investigated miRNA/mirtron expression and GC regulation in 8 leukemia/lymphoma in vitro models and 13 ALL children undergoing systemic GC monotherapy using a combination of expression profiling techniques. real time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and northern blotting to detect mature miRNAs and/or their precursors. We found that mature miRNA regulations can be inferred from expression data of their host genes. Although a simple miRNA-initiated canonical pathway to GC-induced apoptosis or cell cycle arrest did not emerge. we identified several miRNAs/mirtrons that were regulated by GC in patients and cell lines. including the myeloid-specific miR-223 and the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest-inducing miR15 similar to 16 clusters. In an in vitro model. overexpression of miR15b similar to 16 mimics increased and silencing by miR15b similar to 16 inhibitors decreased GC sensitivity. Thus. the observed complex changes in miRNA/mirtron expression during GC treatment might contribute to the anti-leukemic GC effects in a cell context-dependent manner....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Diabetes
44,Treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) over the past four decades remains mostly unchanged and the prognosis for the majority of patients remains poor. Most of the significant advances that have been observed are in defining cytogenetic abnormalities. as well as the genetic and epigenetic profiles of AML patients. While new cytogenetic and genetic aberrations such as the FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations are able to guide prognosis for the majority of patients with AML. outcomes are still dismal and relapse rates remain high. It is thought that relapse in AML is in part driven by minimal residual disease (MRD) that remains in the patient following treatment. Thus. there is a need for sensitive and objective methodology for MRD detection. Methodologies such as multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC). quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). digital PCR (dPCR). or next-generation sequencing (NGS) are being employed to evaluate their utility in MRD assessment. In this review. we will provide an overview of AML and the clinical utility of MRD measurement. We will discuss optimal timing to MRD measurement. the different approaches that are available. and efforts in the standardization across laboratories....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
45,The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has recently been implicated in leukaemic cell growth. tumour-associated angiogenesis and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We examined whether mTOR plays a role as regulator of growth and VEGF-expression in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Three mTOR-targeting drugs. rapamycin. everolimus (RAD001) and CCI-779. were applied. The effects of these drugs on growth. survival. apoptosis and VEGF expression in primary AML cells and various AML cell lines were examined. Growth of AML cells and AML-derived cell lines was assessed by (3)H-thymidine incorporation. survival was examined by light- and electron microscopy. by Tunel assay and by AnnexinV-staining. and the expression of VEGF by Northern blotting. RT-PCR and ELISA. Rapamycin was found to counteract growth in the AML cell lines U937 and KG1a as well as in primary AML cells in 14/18 patients examined. The effects of rapamycin and its derivatives were dose-dependent (IC(50): 10 pM-100 nM). It was also found that exposure to mTOR-targeting drugs resulted in apoptosis and in decreased expression of VEGF in leukaemic cells. mTOR-targeting drugs exert antileukaemic effects on AML cells in vitro through multiple actions. including direct inhibition of proliferation. induction of apoptosis and suppression of VEGF. Based on this study and other studies. mTOR can be regarded as a potential drug target in AML....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Cancer
46,Background/Purpose: Mutations in the tet oncogene family member 2 gene (TET2) are frequently found in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Reports of TET2 mutations in children are limited. We assessed the prevalence of TET2 mutations in Taiwanese children with AML and analyzed their prognosis. Methods: Between 1997 and 2010. a total of 69 consecutive children with AML were enrolled at the National Taiwan University Hospital. The analysis for TET2 mutations was performed using direct sequencing. Clinical characteristics and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients with and without TET2 alterations. Results: Intronic and missense mutations were identified. No nonsense or frameshift mutations were observed. Two putative disease-causing missense mutations (S609C and A1865G) were identified in one patient. We estimated the prevalence of TET2 mutations in the current patient population to be 1.4%. The most common polymorphism was I1762V (45%). followed by V218M (12%). P29R (6%). and F868L (6%). Patients with polymorphism I1762V had an increased 10-year survival rate compared with patients without I1762V (48.4% vs. 25.7%. p = 0.049) by Chi-square test; OS was not different when examined using the Kaplan-Meier method (p = 0.104). Conclusion: The prevalence of TET2 mutations in children with AML compared with adults with AML was lower and less complex. Patient prognosis associated with TET2 mutations in children requires further investigation. Copyright (C) 2015. Formosan Medical Association.

47,Several studies have reported previously that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may express WT1 detected by RT-PCR and/or Northern blotting. The diagnostic utility of WT1 expression in AML using immunohistochemistry has not been reported previously. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 55 AML. 12 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). and 10 normal bone marrow specimens were immunostained for WT1 (anti-N terminus antibody). 22/55 AML cases (40%) demonstrated nuclear immunopositivity for WT1. including 20/47 bone marrow trephines and 2/4 granulocytic sarcomas. All the ALL and normal bone marrow specimens were negative. A significant proportion of AML expresses nuclear immunostaining for WT1. a finding that has only been described previously in Wilms' tumor and desmoplastic small round cell tumor. This finding is important for the correct interpretation of immunohistochemical findings in the diagnosis of "small round cell'' tumors of childhood. especially in cases of extramedullary deposits of AML. in which traditional myeloid markers may be negative....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Cancer
48,The karyotype is critical for the evaluation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at diagnosis. Cytogenetic abnormalities detected in AML are one of the most powerful independent prognostic factors. It impacts on the choice of treatment in clinical trials. All chromosomes can be targeted. common chromosomal abnormalities are recurrent and may be associated with a cytological well-defined type. In 40% of the cases. the karyotype is normal and must be associated with molecular biology studies that can refine the prognosis. The usefulness of the karyotype is more limited during the follow-up of the patient due to its limited sensitivity. but it is still useful in the clinical management of relapse. Since 2001. the WHO (World Health Organization) classification of hematological malignancies integrates cytogenetic data in the classification of AML. Karyotype is therefore mandatory in the diagnosis of AML....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Cancer
49,Purpose: To correlate visual acuity outcomes and clinical features with quantitative PCR DNA copy number in patients with acute retinal necrosis (ARN). Methods: Retrospective. consecutive case series. Results: In total. 14 eyes of 13 patients were diagnosed with ARN. based on the American Uveitis Society criteria. and were followed for a mean of 324.5 days (median 250.5 days. SD +/- 214 days). Anterior chamber fluid analyzed by quantitative PCR identified viral DNA in 11 of 14 eyes (78.5%). Varicella zoster virus (VZV) was identified in seven eyes (50%) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) in four eyes (28.5%). Mean DNA copy number was 7.9 x 10(6)/mL (median 2.10 x 10(6)/mL. range: 0-5.60 x 10(7)/mL). Eyes with quantitative PCR DNA copy number of 5.0 x 10(6)/mL (n = 6 eyes) had worse baseline visual acuity (logMAR 1.48 +/- 0.71 vs 0.94 +/- 0.76. p = 0.196) and final visual acuity (logMAR 2.10 +/- 0.60 vs 0.82 +/- 0.81. p = 0.007) compared with patients with a DNA copy number <5.0 x 10(6)/mL (n = 8 eyes). Patients with a DNA copy number of 5.0 x 10(6)/mL were more likely to have at least 5 clock hours of retinitis on funduscopic exam (p = 0.03) and developed retinal detachment more frequently (p = 0.08). Conclusions: Quantitative DNA copy number of 5.0 x 10(6)/mL is associated with more extensive retinitis. worse visual acuity. and development of retinal detachment in patients with acute retinal necrosis....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Polycythemia Vera
50,This review summarizes present evidence for the role of YKL-40 in the diagnosis. prognosis and cause of cardiovascular and alcoholic liver disease. The question of whether YKL-40 is merely a marker or a causal factor in the development of cardiovascular and liver disease is addressed. with emphasis on the Mendelian randomization design. The Mendelian randomization approach uses genetic variants associated with lifelong high plasma YKL-40 levels that are largely unconfounded and not prone to reverse causation. Thus. the approach mimics a controlled double-blind randomized trial. but it uses genetic variants rather than a drug and placebo. and like a blinded trial. it allows inference about causality. Moreover. the review also covers background on the molecular biology and functions of YKL-40. YKL-40 levels in healthy individuals and reference range. and the role of YKL-40 as a biomarker of cardiovascular and alcoholic liver disease. YKL-40 is a plasma protein named after its three N-terminal amino acids. Y (tyrosine). K (lysine) and L (leucine). and its molecular weight of 40kDa. It is produced by local inflammatory cells in inflamed tissues. such as lipid-laden macrophages inside the vessel wall and perhaps also hepatic stellate cells. Observational studies show that plasma YKL-40 levels are elevated in patients with cardiovascular and liver disease and are associated with disease severity and prognosis. Furthermore. elevated plasma YKL-40 levels in apparently healthy individuals are associated with a 2-fold increased risk of future ischemic stroke and venous thromboembolism. but not with myocardial infarction. suggesting that YKL-40 could play a role in the formation of embolisms rather than atherosclerosis per se. Further. elevated YKL-40 levels combined with excessive alcohol consumption are associated with 10-years risk of alcoholic liver cirrhosis of up to 7%. suggesting that YKL-40 can be used as a strong noninvasive marker of predicting alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Importantly. in Mendelian randomization studies. genetically elevated plasma YKL-40 levels were not associated with risk of cardiovascular and alcoholic liver disease. thus suggesting that plasma YKL-40 does not play a causal role in the development of these diseases. Despite this. plasma YKL-40 levels may play a role in disease progression after diagnosis. and inhibition of YKL-40 activity might be a novel therapy in some cardiovascular and liver diseases....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Heart Disease
51,Acyclovir resistance is rarely seen in herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I encephalitis. Prevalence rates vary between 0.5 % in immunocompetent patients (Christophers et al. 1998; Fife et al. 1994) and 3.5-10 % in immunocompromised patients (Stranska et al. 2005). We report a 45-year-old. immunocompetent (negative HIV antigen/antibody testing). female patient. without previous illness who developed-after a febrile prodromal stage-aphasia and psychomotor slowing. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) showed right temporal and insular T2-hyperintense lesions with spreading to the contralateral temporal lobe. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis yielded lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein level. Polymerase chain reaction testing for HSV type I showed a positive result in repeat lumbar puncture. HSV type I encephalitis was diagnosed and intravenous acyclovir treatment was initiated (750 mg t.i.d.). Acyclovir treatment was intensified to 1000 mg t.i.d.. due to clinical deterioration. ongoing pleocytosis and progression on cMRI 5 days after initiation of antiviral therapy. In parallel. acyclovir resistance testing showed mutation of thymidine kinase gene at position A156V prompting foscarnet therapy (60 mg t.i.d.). Patient's condition improved dramatically over 2 weeks. Acyclovir resistance is rare but should be considered in case of clinical worsening of patient's condition. To our knowledge. this is the first report of acyclovir resistance in HSV type I encephalitis of an immunocompetent and previously healthy patient in Austria....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,HIV/AIDS
52,Introduction: The recent approval of adalimumab (trade name Humira. Abbvie inc.) by the FDA for the treatment of noninfectious intermediate. posterior and panuveitis marks the first on label' non-corticosteroid drug available to ophthalmologists. Immunomodulatory (IMT) and biologic agents have long been shown to be effective in inducing remission of chronic uveitis but have remained as orphan drugs due to lack of financial incentive and perceived need. Areas covered: Here we provide detail into the background and use of adalimumab for uveitic patients. Topics include pharmacology. therapeutic indications and usage. dosage. drug safety. physician monitoring. side effects and adverse events. Expert opinion: We see the approval of adalimumab for uveitis as an important milestone improving upon the accepted standards of care for patients with this severe. sight threatening disease. We implore medical professionals to consider the use of IMT and biologic treatments for patients with recurrent non-infectious uveitis. referring to ocular immunology and uveitis specialists when necessary....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Rheumatoid Arthritis
53,Aims: Trophoblast fusion in the placenta is prerequisite to successful pregnancy and the pathological conditions related to it. The presence of syncytin-1. is not sufficient to explain the complete event and ADAM12 is a major co-player candidate. Via differential splicing. the ADAM12 gene produces a short and a long form. being the ADAM12-S and the ADAM12-L respectively. Methods and results: We investigated the localisation of both variants in the human placenta using whole mount in situ hybridisation. immunohistochemistry and Northern blotting in 1st (n = 8) and 3rd (n = 8) trimester placentae and in the case of NB in several cell lines. In Northern blotting. 1st and 3rd trimester placentae were positive for the ADAM12-S and Bewo. 293HEK. JAR. leucocytes. macrophages. 1st and 3rd trimester placentae were positive for ADAM12-L. In whole mount in situ hybridisation. the 1st and 3rd trimester placental syncytium was positive for both variants. In immunohistochemistry. ADAM12-L localised in the cytotrophoblast of both 1st and 3rd trimester placentae. while ADAM12-S localised in the complete syncytium. often including the cytotrophoblast. Conclusion: The different localisation of ADAM12-S and ADAM12-L indicates a possible different role making ADAM12-L a candidate for the fusion event. while the syncytial localisation of the ADAM12-S makes it a candidate for cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions between the placental syncytium and the maternal interface.

54,This paper proposes an adaptive controller with an improved high-frequency injection method for sensorless synchronous reluctance drive systems. A mathematical model is presented to show that the use of a high-frequency injection method that takes into account the effects of unequal mutual-inductances and the influence of speed reduces the rotor position estimation error. The adaptive speed control algorithm offers improved transient performance in comparison to typical proportional-integral (PI) controllers that are employed in sensorless drive systems. To demonstrate the viability. the proposed adaptive controller and the modified high-frequency injection method are implemented using a TMS-320F-28335A digital signal processor to control a 500 W prototype synchronous reluctance motor drive. Experimental results are presented to show that the transient. load disturbance. and tracking responses of the proposed drive system are superior in comparison to a drive that uses a PI controller. Both experimental and theoretical analyses clearly indicate that the proposed high-frequency injection method with an adaptive speed-loop controller offers improved performance in adjustable speed synchronous reluctance drive systems....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
55,In this paper. a current sensorless adaptive secondary-side control is proposed for the series resonant converter (SRC). making it a good candidate for MHz 48 voltage regulators. By means of varying ac equivalent resistance. the output voltage regulation is achieved by controlling the duty cycle of the synchronous MOSFET. By taking advantage of the secondary-side control. SRCs can operate under zero-voltage switching at any input voltage and load conditions. A current sensorless adaptive digital control is proposed to control the current-type synchronous MOSFETs. which automatically compensates the delay caused by the current-sensor circuit and the gate driver. and also eliminates the current sensor in the power path. A hybrid control strategy is introduced to overcome the efficiency degradation caused by the secondary-side control....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
56,A recursive smoothing filter employing a bank of fading-memory polynomial sub-filters is presented. Variance estimates are used to mix the outputs of the sub-filters. imparting variable gain and phase characteristics that permit it to automatically adapt to signal parameter changes. The proposed adaptive technique does not involve the estimation of plant parameters; therefore. it may be used in both open-loop and closed-loop configurations. In open-loop estimation problems. variable gain/bandwidth allows it to reduce the impact of random errors caused by sensor noise and the impact of bias errors caused by model mismatch during ` maneuvers'. In feedback control problems. variable phase/delay allows it to act as a lag filter for an improved steady-state response (i.e. greater noise attenuation) and act as a lead filter. or a proportionalderivative controller. for an improved transient response (i.e. increased closed-loop damping) for input discontinuities.

57,In this paper. a novel mixed iterative adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm is developed to solve the optimal battery energy management and control problem in smart residential microgrid systems. Based on the data of the load and electricity rate. two iterations are constructed. which are P-iteration and V-iteration. respectively. The V-iteration is implemented based on value iteration. which aims to obtain the iterative control law sequence in each period. The P-iteration is implemented based on policy iteration. which updates the iterative value function according to the iterative control law sequence. Properties of the developed mixed iterative ADP algorithm are analyzed. It is shown that the iterative value function is monotonically nonincreasing and converges to the solution of the Bellman equation. In each iteration. it is proven that the performance index function is finite under the iterative control law sequence. Finally. numerical results and comparisons are given to illustrate the performance of the developed algorithm....,ECE,ECE,Electricity,Electricity
58,This paper proposes a dimmable energy-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) driver for applications in interior lighting. High efficiency is achieved by an adaptive voltage regulation. which minimizes power losses in the linear current regulator. A digital control mechanism employing a resistive digital-to-analog converter for feeding the analog feedback input of a dc-dc converter is introduced. It is shown that the digital control methodology gives maximum design flexibility and enhances control over regulation speed and stability. In an experimental setup. the proposed concept is verified and evaluated. Operating at an input voltage of 24 V. the LED driver provides a relatively wide output voltage range of 3.5-38 V. Output current is regulated to 700 mA with a steady-state precision of more than 98.8%. whereas pulsewidth modulation dimming with a frequency of 1 kHz and shortest on-time of 4 mu s is employed. A peak efficiency of the complete system of 93.9% is achieved....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
59,Environmental governance systems are under greater pressure to adapt and to cope with increased social and ecological uncertainty from stressors like climate change. We review principles of social cognition and decision making that shape and constrain how environmental governance systems adapt. We focus primarily on the interplay between key decision makers in society and legal systems. We argue that adaptive governance must overcome three cooperative dilemmas to facilitate adaptation: (1) encouraging collaborative problem solving. (2) garnering social acceptance and commitment. and (3) cultivating a culture of trust and tolerance for change and uncertainty. However. to do so governance systems must cope with biases in people's decision making that cloud their judgment and create conflict. These systems must also satisfy people's fundamental needs for self-determination. fairness. and security. ensuring that changes to environmental governance are perceived as legitimate. trustworthy. and acceptable. We discuss the implications of these principles for common governance solutions (e.g.. public participation. enforcement) and conclude with methodological recommendations. We outline how scholars can investigate the social cognitive principles involved in cases of adaptive governance....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
60,Adjuvants are substances added to vaccines to improve their immunogenicity. Used for more than 80years. aluminum. the first adjuvant in human vaccines. proved insufficient to develop vaccines that could protect against new challenging pathogens such as HIV and malaria. New adjuvants and new combinations of adjuvants (Adjuvant Systems) have opened the door to the delivery of improved and new vaccines against re-emerging and difficult pathogens. Adjuvant Systems concept started through serendipity. The access to new developments in technology. microbiology and immunology have been instrumental for the dicephering of what they do and how they do it. This knowledge opens the door to more rational vaccine design with implications for developing new and better vaccines....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,HIV/AIDS
61,In recent years. immunotherapy has gained renewed interest as an alternative therapeutic approach for solid tumors. Its premise is based on harnessing the power of the host immune system to destroy tumor cells. Development of immune-mediated therapies. such as vaccines. adoptive transfer of autologous immune cells. and stimulation of host immunity by targeting tumor-evasive mechanisms have advanced cancer immunotherapy. In addition. studies on innate immunity and mechanisms of immune evasion have enhanced our understanding on the immunology of liver cancer. Preclinical and clinical studies with immune-mediated therapies have shown potential benefits in patients with liver cancer. In this review. we summarize current knowledge and recent developments in tumor immunology by focusing on two main primary liver cancers: hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Cancer
62,Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are thought to be predominant proteases and protease inhibitors involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) through their ability to remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) in response to inflammatory stimuli and by their immunomodulating effects. An imbalance between MMPs and TIMPs has been linked with acute and chronic inflammation and aberrant tissue remodeling. as seen in IBD. Moreover. recurrent phases of tissue destruction and subsequent tissue repair can cause serious complications in IBD patients such as fistulas and fibrosis. The aims of this review are (i) to summarize current literature on genetic association. mRNA. and protein expression studies with regard to MMPs and TIMPs in IBD patients and various animal models. including those with transgenic and knockout mice; (ii) to compare biochemical and molecular biological data in humans with those obtained in animal model studies and (iii) to critically evaluate and translate how this knowledge may be used in practical terms to understand better the pathophysiology and mechanisms operating in IBD and to apply this for improvement of clinical outcomes at diagnostic. prognostic and therapeutic levels....,biochemistry,Medical,Molecular biology,Irritable Bowel Syndrome
63,CRISPR-Cas are self-/nonself-discriminating systems found in prokaryotic cells. They represent a remarkable example of molecular memory that is hereditarily transmitted. Their discovery can be considered as one of the first fruits of the systematic exploration of prokaryotic genomes. Although this genomic feature was serendipitously discovered in molecular biology studies. it was the availability of multiple complete genomes that shed light about their role as a genetic immune system. Here we tell the story of how this discovery originated and was slowly and painstakingly advanced to the point of understating the biological role of what initially was just an odd genomic feature....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Molecular biology,Genetics
64,In this chapter has been proposed a robust sensorless cascade control scheme for a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) drive. A Discrete Time Variable Structure Control (DTVSC) is considered and the rotor position and speed are obtained through an Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF). The performance of the filter is improved by an on line adjustment of the input and measurement noise covariances obtained by a suitably defined estimation algorithm. The proposed solution is experimentally tested on a commercial PMSM drive equipped with a control system based on a floating point Digital Signal Processor (DSP)....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
65,This paper presents a power system harmonic elimination using the mixed adaptive linear neural network and variable step-size leaky least mean square (ADALINE-VSSLLMS) control algorithm based active power filter (APF). The weight vector of ADALINE along with the variable step-size parameter and leakage coefficient of the VSSLLMS algorithm are automatically adjusted to eliminate harmonics from the distorted load current. For all iteration. the VSSLLMS algorithm selects a new rate of convergence for searching and runs the computations. The adopted shunt-hybrid APF (SHAPF) consists of an APF and a series of 7th tuned passive filter connected to each phase. The performance of the proposed ADALINE-VSSLLMS control algorithm employed for SHAPF is analyzed through a simulation in a MATLAB/Simulink environment. Experimental results of a real-time prototype validate the efficacy of the proposed control algorithm....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Single-phase electric power
66,The proposed frequency-locked loop (FLL) utilizes the flat frequency response characteristics of the moving window filter (MWF) in closed-loop and adaptive sampling pulse adjustment for capacitance measurement. An operational amplifier (op-amp) based relaxation oscillator generates a square wave whose fundamental sine wave is extracted by MWF. Then. the fundamental sine wave is tracked by the FLL to estimate its frequency which is inversely proportional to the unknown capacitance. The FLL employs another MWF to track the center frequency and its variation due to capacitance. The MWF offers an almost flat frequency response around the center frequency in closed-loop. However. the small magnitude and phase errors observed in the flat frequency response had been corrected by adjusting the sampling pulses adaptively. Experimental investigation demonstrates the capabilities of the scheme for wider and accurate capacitance measurement....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing

68,In comparison with conventional operational amplifier. ring amplifier can achieve better power efficiency for switched capacitor circuits. However. the cascade-inverter architecture of ring amplifier may suffer from undesirable oscillation which has a great impact on transient stability. This paper presents a latched-based ring amplifier which is capable of decreasing the probability of oscillation. Besides. two auto-zero schemes are employed in different pipelined stages to reduce the common-mode voltage offset and to increase the stability. The prototype ADC was fabricated in a 90-nm CMOS technology. The measured SNDR and SFDR are 52.06 dB and 63.15 dB. respectively. for a Nyquist frequency input sampled at 35 MS/s. and the ADC consumes 3.65 mW....,ECE,ECE,Operational amplifier,Analog signal processing
69,Background/Aims: The organization of actin cytoskeleton in podocyte foot processes plays a critical role in the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. The cAMP pathway is an important regulator of the actin network assembly in cells. However. the role of the cAMP pathway in podocytes is not well understood. Type 1 adenylate cyclase (Adcy1). previously thought to be specific for neuronal tissue. is a member of the family of enzymes that catalyses the formation of cAMP. In this study. we characterized the expression and role of Adcy1 in the kidney. Methods: Expression of Adcy1 was studied by RT-PCR. Northern blotting and in situ hybridization. The role of Adcy1 in podocytes was investigated by analyzing Adcy1 knockout mice (Adcy1-/-). Results and Conclusion: Adcy1 is expressed in the kidney specifically by podocytes. In the kidney. Adcy1 does not have a critical role in normal physiological functioning as kidney histology and function are normal in Adcy1-/-mice. However. albumin overload resulted in severe albuminuria in Adcy1-/-mice. whereas wild-type control mice showed only mild albumin leakage to urine. In conclusion. we have identified Adcy1 as a novel podocyte signaling protein that seems to have a role in compensatory physiological processes in the glomerulus. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG.

70,The endogenous oxytocin system plays a vital role in facilitating parturition. lactation and social interaction in humans and other mammals. It also impacts on a number of important endocrine. immune and neurotransmitter systems. A well-regulated oxytocin system has been proposed to increase resilience. and therefore reduce the likelihood of an individual developing mental illness or substance dependence. This review discusses the adverse external influences that can modulate oxytocin receptor and protein levels and impact on substance use and mental health. The paper highlights the impact of adversity such as poor maternal care. parental substance use and child abuse or neglect. We review clinical and preclinical data on the impact of adversity on the basis of the time of exposure from infancy and early childhood. to adolescence. adulthood to older age. Previous research suggests that dysregulation of the endogenous oxytocin system may be implicated in determining susceptibility to stress. anxiety. addiction and mental health conditions. The impact of external influence seems to be strongest in specific time periods where the system shows experience-based development or natural fluctuations in oxytocin levels. Interventions that target the oxytocin system during or soon after exposure to adversity may prove protective. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health. Inc.

71,Background and aims Deficits in social cognitive abilities including emotion recognition and theory of mind (ToM) can play a significant role in interpersonal difficulties observed in alcohol use disorder (AUD). This meta-analysis aims to estimate mean effect sizes of deficits in social cognition inAUD and examines the effects of demographic and clinical confounding factors on the variability of effect sizes across studies. Methods A literature review was conducted on research reports published from January 1990 to January 2016. Twenty-five studies investigating ToM and facial emotion recognition performances of 756 individuals with AUD and 681 healthy controls were selected after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Weighted effect sizes (d) were calculated for ToM. decoding and reasoning aspects of ToM. total facial emotion recognition and recognition of each of six basic emotions. Results Facial emotion recognition was significantly impaired [d=0.65.95% confidence interval (CI)=0.42-0.89]. particularly for disgust and anger. AUDwas also associated with deficits in ToM (d=0.58. 95% CI=0.36-0.81). These deficits were evident in tasks measuring both decoding (d=0.46. 95% CI=0.19-0.73) and reasoning (d=0.72. 95% CI=0.37-1.06) aspects of ToM. The longer duration of alcohol misuse and more depressive symptoms were associated with more severe deficits in recognition of facial emotions. Conclusions Alcohol use disorder appears to be associated with significant impairment in facial emotion recognition and theory of mind....,Psychology,Psychology,Social cognition,Social cognition
72,Aims To investigate whether: (1) childmaltreatment is associated with life-time cannabis use. early-onset cannabis use. daily cannabis use and DSM-IV cannabis abuse in young adulthood; and (2) behaviour problems. tobacco use and alcohol use at age 14 are associated with cannabis use. Design Birth cohort using linked government agency child protection data to define exposure to child maltreatment. Setting The Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy in Brisbane. Australia. Participants Of the original cohort of 7223 mother and child pairs. obtained from consecutive presentations for prenatal care at a hospital serving a cross-section of the community. 3778 (52.3%) of the young people participated at age 21 years. Measurements Exposure to child maltreatment was established by substantiated government agency reports. Cannabis outcomes were by self-report questionnaire and Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)-Auto at age 21. Associations were adjusted for a range of potential confounders. Additional adjustment was carried out for variables measured at age 14-youth behaviour problems [Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)]. tobacco use and alcohol use. Findings After adjustment. substantiated child maltreatment was associated with any life-time cannabis use [odds ratio (OR) = 1.60. 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08-2.39]. cannabis use prior to age 17 (OR = 2.47. 95 % CI = 1.67-3.65). daily cannabis use (OR = 2.68. 95% CI = 1.49-4.81) and DSM-IV cannabis abuse/dependence (OR = 1.72. 95% CI = 1.07-2.77). Externalizing behaviour and tobacco and alcohol use at age 14 were associated significantly with almost all cannabis outcomes (P < 0.05). with internalizing behaviour associated inversely (P < 0.05). Conclusions Children in Australia who are documented as having been maltreated are more likely to go on to use cannabis before the age of 17. use cannabis as an adult. use cannabis daily and meet DSM-IV criteria for cannabis dependence. Externalizing behaviour in adolescence appears partly to mediate the association with adult cannabis use....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
73,The purpose of this project was to examine the emotional health and wellbeing of Canadian caregivers of persons with significant mental health or addictions problems. We assessed the emotional health of caregivers by care-receiver condition type (i.e. mental health or addictions vs. physical or other health problems). levels of caregiver stress and methods particularly for reducing stress among caregivers of persons with mental health or addictions disorders. Weighted cross-sectional data from the 2012 General Social Survey (Caregiving and Care Receiving) were modelled using weighted descriptive and logistic regression analyses to examine levels of stress and the emotional health and well-being of caregivers by care-receiver condition type. Caregivers of persons with mental health or addictions problems were more likely to report that caregiving was very stressful and that they felt depressed. tired. worried or anxious. overwhelmed; lonely or isolated; short-tempered or irritable; and resentful because of their caregiving responsibilities. The results of this study suggest that mental health and addictions caregivers may experience disparate stressors and require varying services and supports relative to caregivers of persons with physical or other health conditions....,Psychology,Psychology,Depression,Depression
74,Defined as sexually explicit material that elicits erotic thoughts. feelings. and behaviours. internet pornography is a prevalent form of media that may facilitate problematic use and craving for engagement. Research suggests that superordinate cognitions and information processing. such as desire thinking and metacognition. are central to the activation and escalation of craving in addictive behaviours. The current study aimed to contribute to the literature by testing the proposed metacognitive model of desire thinking and craving in a sample of problematic pornography users. while revising the model by incorporating negative affect. From a theoretical perspective. environmental cues trigger positive metacognitions about desire thinking that directly influence desire thinking. resulting in the escalation of craving. negative metacognitions. and negative affect. Participants were recruited via an online survey and screened for problematic internet pornography use. Path analyses were used to investigate relationships among the aforementioned constructs in a final sample of 191 participants. Consistent with previous research. results of this study validated the existence of metacognitive processes in the activation of desire thinking and escalation of craving. while indicating that desire thinking has the potential to influence negative affect. Additionally. results supported the role of significant indirect relationships between constructs within the revised model of metacognition. desire thinking. and psychopathology. Collectively. the findings demonstrate the clinical value of a metacognitive conceptualisation of problematic pornography use. Exploring the metacognitive mechanisms that underpin problematic internet pornography use may give rise to the development of new treatment and relapse prevention strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

75,In many low-to-mid power applications. critical mode boost power factor corrector converters are widely used because of its low switching loss and simple control. However. near the zero crossing of the input line voltage. an input current distortion and a low power factor are caused by delayed switching period and negative input currents. Generally. an additional on-time method according to the input voltage is used to compensate the input current distortion. However. a detailed quantitative analysis for the exact additional on time has not been studied till now. In this paper. the explicit form of the optimized additional on time has been obtained using a quantitative analysis and the advantage of the digital control. From a state trajectory and "net input charge" analysis. it is shown that the optimized on time should be related to not only the input voltage. but also the output power. Also. in order to improve the efficiency in a high input and light load condition. circulating currents are reduced in the inevitable dead angle with a gate turning-off technique. By using digital control. the optimized additional on time and the gate turn-off technique have been implemented with the 90-230 V-rms input and 380 V/200 W output prototype....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Digital control
76,For Siewert type II adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEJ). the optimal surgical approach and extent of lymph nodes dissection remain controversial. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been reported to be available for identifying lymph node micrometastasis (LNMM) in patients with AEJ. This was a prospective case series of patients who underwent R0 resection and lower mediastinal lymphadenectomy from January 2010 to June 2015 in Fujian Medical University Union Hospital for Siewert type II AEJ. The outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 1325 lymph nodes were collected from 49 patients. grouped into 3 groups: lower mediastinal. paracardial. and abdominal. The former 2 groups were examined by monoclonal antibodies against Ber-Ep4 and CD44v6. The incidence of LNMM in mediastinal group was 37% (18/49) for Ber-Ep4 and 33% (16/49) for CD44v6. While in routine histological diagnosis. the number of patients with the positive lymph nodes was 7 (14%). When combining IHC with histopathology (HE) staining. the incidence of positive mediastinal lymph nodes was increased to 24%. with a total number of 37 lymph nodes from 28 patients (57%). Micrometastases indicated by Ber-Ep4 and CD44v6 were associated with the depth of tumor invasion (P=0.020 and 0.037. respectively). histopathological nodal status (P=0.024 and 0.01. respectively). and Lauren classification (P=0.038 and. respectively). Expression of CD44v6 and Ber-Ep4 was positively correlated (r=0.643. P<0.001). The 3- and 5-year survival rates for all patients were 66% and 50%. respectively. The patients with LNMM had a lower 3-year survival rate of 51%. compared to 80% from no LNMM group; 5-year survival rate was also lower in LNMM group. which is 29% versus 68% (P=0.006) in the no LNMM group. Patients with positive Ber-Ep4 cells had a lower survival. but not statistically significant (P=0.058). CD44v6-positive group had a significantly reduced survival (P<0.001). In patients group with negative lower mediastinal lymph nodes. patients without LNMM obtained a significant survival benefit (P=0.021). Our study demonstrated that routine test for LNMM is necessary for patients with negative lymph nodes. As a positive prognostic factor. thorough lower mediastinal lymphadenectomy in an invasive approach should be considered when necessary. Ber-Ep4 and CD44v6 were shown to be great markers for detecting LNMM....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Cancer
77,Aims: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is known as causative for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oropharynx. but is also found not infrequently in carcinomas of the sinonasal tract. Recently. a subset of these carcinomas was recognized to harbour HPV33 and have a significant morphological overlap with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). a rare and aggressive carcinoma originating in the minor salivary glands. Termed 'HPV-related carcinoma with ACC-like features'. only nine cases have been reported. To clarify the occurrence of these tumours we screened a large material for the presence of HPV-related ACC-like carcinoma. The identified tumours were characterized immunohistochemically and with fluorescence in-situ hybridization. and clinicopathological information for all cases is presented. Methods and results: Forty-seven candidate cases were screened for presence of HPV. Six cases were identified and genotyped as HPV types 33. 35. and 56. All six cases had areas of dysplastic mucosal lining and showed remarkable heterogeneous morphologies. MYB. MYBL1. and NFIB genes were intact and. interestingly. staining for MYB protein was largely negative in contrast to what was found in ACC. One patient experienced a local recurrence 11 years after initial treatment and the remaining five patients were alive without evidence of disease. Conclusion: We report six new cases of HPV-related ACC-like carcinoma and found that. although in a small material. the prognosis for these patients seems more favourable than for ACC. For the distinction between ACC and HPV-related ACC-like carcinoma. p16. MYB immunohistochemistry or investigation of MYB.

78,The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) and its receptor. chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis (AD). Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to measure the protein and mRNA expression of CXCL12 and CXCR4 in eutopic endometrial and ectopic foci tissue samples. Samples from a total of 36 patients with AD (study group) were compared with endometrial tissue samples from 33 patients who underwent uterine fibroids surgery (control group) during the same period. All data are presented as the mean +/- standard deviation and were analyzed with SPSS software (version 16.0). Analysis of variance was used for between group analysis and pairwise comparison was performed using Fisher's least significant difference post hoc test. The results of the present study revealed that CXCL12 and CXCR4 protein expression was significantly increased in ectopic foci tissue compared with eutopic endometrial tissue samples from patients with AD. CXCL12 and CXCR4 protein expression in ectopic foci and eutopic endometrial tissue samples were significantly increased compared with the control group (P< 0.05 for between group comparisons). No significant differences were identified in CXCL12 and CXCR4 protein expression between the proliferative and secretory phases within each group. Furthermore. CXCL12 and CXCR4 mRNA expression was significantly increased in ectopic foci tissue and eutopic endometrial tissue compared with the control group (P< 0.05 for between group comparisons). CXCL12 mRNA expression was markedly increased in ectopic foci tissue compared with eutopic endometrial tissue of patients with AD. The expression of CXCR4 mRNA was significantly increased in eutopic endometrial tissue compared with ectopic foci tissue and the control group (P< 0.05 for between group comparisons). No significant differences were identified in CXCL12 and CXCR4 mRNA expression between proliferative and secretory phase within each group. In conclusion. CXCL12 and CXCR4 may induce the ectopia. and promote the spread and localized growth of endometrial cells in the development of AD....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Alzheimer's Disease
79,Objective: We investigated the expression and potential roles of interleukin (IL)-2. IL-4. IL-6. IL-10. IL-17A. IL-37. Interferon (IFN)-gamma. and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) in patients with adenomyosis. Materials and methods: This prospective study examined 16 women with histologically proven adenomyosis and 52 women without adenomyosis. all of whom were undergoing a hysterectomy for non-endometrial pathology at the Department of Gynaecology. the First Hospital of Jilin University. Changchun. China. from December 2011 to September 2012. Serum samples were collected from the patients. and the concentrations of serum IL-2. IL-4. IL-6. IL-10. IL-17A. IL-37. IFN-gamma. and TNF were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). We then calculated specificity and sensitivity of cytokines. taking Cancer Antigen (CA) 125 as a reference. distinguishing cases from controls by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The correlation between individual cytokines and CA 125 was also analysed. Results: IL-37 was detectable in 69.2% and the other cytokines in 30.8% of sera samples from the 52 controls. All the eight cytokines were detectable in the sera samples from 16 patients with adenomyosis. Significantly higher levels of serum IL-37 and IL-10 and significantly lower levels of serum IL-17A and TNF were detected in adenomyosis patients when compared with controls (p< 0.05). Conclusions: Serum levels of IL-10. IL-17A. IL-37. and TNF varied significantly between cases and controls. and could be involved in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Menopause
80,Objectives: Inflammatory response and cytokine activation are markedly stimulated in skeletal muscle during various conditions. Interleukin-6 (IL-6). a pro-inflammatory cytokine. has pleiotropic effects on skeletal muscle. Adenosine. released by all cell types. binds to a class of G protein-coupled receptors to induce various skeletal muscle effects. The aim of this work was to investigate whether activation of adenosine receptors. particularly adenosine A2B receptors. could stimulate IL-6 gene expression in rat L6 skeletal muscle cells. Materials and Methods: The rat L6 skeletal muscle cells were cultured in 25 cm2 flasks. These differentiated cells were treated and then quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Probe-based) was used to analyze IL-6 gene expression level among different treatment conditions. Results: Adenosine-5'-N-ethyluronamide (NECA). a stable adenosine analogue. concentration-and time-dependently stimulates IL-6 gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. The effect of NECA is inhibited by a selective adenosine A2B receptor antagonist. PSB 603. By using cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-arising reagent forskolin. cAMP is found to be involved in the up-regulation of IL-6 induction. Conclusion: Here. a novel relationship between adenosine and IL-6 up-regulation has been demonstrated for the first time; IL-6 up-regulation induced by NECA is mediated by adenosine A2B receptor activation in skeletal muscle and is dependent on mainly a cAMP pathway. Adenosine A2B receptors are. thus. potentially important pharmacological targets in treating inflammation and related diseases in skeletal muscle tissues....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Ankylosing Spondylitis
81,Adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette proteins constitute a large family of active transporters through extracellular and intracellular membranes. Increased drug efflux based on adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette protein activity is related to the development of cancer cell chemoresistance. Several articles have focused on adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette gene expression profiles ( signatures). based on the expression of all 49 human adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette genes. in individual tumor types and reported connections to established clinicopathological features. The aim of this study was to test our theory about the existence of adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette gene expression profiles common to multiple types of tumors. which may modify tumor progression and provide clinically relevant information. Such general adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette profiles could constitute a new attribute of carcinogenesis. Our combined cohort consisted of tissues from 151 cancer patients- breast. colorectal. and pancreatic carcinomas. Standard protocols for RNA isolation and quantitative real- time polymerase chain reaction were followed. Gene expression data from individual tumor types as well as a merged tumor dataset were analyzed by bioinformatics tools. Several general adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette profiles. with differences in gene functions. were established and shown to have significant relations to clinicopathological features such as tumor size. histological grade. or clinical stage. Genes ABCC7. A3. A8. A12. and C8 prevailed among the most upregulated or downregulated ones. In conclusion. the results supported our theory about general adenosine triphosphate- binding cassette gene expression profiles and their importance for cancer on clinical as well as research levels. The presence of ABCC7 ( official symbol CFTR) among the genes with key roles in the profiles supports the emerging evidence about its crucial role in various cancers....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Polymerase chain reaction
82,Background:To perform a molecular epidemiological analysis of viral conjunctivitis among excess conjunctivitis cases recorded at the University Hospital of Patras. Greece. for the period March to June 2012. Methods: A structured questionnaire containing demographic and clinical data was developed in order to collect retrospective data on the cases. Eye swab specimens were collected and molecular detection of adenoviruses was performed by nested PCR. Positive results were confirmed by sequencing. To determine the relatedness between the isolated sequences. a phylogenetic analysis was conducted. Results: The epidemiological analysis (including retrospective data) included 231 conjunctivitis cases (47.1% male. and 52.8% female). Based on clinical features 205 of the cases were diagnosed of viral origin (46.3% male and 53.7% female). 4 of bacterial origin (50% male and 50% female) while 22 were undefined conjunctivitis. The outbreak excess cases (included 156 cases) affected all age groups regardless gender predilection. For the positive samples indicated that 29 samples (72.5%) were AdV17. and 5 (12.5%) as AdV54. Conclusions: Molecular analysis could define the cause of viral conjunctivitis. while epidemiological data contributed to the assessment of the risk factors and underlined possible preventive measures. This study is one of the very few on viral conjunctivitis in Greece. This outbreak underscores the need for a national surveillance system for acute infectious conjunctivitis outbreaks. The epidemiological as well as molecular investigation on HAdV ocular infections is rather absent in Greece. which has no surveillance system for viral conjunctivitis....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Hereditary Angioedema

The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR-delta) in endothelial activation remains poorly understood. In this study. we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of PPAR-delta and the mechanism involved. Methods and Results-In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). the synthetic PPAR-delta ligands GW0742 and GW501516 significantly inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin (assayed by real-time RT-PCR and Northern blotting). as well as the ensuing endothelial-leukocyte adhesion. Activation of PPAR-delta upregulated the expression of antioxidant genes superoxide dismutase 1. catalase. and thioredoxin and decreased reactive oxygen species production in ECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that GW0742 switched the association of BCL-6. a transcription repressor. from PPAR-delta to the vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM)-1 promoter. Small interfering RNA reduced endogenous PPAR-delta expression but potentiated the suppressive effect of GW0742 on EC activation. which suggests that the nonliganded PPAR-delta may have an opposite effect. Conclusions-We have demonstrated that ligand activation of PPAR-delta in ECs has a potent antiinflammatory effect. probably via a binary mechanism involving the induction of antioxidative genes and the release of nuclear corepressors. PPAR-delta agonists may have a potential for treating inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Hereditary Angioedema
85,Aims/hypothesis The aim of this study was to investigate changes in insulin sensitivity and expression of the gene encoding resistin (Retn) in adipocytes from long-term nitric oxide (NO)-deficient rats. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats received N-omega-nitro-Larginine methyl ester (L-NAME 0.5 mg/ml) in their drinking water for 4 weeks. while control rats received plain drinking water. During the experimental period. changes in plasma glucose. insulin and C-peptide levels were measured. After administration of L-NAME for 4 weeks. insulin sensitivity was evaluated in vivo and in vitro. An insulin binding assay was also performed to determine the number and binding affinity of insulin receptors in adipocytes. Adipocyte Retn mRNA levels were examined using northern blotting. Results Successful induction of NO deficiency was demonstrated by an increase in systemic blood pressure. No difference in plasma glucose levels was found between the two groups. Compared with the control rats. plasma insulin and C-peptide levels were significantly decreased in the NO-deficient rats. and insulin sensitivity was significantly increased. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and insulin binding capacity. but not binding affinity. were significantly increased in adipocytes isolated from NO-deficient rats. In addition. adipocyte Retn mRNA levels. but not plasma resistin levels. were significantly decreased in NO-deficient rats. and the Retn mRNA levels were negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity. Conclusions/interpretation Insulin sensitivity was increased in NO-deficient rats and this was associated with insulin binding capacity and downregulated Retn expression. These findings suggest that NO plays a regulatory role in metabolism. Dysregulation of NO production may result in the development of metabolic disorders....,biochemistry,Medical,Northern blotting,Alzheimer's Disease
86,Leptin is an adipocytokine that regulates body weight. and maintains energy homeostasis by promoting reduced food intake and increasing energy expenditure. Leptin expression and secretion is regulated by various factors including hormones and fatty acids. Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid that acts as source of energy in humans. We determined whether this fatty acid can play a role in leptin expression in fully differentiated human adipocytes. Mature differentiated adipocytes were incubated with or without increasing concentrations of butyrate. RNA was extracted and leptin mRNA expression was examined by Northern blot analysis. Moreover. the cells were incubated with regulators that may affect signals which may alter leptin expression and analyzed with Northern blotting. Butyrate stimulated leptin expression. and stimulated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phospho-CREB signaling in a time-dependent manner. Prior treatment of the cells with signal transduction inhibitors as pertusis toxin. G(i) protein antagonist. PD98059 (a MAPK inhibitor). and wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor) abolished leptin mRNA expression. These results suggest that butyrate can regulate leptin expression in humans at the transcriptional level. This is accomplished by: 1) G(i) protein-coupled receptors specific for short-chain fatty acids. and 2) MAPK and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (P13K) signaling pathways....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Northern blotting
87,Expression of the GLUT4 (glucose transporter type 4 isoform) gene in adipocytes is subject to hormonal or metabolic control. In the present study. we have characterized an adipose tissue transcription factor that is influenced by fasting/refeeding regimens and insulin. Northern blotting showed that refeeding increased GLUT4 mRNA levels for 24 h in adipose tissue. Consistent with an increased GLUT4 gene expression. the mRNA levels of SREBP (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein)-1c in adipose tissue were also increased by refeeding. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. insulin treatment increased the mRNA levels of GLUT4 in adipose tissue. Serial deletion. luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility-shift assay studies indicated that the putative sterol response element is located in the region between bases - 109 and - 100 of the human GLUT4 promoter. Transduction of the SREBP-1c dominant negative form to differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes caused a reduction in the mRNA levels of GLUT4. suggesting that SREBP-1c mediates the transcription of GLUT4. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that refeeding increased the binding of SREBP-1 to the putative sterol-response element in the GLUT4. Furthermore. treating streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats with insulin restored SREBP-1 binding. In addition. we have identified an Sp1 binding site adjacent to the functional sterol-response element in the GLUT4 promoter. The Sp1 site appears to play an additive role in SREBP-1c mediated GLUT4 gene upregulation. These results suggest that upregulation of GLUT4 gene transcription might be directly mediated by SREBP-1c in adipose tissue....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Northern blotting
88,Background: Autologous fat grafting is a prevalent technique used for softtissue augmentation; however. the poor survival rate of the grafted tissue remains a drawback of this method. Although adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are an attractive candidate for enhancing graft retention. the poor posttransplantation viability of these cells limits their application. Here we investigated whether overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) could enhance ASCs' therapeutic potential for fat transplant survival. Methods: Recombinant adenoviral vectors were used to overexpress Hsp70 in ASCs isolated from a healthy woman. The Hsp70 expression was assessed by quantitative real- time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses. The adipose tissue granules aspirated from anotherwomanweremixed with ASCs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Hsp70 (group A) or GFP alone (group B). untreated ASCs (group C). and phosphate-buffered saline (group D). Fat mixtures were then injected subcutaneously into the backs of nude mice. and graft survival was compared after 3 months. Results: Adipose-derived stem cells transduced with recombinant adenoviral vectors exhibited significantly increased Hsp70 expression in vitro. Meanwhile. weight retention analyses demonstrated that fat grafts using the group A cell population exhibited significantly higher survival rates than the other treatment groups in vivo. Moreover. histological analyses revealed that fat grafts containing GFP-Hsp70-expressing ASCs yielded significantly lower levels of tissue fibrosis and fat cysts/vacuoles. higher capillary densities. and increased numbers of viable adipocytes than the control groups. Conclusions: Our data indicate that Hsp70 overexpression enhances the efficacy of ASC therapy by improving the survival and quality of the transplanted fat tissues....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Myelofibrosis
89,Angiogenesis. a process induced by hypoxia in visceral white adipose tissues (vWAT) in the context of obesity. mediates obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance. Chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH) and sustained hypoxia (SH) induce body weight reductions and insulin resistance of different magnitudes. suggesting different hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha-related activity. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (n = 10-12/group) were exposed to either IH. SH. or room air (RA). vWAT were analyzed for insulin sensitivity (phosphorylated (pAKT)/AKT). HIF-1 alpha transcription using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing. angiogenesis using immunohistochemistry. and gene expression of different fat cell markers and HIF-1 alpha gene targets using quantitative polymerase chain reaction or microarrays. Body and vWAT weights were reduced in hypoxia (SH >IH >RA; P>>SH = RA; P < 0.001). IH induces preferential whitening of vWAT. as opposed to prominent browning in SH. Unlike SH. IH elicits early HIF-1 alpha activity that is unsustained over time and is accompanied by concurrent vascular rarefaction. inflammation. and insulin resistance. Thus. the dichotomous changes in HIF-1 alpha transcriptional activity and brown/beige/white fat balance in IH and SH should enable exploration of mechanisms by which altered sympathetic outflow. such as that which occurs in apneic patients. results in whitening. rather than the anticipated browning of adipose tissues that occurs in SH....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Heart Disease
90,Adipose tissue is a rich source of multipotent mesenchymal stem-like cells. located in the perivascular niche. Based on their surface markers. these have been assigned to two main categories: CD31(-)/CD45(-)/CD34(+)/CD146(-) cells (adventitial stromal/stem cells [ASCs]) and CD31(-)/CD45(-)/CD34(-)/CD146(+) cells (pericytes [PCs]). These populations display heterogeneity of unknown significance. We hypothesized that aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. a functional marker of primitivity. could help to better define ASC and PC subclasses. To this end. the stromal vascular fraction from a human lipoaspirate was simultaneously stained with fluorescent antibodies to CD31. CD45. CD34. and CD146 antigens and the ALDH substrate Aldefluor. then sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Individual ASCs (n=67) and PCs (n=73) selected from the extremities of the ALDH-staining spectrum were transcriptionally profiled by Fluidigm single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reaction for a predefined set (n=429) of marker genes. To these single-cell data. we applied differential expression and principal component and clustering analysis. as well as an original gene coexpression network reconstruction algorithm. Despite the stochasticity at the single-cell level. covariation of gene expression analysis yielded multiple network connectivity parameters suggesting that these perivascular progenitor cell subclasses possess the following order of maturity: (a) ALDH(br)ASC (most primitive); (b) ALDH(dim)ASC; (c) ALDH(br)PC; (d) ALDH(dim)PC (least primitive). This order was independently supported by specific combinations of class-specific expressed genes and further confirmed by the analysis of associated signaling pathways. In conclusion. single-cell transcriptional analysis of four populations isolated from fat by surface markers and enzyme activity suggests a developmental hierarchy among perivascular mesenchymal stem cells supported by markers and coexpression networks.

91,Extensive research has been performed to determine the effect of freezing protocol and cryopreservation agents on the viability of adipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) as well as other cells. Unfortunately. the conclusion one may draw after decades of research utilizing fundamentally similar cryopreservation techniques is that a barrier exists. which precludes full recovery. We hypothesize that agents capable of inducing a subset of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and chaperones will reduce the intrinsic barriers to the post-thaw recovery of ASCs. ASCs were exposed to 43 degrees C for 1 h to upregulate HSPs. and the temporal HSP expression profile postheat shock was determined by performing quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting assays. The expression levels of HSP70 and HSP32 were found to be maximum at 3 h after the heat shock. whereas HSP90 and HSP27 remain unchanged. The heat shocked ASCs cryopreserved during maximal HSPs expression exhibited increased post-thaw viability than the nonheat shocked samples. Histochemical staining and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR indicated that the ASC differentiation potential was retained. Thus. suggesting that the upregulation of HSPs before a freezing insult is beneficial to ASCs and a potential alternative to the use of harmful cryoprotective agents....,biochemistry,Medical,Polymerase chain reaction,Hereditary Angioedema
92,The long-term effect of feeding the catecholamine analog ractopamine (RAC; ractopamine hydrochloride. Elanco Animal Health. Indianapolis. IN) on the expression of genes involved in energy and lipid metabolism in subcutaneous adipose tissue was studied. Large White pigs (84 kg) were fed corn- and soybean meal-based diets supplemented with 0. 20. or 60 mg/kg of RAC for 14. 28. or 42 d. Expression (mRNA abundance) in adipose tissue of sterol regulatory binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). PPAR alpha. PPAR gamma 2. fatty acid synthase (FAS). glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). and stearoyl-CoA desaturase was determined by Northern blotting. Feed intakes did not differ. and RAC (20 and 60 mg/kg) improved BW gain at d 14. 28. and 42 (P < 0.05) and increased loin eye area (measured on d 42 only; P < 0.05). Expression of SREBP-1 and PPAR gamma 2 declined (P < 0.05) with RAC by d 28 and 42. whereas expression of PPAR alpha was increased (P < 0.05) on d 14. 28. and 42. After 14 d. expression of FAS and GLUT4 was decreased (P < 0.05) with 60 mg/kg of RAC. whereas both RAC concentrations attenuated FAS expression on d 28 and 42. Overall. adipose tissue stearoyl-CoA desaturase expression was not affected by RAC but showed somewhat less expression (P < 0.15) on d 28 at 60 mg/kg of RAC. Although prolonged. chronic RAC feeding most likely downregulates adipose tissue membrane beta-adrenergic receptors. mRNA abundances of anabolic lipid metabolism transcription factors. glucose transporters. and enzymes (SREBP-1. PPAR gamma 2. FAS. GLUT4) were still attenuated up to d 42. Conversely. a transcription factor related to oxidative metabolism expression (PPAR alpha) was enhanced. We conclude that even after 42 d. RAC still decreased expression of lipogenic genes in adipose tissue by yet undefined cyclic adenosine monophosphate-directed mechanisms. but in contemporary lean pigs. this effect is likely of limited practical significance....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Northern blotting,Human Metabolism
93,Conveyor systems allow quick and efficient transportation for a wide variety of materials. which make them very popular in the material handling and packaging industries. Many kinds of conveying systems are available and used according to the various needs of different industries. Adjustable speed drives are used for the operation of the conveyors used in a number of industries. We can use adjustable electric drives in a number of industrial applications. A typical adjustable speed drive consists of an induction motor and a power electronic converter. In most cases. motor speed is commanded so that the control system requires an actual speed signal for closing the speed loop. In industrial applications. speed sensors. as well as sensorless solutions. are used. Due to the possibility of current speed sensor noises and for maintenance and economic aspects. the trend is to substitute speed sensors by computational solutions. Comprehensive reviews of the sensorless drives show that there are still some persistent problems associated with the sensorless control. that needs new solutions. In ASDs. the advanced control approach of IM is the FOC method. used in modern industrial drives. The current stator controller is the integral part of various FOC systems. In the classical FOC solution. PI or hysteresis controllers are generally used. However. PCCs are reported to have better properties. System sensitivity to inaccuracy and changes of motor equivalent circuit parameters are another problem in electrical drives. Almost all of the FOC systems are very sensitive to such inaccuracies; therefore. some parameters should be estimated online. and a robust structure of the control is required. The real-time implementation of the system is an important task even for electric drives or power converters....,ECE,ECE,Digital control,Control engineering

95,Despite the immense public health successes of immunization over the past century. effective vaccines are still lacking for globally important pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus. malaria. and tuberculosis. Exciting recent advances in immunology and biotechnology over the past few decades have facilitated a shift from empirical to rational vaccine design. opening possibilities for improved vaccines. Some of the most important advancements include (i) the purification of subunit antigens with high safety profiles. (ii) the identification of innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and cognate agonists responsible for inducing immune responses. and (iii) developments in nano- and microparticle fabrication and characterization techniques. Advances in particle engineering now allow highly tunable physicochemical properties of particle-based vaccines. including composition. size. shape. surface characteristics. and degradability. Enhanced collaborative efforts between researchers in immunology and materials science are expected to rise to next-generation vaccines. This process will be significantly aided by a greater understanding of the immunological principles guiding vaccine antigenicity. immunogenicity. and efficacy. With specific emphasis on PRR-targeted adjuvants and particle physicochemical properties. this review aims to provide an overview of the current literature to guide and focus rational particle-based vaccine design efforts....,biochemistry,Medical,Immunology,Allergies
96,Critical issues about scientific reproducibility have been raised about biomedical research. including the reliability of data and analyses within a given study. The case example in this article examined a reproducibility issue pertaining to the use of administrative data systems for evaluation of child maltreatment (CM) prevention. making use of a prevention study conducted over a decade ago that provided a unique opportunity. The place-randomization study. which randomized counties to condition. found that community-wide implementation of a parenting and family support intervention produced positive impact on county-wide rates for substantiated CM cases and out-of-home placements. documented through a state information system. The key consideration is whether and to what extent the administrative record data re-examined retroactively a decade later for the original study's time period would yield comparable results to those based on data acquired at the time of the study. The results indicated that despite small changes over time. the same data patterns and statistical effects were reproducible for the two archival outcome variables. For substantiated CM. the reproduced analyses reflected higher effect sizes and a clear pattern of reduction as a function of intervention. For out-of-home placements. effect sizes were quite comparable to the original ones. reflecting preventive impact. Overall. this case study illustrated the verifiability of data reproducibility in the context of a population outcome evaluation. which underscores the importance of reliable population-prevalence measurement as an essential part of a comprehensive public health strategy aimed at the prevention of CM.

97,Aims: Ancient DNA (aDNA) extracted from historical bones is damaged and fragmented into short segments. present in low quantity. and usually copurified with microbial DNA. A wide range of DNA quantification methods are available. The aim of this study was to compare the five most common DNA quantification methods for aDNA. Materials and Methods: Quantification methods were tested on DNA extracted from skeletal material originating from an early medieval burial site. The tested methods included ultraviolet (UV) absorbance. real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) based on SYBR (R) green detection. real-time qPCR based on a forensic kit. quantification via fluorescent dyes bonded to DNA. and fragmentary analysis. Differences between groups were tested using a paired t-test. Results: Methods that measure total DNA present in the sample (NanoDrop (TM) UV spectrophotometer and Qubit (R) fluorometer) showed the highest concentrations. Methods based on real-time qPCR underestimated the quantity of aDNA. The most accurate method of aDNA quantification was fragmentary analysis. which also allows DNA quantification of the desired length and is not affected by PCR inhibitors. Conclusions: Methods based on the quantification of the total amount of DNA in samples are unsuitable for ancient samples as they overestimate the amount of DNA presumably due to the presence of microbial DNA. Real-time qPCR methods give undervalued results due to DNA damage and the presence of PCR inhibitors. DNA quantification methods based on fragment analysis show not only the quantity of DNA but also fragment length....,biochemistry,biochemistry,Polymerase chain reaction,Polymerase chain reaction
98,Considerable evidence suggests that adolescent exposure to delta-9-tetrahydrocanabinol (THC). the psychoactive component in marijuana. increases the risk of developing schizophrenia-related symptoms in early adulthood. In the present study. we used a combination of behavioral and molecular analyses with in vivo neuronal electrophysiology to compare the long-termeffects of adolescent versus adulthood THC exposure in rats. We report that adolescent. but not adult. THC exposure induces long-term neuropsychiatric-like phenotypes similar to those observed in clinical populations. Thus. adolescent THC exposure induced behavioral abnormalities resembling positive and negative schizophrenia-related endophenotypes and a state of neuronal hyperactivity in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway. Furthermore. we observed profound alterations in several prefrontal cortical molecular pathways consistent with sub-cortical DAergic dysregulation. Our findings demonstrate a profound dissociation in relative risk profiles for adolescent versus adulthood exposure to THC in terms of neuronal. behavioral. and molecular markers resembling neuropsychiatric pathology....,Psychology,Medical,Social cognition,Schizophrenia
99,Several studies have confirmed that maltreatment and abuse in childhood are related to conduct problems. Less is known about such relationships with concurrent adversities in adolescence and. also. when compared with other severe adversities and possible multiple additive effects. The study encompassed a community population of 4881 adolescents 15-16 years of age 50.1 % boys and 49.9 % girls. Youth with and without conduct problem scores within the deviant range on the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was compared on 12 concurrent adversities. Based on self-reports. 4.4 % of the adolescents had conduct problem scores within the deviant range and more girls (5.1 %) than boys (3.7 %). In the deviant conduct problem group. 65.1 % had experienced two or more concurrent adversities compared with 26.3 % of youths in the non-deviant group (OR 5.23. 95 % CI 3.91-7.01). Likewise. the deviant conduct problem group was from 1.71 to 8.43 times more at the risk of experiencing the different adversities. Parental mental health problems and experiences of violence were multivariately strongest associated with conduct problem scores within the deviant range on the SDQ. A strong multiple additive relationship with adversities was found. Two-thirds of youth with SDQ conduct problem scores within the deviant range reported two or more concurrent adversities. Clinicians should seek information about kinds and amount of possible traumatic adversities in youth with conduct problems and offer evidence based treatment....,Psychology,Psychology,Child abuse,Child abuse
